Flexible polymer films with various conductive fillers are preferred to address this problem due to their highly efficient and durable electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding performance.

In this work, robust flexible multifunctional AgNW/MXene/NiCo-C (AMN) films are fabricated by hierarchical casting assembly and an encapsulated conductive fabric strategy.

However, the origin of energetic disorder for OSCs remains poorly understood. Herein, we systematically investigate the energetic disorder in representative OSCs and the effect of both the acceptors and polymer donors by combining atomistic molecular dynamics simulations with density functional theory calculations. The results indicate that regardless of whether the OSCs are based on fullerene or acceptor-donor-acceptor (A-D-A) acceptors, the energetic disorder in the ionization potentials of the polymer donors is significantly larger than that in the electron affinities of the acceptors. Moreover, the energetic disorder of the donors matched with the fullerene acceptors is noticeably greater than that of the donors matched with the A-D-A acceptors. This implies that, different from our intuition, the reduction in the energetic disorder from the fullerene-based to A-D-A acceptor-based OSCs is primarily attributed to the change in the polymer donors rather than the acceptors.

The resulting perovskite film has a photoluminescence quantum yield of 17% and a Shockley-Read-Hall lifetime of nearly 7 microseconds and achieved a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.4% with an open-circuit voltage of 1.21 volts and a fill factor of 84.7%.

Description Editor\u2019s summary Many of the hole-transport materials used in inverted perovskite solar cells are either too hydrophobic to wet perovskite precursors or can react with the perovskite, which causes the buried interface between these layers to develop performance-limiting defects.

Currently, research works are focusing on constructing SAMs on metal oxide surfaces in p-i-n PSCs, but realizing a stable and dense SAM contact on halide perovskite surfaces in n-i-p PSCs is still challenging. In this work, the hole-selective molecule for n-i-p device is developed featuring a terephthalic methylammonium core structure that possesses double-site anchoring ability and a matching diameter (6.36 \u00c5) with the lattice constant of formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) perovskite (6.33 \u00c5), which facilitates an ordered and full-coverage SAM atop FAPbI3 perovskite. Moreover, theoretical calculations and experimental results indicate that compared to the frequently used acid or ester anchoring groups, this ionic anchoring group with a dipolar charge distribution has much larger adsorption energy on both organic halide terminated and lead halide terminated surfaces, resulting in synergistic improvement of carrier extraction and defect passivation ability. Benefiting from these merits, the efficiency of PSCs is increased from 21.68% to 24.22%.

This resulted in severe tin enrichment, and voids frequently occurred at the buried interfacial layer; herein, the Sn/Pb distribution was uneven through the TLP film.

The past decade has witnessed the rapid emergence of a new class of self-healing biomaterials commonly termed injectable, or printable in the context of 3D printing. These self-healing injectable biomaterials, mostly hydrogels and other soft condensed matter based on reversible chemistry, are able to temporarily fluidize under shear stress and subsequently recover their original mechanical properties. Self-healing injectable hydrogels offer distinct advantages compared to traditional biomaterials. Most notably, they can be administered in a locally targeted and minimally invasive manner through a narrow syringe without the need for invasive surgery. Their moldability allows for a patient-specific intervention and shows great prospects for personalized medicine. Injected hydrogels can facilitate tissue regeneration in multiple ways owing to their viscoelastic and diffusive nature, ranging from simple mechanical support, spatiotemporally controlled delivery of cells or therapeutics, to local recruitment and modulation of host cells to promote tissue regeneration. Consequently, self-healing injectable hydrogels have been at the forefront of many cutting-edge tissue regeneration strategies. This study provides a critical review of the current state of self-healing injectable hydrogels for tissue regeneration. As key challenges toward further maturation of this exciting research field, we identify (i) the trade-off between the self-healing and injectability of hydrogels vs their physical stability, (ii) the lack of consensus on rheological characterization and quantitative benchmarks for self-healing injectable hydrogels, particularly regarding the capillary flow in syringes, and (iii) practical limitations regarding translation toward therapeutically effective formulations for regeneration of specific tissues. Hence, here we (i) review chemical and physical design strategies for self-healing injectable hydrogels, (ii) provide a practical guide for their rheological analysis, and (iii) showcase their applicability for regeneration of various tissues and 3D printing of complex tissues and organoids.", "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-08-05", "synthetic_support_claim": "Self-healing injectable hydrogels can be administered through a narrow syringe for minimally invasive surgery.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "\"Self-healing injectable hydrogels can universally replace all traditional biomaterials in medical applications soon.\""}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "f9c3c38c958bd626e96e8d72d0a23914840272a2", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f9c3c38c958bd626e96e8d72d0a23914840272a2", "title": "Hydrogel-to-Nanoparticle Transition with Immune Cell Activation Controlled by Dual Supramolecular Interactions.", "abstract": "Biomolecules may undergo dynamic transitions between different aggregation states in order to adapt to the microenvironment.

In this work, the effects of the valence state and ionic radius of six cations, Li+, Na+, K+, Mg2+, Zn2+, and Al3+, on the performance of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-polystyrene sulfonic acid (PEDOT:PSS)-based ECDs are investigated. Both ion migration and diffusion are discussed as processes that were analyzed, with results indicating that the primary contributor to the response of ECDs is ion migration. The response time decreases with increasing ionic valence and ionic radius, with the valence state having the predominant effect on response speed. Multivalent ions, due to strong electric field forces, migrate more rapidly and intercalate fewer ions at equivalent reaction charges, thereby facilitating a faster response. ECDs with larger-radius ions, which exhibit slower diffusion rates, also achieve faster response speeds. Among the tested ECDs with various electrolytes, the Al3+-based ECD demonstrates the fastest colored/bleached response time of 0.36/0.4 s. In addition, ions with larger radii introduce greater steric hindrance and structural damage during insertion and extraction, leading to ion retention issues and reduced cycling stability. After 500 cycles (2025 s) under a square wave voltage of \u00b11.5 V, the peak current of ECDs with Li+ (0.60 \u00c5) electrolyte decreased by only 5.07/5.66%, whereas for K+ (1.33 \u00c5) electrolyte, the decrease was 11.55/12.37%. ECDs utilizing small-radius, higher-valence ions, such as Al3+, achieved both fast response and high cycling stability, with peak current reductions of only 6.98/5.01%. Additionally, the charge storage dynamics were examined by analyzing the contributions from surface-controlled and diffusion-controlled charges, further confirming that ion migration dominates in ECDs. The high contribution of surface-controlled charges (80%) supports the fast response of ECDs and contributes to the high coloration efficiency (592.6 cm2/C for Al3+-based devices).", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-11-11", "synthetic_support_claim": "The primary contributor to the response of electrochromic devices (ECDs) is ion migration.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Polymer stability in ECDs is unaffected by the ionic radius or valence state of cations used."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "556ef3d4eac2ef2a77005495ad9d80cf8e583b71", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/556ef3d4eac2ef2a77005495ad9d80cf8e583b71", "title": "Functional gel materials for next-generation electrochromic devices and applications.", "abstract": "Flexible, wearable, bistable displays, visualized energy storage devices and large-area smart windows based on electrochromic (EC) technology are regarded as promising next-generation sustainable display technologies, with the potential to improve people's lives by enabling low-energy consumption, vision-friendly, smart display, and energy-efficient building solutions.

Therefore, burn wound repair is extremely challenging in clinical practice. Herein, a series of self-healing hydrogels (QCS/OD/TOB/PPY@PDA) with good electrical conductivity and antioxidant activity were prepared on the basis of quaternized chitosan (QCS), oxidized dextran (OD), tobramycin (TOB), and polydopamine-coated polypyrrole nanowires (PPY@PDA NWs).

Hence, developing highly efficient, inexpensive, and noble-metal-free cocatalysts composed of earth-abundant elements is considered as a noteworthy step toward considering photocatalysis as a more economical strategy.

This is because the free energy cost for forming GUVs increases in solutions of high ionic strengths due increased adhesion between membranes. Gel coated glass slides used in gel-assisted assembly shows promise in assembling GUVs in salty solutions. However, only limited types of gel forming polymers are known to be effective. Extensive localized micrometer-scale dewetting of the polymer film from the substrate upon hydration results in low yields of GUVs from commonly used polymers such as agarose and polyvinyl alcohol. Furthermore, for polymers that show limited dewetting, increased temperatures, required for assembling GUVs composed of lipids with high transition temperatures, results in significant dewetting which limits the temperature at which assembly can occur. Here, we show that nanocellulose paper provides a facile means of suppressing dewetting of water-soluble polymers in the gel-assisted hydration method. With dewetting is suppressed, only low amounts of polymers are necessary to obtain high yields of GUVs. We show the significant extension of the temperature range of GUV assembly using paper supported gel-assisted hydration by assembling GUVs at high yield with raft forming mixtures that require assembly at 45 \u00b0C. Moreover, we demonstrate that using nanocellulose paper as a substrate allows the assembly of GUVs from novel polymer classes such as biocompatible hyaluronic acid and dextran.

Designing better electrolytes and interphases holds the key to the success of these batteries. As the only component that interfaces with every other component in the device, an electrolyte must satisfy multiple criteria simultaneously. These include transporting ions while insulating electrons between the electrodes and maintaining stability against electrodes of extreme chemical natures: the strongly oxidative cathode and the strongly reductive anode. In most advanced batteries, the two electrodes operate at potentials far beyond the thermodynamic stability limits of electrolytes, so the stability therein has to be realized kinetically through an interphase formed from the sacrificial reactions between electrolyte and electrodes. Description Progress and challenges for electrolytes Compared with the development of new cathodes and anodes, there has been less of a focus on the development of electrolytes. However, it is the electrolyte that controls the flow of ions and charges, and it is the only component in intimate contact with all the others. With the push toward higher energy and power densities, electrolytes are also involved in kinetically formed interphases that aid in the stability of a battery but can also hamper its operation. In a review, Meng et al. captures a number of trends that have emerged in the development of advanced battery electrolytes. \u2014MSL A review discusses progress in designing better electrolytes for electrochemical devices. BACKGROUND The electrolyte is an indispensable component in every electrochemical device, including lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). It physically segregates two electrodes from direct electron transfer while allowing working ions to transport both charges and masses across the cell so that the cell reactions can proceed sustainably. Whether powering our phones, driving our vehicles, or harvesting the intermittent energy from solar and wind farms, electrolytes in these LIBs determine how fast and how many times our devices can be recharged or how efficiently energy can be captured and stored over the grid. Occasionally, when an LIB is pushed away from the designed electrochemistry pathways by various factors such as excessive heat, mechanical mutilation, or internal short circuits induced under extreme charging conditions, electrolytes are also responsible for the fire and explosion accidents that we read about in the news. The electrolyte is the most unique component in a battery. Because it must physically interface with every other component, it is obligated to satisfy numerous constraints simultaneously, including rapidly transporting ions and masses, effectively insulating electrons, and maintaining stability toward the strongly oxidative cathode and strongly reductive anode. Historically, the electrolyte-anode interfacing was the last piece of the puzzle to complete modern LIB chemistry. ADVANCES The commercial success of LIBs has attracted intense interest and investments in electrolyte research, which led to the identification of interphases as the key component responsible for the stable and reversible operations of cathode and anode materials far beyond the thermodynamic stability limits of any known electrolyte. These interphases, often with nanometer thickness, are formed by electrolytes in a self-limiting decomposition process, and they ensure fast rates of charging and discharging, maximum voltage, and reversibility of LIBs. In the past three decades, the chemistry, morphology, and formation mechanisms of interphases have been thoroughly investigated. Researchers have learned how such interphases are structured and what key ingredients they comprise and, most importantly, how to tailor them using electrolyte engineering. Today, it is widely accepted that designing better electrolytes also implies designing the associated interphases for the electrode materials. Although the accurate prediction of interphasial chemistry remains difficult, and key fundamental properties of interphases such as the rate and mechanism of ion transport across interphases are still unknown, the structure of the ion solvation sheath has been identified as an effective tool that directs the formation process of interphases. Such knowledge has been driving a series of new electrolyte concepts for emerging battery chemistries. OUTLOOK Efforts are being made to develop battery chemistries that promise high energy density, rapid charging, low cost, high sustainability, and independence from elements or materials of high geopolitical or ethical risks. Each individual chemistry may demand a unique electrolyte and corresponding interphase, but a few universal trends emerge: (i) a super-concentration of salts is used to leverage unusual properties arising from the altered ion-solvation structures; (ii) both polymeric and inorganic materials are used to solidify electrolytes so that the aggressive lithium-metal anode can be harnessed with higher safety; (iii) efforts are made to identify the most effective interphasial ingredients so that an interphase of singular composition can be designed and artificially applied; (iv) liquefied gaseous components are used to expand the low-temperature limits of conventional electrolytes; and (v) unusual electrochemical behaviors are explored by confining ion-solvation sheaths in nano- or sub-nano environments. Electrolytes and the associated interphases play the central role in supporting diversified battery chemistries. On the anode side (left), the electrolyte must form an interphase that prevents graphitic anode from exfoliation, tolerates the drastic volume changes of a silicon electrode, and suppresses the growth of a dendritic form of lithium metal. On the cathode side (right), an interphase is critical in preventing the irreversible reactions with electrolytes, maintaining the lattice structure of transition metal oxides, suppressing the cross-cell shuttling of polysulfide species, and assisting the complicated triphasial reactions of an air-cathode. In all of these scenarios, interphases must enable ionic transport while insulating electronic transport.", "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-12-09", "synthetic_support_claim": "Designing better electrolytes for batteries implies designing the associated interphases for electrode materials.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Solid-state electrolytes are universally better than liquid electrolytes for all advanced battery chemistries."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "3e69fac95593c820fefe6f2664b35b8ac4480f52", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3e69fac95593c820fefe6f2664b35b8ac4480f52", "title": "Solutions for Lithium Battery Materials Data Issues in Machine Learning: Overview and Future Outlook", "abstract": "Abstract The application of machine learning (ML) techniques in the lithium battery field is relatively new and holds great potential for discovering new materials, optimizing electrochemical processes, and predicting battery life.

The chemical diversity and complexity of these materials, however, present major barriers to realizing this opportunity. In this work, we show that metal-catalyzed autoxidation depolymerizes comingled polymers into a mixture of oxygenated small molecules that are advantaged substrates for biological conversion. We engineer a robust soil bacterium, Pseudomonas putida, to funnel these oxygenated compounds into a single exemplary chemical product, either \u03b2-ketoadipate or polyhydroxyalkanoates. This hybrid process establishes a strategy for the selective conversion of mixed plastics waste into useful chemical products. Description Funneling mixed waste with microbes Current plastic recycling methods require sorting by chemical composition, a method that is expensive and results in products that are of lower quality and value than the starting plastic.

Pseudomonas putida actively forms biofilms to protect the population under tetracycline stress, but the molecular mechanism remains unclear. This study found that tetracycline at sub-minimal inhibitory concentrations increased cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP), a second messenger that positively regulates biofilm formation. Four c-di-GMP-metabolizing proteins were found to be involved in the tetracycline-mediated biofilm promotion, including DibA, WspR, PP_3242, and PP_3319. Among them, the diguanylate cyclase WspR displayed the most significant effect on c-di-GMP level and biofilm formation. WspR belongs to the wsp operon comprising seven genes (wspA\u2013wspF and wspR). The wsp operon contained six promoters, including one major start promoter (PwspA) and five internal promoters (PwspB, PwspC, PwspD, PwspF, and PwspR), and tetracycline promoted the activity of PwspA. The stress-response sigma factor RpoS directly bound to PwspA and positively regulated its activity under tetracycline stress. Moreover, RpoS was required for tetracycline to induce PwspA activity and promote biofilm formation. Our results enrich the transcriptional regulation of the wsp operon and reveal the mechanism by which tetracycline promotes biofilm formation in P. putida.

The Pseudomonas putida actively forms biofilm against antibiotic threats, but the mechanism remains unclear. Here, our results showed that tetracycline treatment at sub-minimal inhibitory concentrations could induce the expression of the Wsp system via the sigma factor RpoS in P. putida, resulting in elevated c-di-GMP levels, which leads to increased biofilm formation.

This amino-acid-engineered bionanozyme enables selective colorimetric detection of HSA, a critical urinary biomarker for kidney diseases, overcoming the challenge that HSA is neither a typical substrate nor an inhibitor for most nanozymes.

Boes et al. reviewed the science and technology of lithium niobate and its role in various aspects of photonic technology. They surveyed the evolution from bulk lithium niobate through weakly confining waveguides to the recent developments with thin-film lithium niobate. The ability to span the entire spectral range from radio to optical wavelengths illustrates the versatility of lithium niobate as a platform material in integrated photonics. \u2014ISO A review discusses the science and technology of lithium niobate and its role in various aspects of photonics. BACKGROUND Electromagnetic (EM) waves underpin modern society in profound ways. They are used to carry information, enabling broadcast radio and television, mobile telecommunications, and ubiquitous access to data networks through Wi-Fi and form the backbone of our modern broadband internet through optical fibers. In fundamental physics, EM waves serve as an invaluable tool to probe objects from cosmic to atomic scales. For example, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory and atomic clocks, which are some of the most precise human-made instruments in the world, rely on EM waves to reach unprecedented accuracies. This has motivated decades of research to develop coherent EM sources over broad spectral ranges with impressive results: Frequencies in the range of tens of gigahertz (radio and microwave regimes) can readily be generated by electronic oscillators. Resonant tunneling diodes enable the generation of millimeter (mm) and terahertz (THz) waves, which span from tens of gigahertz to a few terahertz. At even higher frequencies, up to the petahertz level, which are usually defined as optical frequencies, coherent waves can be generated by solid-state and gas lasers. However, these approaches often suffer from narrow spectral bandwidths, because they usually rely on well-defined energy states of specific materials, which results in a rather limited spectral coverage. To overcome this limitation, nonlinear frequency-mixing strategies have been developed. These approaches shift the complexity from the EM source to nonresonant-based material effects. Particularly in the optical regime, a wealth of materials exist that support effects that are suitable for frequency mixing. Over the past two decades, the idea of manipulating these materials to form guiding structures (waveguides) has provided improvements in efficiency, miniaturization, and production scale and cost and has been widely implemented for diverse applications. ADVANCES Lithium niobate, a crystal that was first grown in 1949, is a particularly attractive photonic material for frequency mixing because of its favorable material properties. Bulk lithium niobate crystals and weakly confining waveguides have been used for decades for accessing different parts of the EM spectrum, from gigahertz to petahertz frequencies. Now, this material is experiencing renewed interest owing to the commercial availability of thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN). This integrated photonic material platform enables tight mode confinement, which results in frequency-mixing efficiency improvements by orders of magnitude while at the same time offering additional degrees of freedom for engineering the optical properties by using approaches such as dispersion engineering. Importantly, the large refractive index contrast of TFLN enables, for the first time, the realization of lithium niobate\u2013based photonic integrated circuits on a wafer scale. OUTLOOK The broad spectral coverage, ultralow power requirements, and flexibilities of lithium niobate photonics in EM wave generation provides a large toolset to explore new device functionalities. Furthermore, the adoption of lithium niobate\u2013integrated photonics in foundries is a promising approach to miniaturize essential bench-top optical systems using wafer scale production. Heterogeneous integration of active materials with lithium niobate has the potential to create integrated photonic circuits with rich functionalities. Applications such as high-speed communications, scalable quantum computing, artificial intelligence and neuromorphic computing, and compact optical clocks for satellites and precision sensing are expected to particularly benefit from these advances and provide a wealth of opportunities for commercial exploration. Also, bulk crystals and weakly confining waveguides in lithium niobate are expected to keep playing a crucial role in the near future because of their advantages in high-power and loss-sensitive quantum optics applications. As such, lithium niobate photonics holds great promise for unlocking the EM spectrum and reshaping information technologies for our society in the future. Lithium niobate spectral coverage.

To accommodate these applications, suitable methods for generating the quantum states are needed. Today, the quantum states are often produced by a spontaneous nonlinear process in a standard nonlinear material, followed by a series of optical elements necessary for encoding the desired state on the generated photons. In this review, we consider an alternative approach of structuring the nonlinearity of the crystal so that the desired quantum state will be generated directly at the crystal, without the need for additional elements. Our main focus here is on bulk crystals having structured second-order nonlinearity. The rising interest in these nonlinear metamaterials is fueled by advancements in the ability to efficiently simulate and design spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) processes, as well as by new capabilities of structuring the nonlinearity of ferroelectric crystals, either by electric field poling or by laser-induced writing.

However, conventional electrolytes containing free active solvents are highly susceptible to decomposition, particularly at the interfaces of lithium anode and high-voltage cathode. Herein, we have developed a composite quasi-solid electrolyte (CQSE) utilizing sulfated Al2O3 (S-Al2O3)-bridged cellulose triacetate (CTA) to stabilize the interfaces between the electrolyte and electrodes. S-Al2O3 competitively dissociates Li+ through coordination interactions with anions, facilitating the formation of a distinctive solvation structure characterized by prevalent ion pairs and aggregates. In addition, coordination of S-Al2O3 with CTA forms S-Al2O3-bridged CTA molecular chain networks, enhancing the mechanical strength of the CQSE and immobilizing free liquid molecules. Consequently, the CQSE demonstrates an enhanced tensile strength of up to 7.4 MPa and a high ionic conductivity of 1.8 \u00d7 10-3 S cm-1 at room temperature.

We demonstrate the ability of high-entropy metal cation mixes to improve ionic conductivity in a compound, which leads to less reliance on specific chemistries and enhanced synthesizability. The local distortions introduced into high-entropy materials give rise to an overlapping distribution of site energies for the alkali ions so that they can percolate with low activation energy. Experiments verify that high entropy leads to orders-of-magnitude higher ionic conductivities in lithium (Li)\u2013sodium (Na) superionic conductor (Li-NASICON), sodium NASICON (Na-NASICON), and Li-garnet structures, even at fixed alkali content. We provide insight into selecting the optimal distortion and designing high-entropy superionic conductors across the vast compositional space. Description High entropy by design A key property for solid-state battery electrolytes is the ability to rapidly transport lithium ions. This property can be achieved by developing a percolating pathway or by increasing the mobility of the carrier ions in the electrolyte. However, standard design methods limit the selection of dopants and complicate the synthesis. Zeng et al. adapted some of the concepts of high-entropy materials to the development of solid electrolytes (see the Perspective by Botros and Janek). The addition of a mixture of high-entropy metal cations induces local disorder, thus creating overlapping site energy distributions for charge-carrying ions. This approach results in a percolating network of connected sites with a reduced energy difference and correspondingly fast lithium ion transport, as demonstrated for lithium- and sodium-based batteries. \u2014MSL High-entropy design can lead to orders of magnitude increases in ionic conductivity regardless of the crystal framework.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-12-23", "synthetic_support_claim": "High-entropy design can lead to orders of magnitude increases in ionic conductivity regardless of the crystal framework.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "High-entropy metal cation mixes enhance battery cycling stability in all solid-state battery designs."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "9edc33d4e49a517ee0ebf094b8d6d6d9031de4a9", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9edc33d4e49a517ee0ebf094b8d6d6d9031de4a9", "title": "High Entropy Oxide Duplex Yolk-Shell Structure with Isogenic Amorphous/Crystalline Heterophase as a Promising Anode Material for Lithium-Ion Batteries.", "abstract": "Achieving composition and structure regulation on high entropy materials is a big challenge but will give this kind of new materials a huge boost in energy storage.

Nevertheless, such strong electrostatic interaction between bivalent Mg2+ and crystalline cathode materials will lead to low capacity and poor diffusion kinetics, which seriously hinders the further development of magnesium-ion batteries. Herein, amorphization and anion-rich strategies are employed to prepare well-designed cathode materials with MoS3 anchored on hollow carbon nanospheres (a-MoS3/HCS). The amorphous MoS3 provides unrestricted 3D diffusion access and effectively boosts the Mg2+ diffusion kinetics, while the anion-rich feature of MoS3 offers rich active sites for Mg2+ storage and finally contributes to a high discharge capacity driven by the anionic redox mechanism. Moreover, the effective modification of hollow carbon nanospheres buffers the volumetric changes of MoS3 and improves the electron transfer efficiency. Owing to the above-mentioned multiple advantages, a-MoS3/HCS exhibits an ultrahigh discharge capacity (489.2 mAh g-1 at 50 mA g-1) and high cyclic performance (200.1 mAh g-1 at 2 A g-1 for 300 cycles), distinctly superior to those of crystalline 1T/2H-MoS2/HCS and 2H-MoS2/HCS and surpassing almost all of the molybdenum sulfide-based cathodes.

The formation of nanohybrids after the addition of protein shows a tendency to positive values, indicating a significant effect of protein on the surface characteristics of SeNPs. The antibacterial activity of enterocin was studied. It was established that the effectiveness of synthesized selenium nanoparticles (SeNP) against the studied bacteria was lower than that of the synthesized nanohybrid. The study of the antioxidant activity of nanohybrids showed that nanohybrids can absorb free radicals in a larger range than enterocin alone. Thus, the literature data illustrate the enhanced antioxidant activity of the nanohybrid in vitro and better antibacterial activity against MDR bacteria compared to enterocin alone, which indicates the possibility of its use in various industries, in particular in the food and medical industries. The article studied publications only on the in vitro antibacterial and antioxidant effects of enterocin and nanohybrids. At the same time, there is a need for research to study additional effects of the bioactivity of nanohybrids as antifungal and antitumor agents.\nKey words: Selenium nanoparticles, bacteria, antibacterial activity, antioxidant, bacteriocins.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-11-28", "synthetic_support_claim": "The synthesized selenium nanohybrids demonstrate better antibacterial efficacy against MDR bacteria compared to enterocin alone.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) safely enhance the human gut microbiome when used in dietary supplements."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "3f9a3b0b0ca2932695fb61c5e363256443b61ab1", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3f9a3b0b0ca2932695fb61c5e363256443b61ab1", "title": "Glucose-Activated Programmed Hydrogel with Self-Switchable Enzyme-Like Activity for Infected Diabetic Wound Self-Adaptive Treatment.", "abstract": "The defective blood glucose regulation ability of diabetic patients leading to bacterial infection, cellular oxidative stress, and vascular damage results in delayed healing of chronic diabetic wounds.

However, light-induced bandgap instability due to ion migration in mixed-halide perovskites remains a significant challenge to the efficiency of optoelectronic devices. Thus, we combined hyperspectral fluorescence microspectroscopy and computational methods to understand the underlying transition mechanism between phase reconstruction and segregation in CsPbBr3-xIx (0 < x < 3) nanocrystal thin films. Our outcomes have shown that samples with x = 1.0 and x = 1.5 exhibit halide migration, favoring Br enrichment locally. In this case, an interplay between photo and thermal activation promotes the expulsion of I- from the perovskite lattice and generates a reconstruction of Br-rich domains, forming the CsPbBr3 phase. Thus, thermodynamic parameters such as the halide activation energy and phase reconstruction diffusibility were obtained by combining the kinetic parameters from linear unmixing data and Fick's second law. Moreover, we observed that the Br-I interdiffusion followed an Arrhenius-like behavior over laser-induced temperature increase. On the other hand, for samples with x = 2.0, phase segregation occurred due to the larger CsPbBrI2 nanocrystal size, iodine content and the high laser intensity employed. These three combined effects modify transport and recombination due to the reduction of charge carrier diffusion length (LD = 10.2 nm) and bandgap. Thus, iodide ions diffuse from the nanocrystal surface to the core forming a \"type-II heterostructure\", promoting a red shift in the fluorescence spectrum, which is characteristic of phase segregation.

In recent years, the anti\u2010inflammatory function of hydrogel dressings has been significantly improved, addressing many clinical challenges presented in ongoing endeavours to promote wound healing. Wound healing is a cascaded and highly complex process, especially in chronic wounds, such as diabetic and severe burn wounds, in which adverse endogenous or exogenous factors can interfere with inflammatory regulation, leading to the disruption of the healing process. Although insufficient wound inflammation is uncommon, excessive inflammatory infiltration is an almost universal feature of chronic wounds, which impedes a histological repair of the wound in a predictable biological step and chronological order. Therefore, resolving excessive inflammation in wound healing is essential. In the past 5 years, extensive research has been conducted on hydrogel dressings to address excessive inflammation in wound healing, specifically by efficiently scavenging excessive free radicals, sequestering chemokines and promoting M1\u2010to\u2010M2 polarization of macrophages, thereby regulating inflammation and promoting wound healing.

Sodium-ion batteries (NIBs), which possess a similar cell configuration and working mechanism, have already been proven as ideal alternatives for large-scale energy storage systems. The advantages of NIBs are as follows. First, sodium resources are abundantly distributed in the earth\u2019s crust. Second, high-performance NIB cathode materials can be fabricated by using solely inexpensive and noncritical transition metals such as manganese and iron, which further reduces the cost of the required raw materials. Recently, the unprecedented demand for lithium and other critical minerals has driven the cost of these primary raw materials (which are utilized in LIBs) to a historic high and thus triggered the commercialization of NIBs. Sodium layered transition metal oxides (NaxTMO2, TM = transition metal/s), such as Mn-based sodium layered oxides, represent an important family of cathode materials with the potential to reduce costs, increase energy density and cycling stability, and improve the safety of NIBs for large-scale energy storage. However, these layered oxides face several key challenges, including irreversible phase transformations during cycling, poor air stability, complex charge-compensation mechanisms, and relatively high cost of the full cell compared to LiFePO4-based LIBs. Our work has focused on the techno-economic analysis, the degradation mechanism of NaxTMO2 upon cycling and air exposure, and the development of effective strategies to improve their electrochemical performances and air stability.

Then the techno-economics are presented, with an emphasis on cathodes with different chemical compositions, cost breakdown of battery packs, and Na deficiency, factors that are critical to the large-scale implementation.

Elucidating the relationship between variations on the molecular scale and macroscopic observable properties facilitates an understanding of the molecular interactions driving the properties of real world materials and complex systems (e.g., those found in biology, chemistry, and materials science). As a result, discovering an explicit, systematic connection between microscopic nature and emergent mesoscopic behavior is a fundamental goal for this type of investigation. The molecular forces critical to driving the behavior of complex heterogeneous systems are often unclear. More problematically, simulations of representative model systems are often prohibitively expensive from both spatial and temporal perspectives, impeding straightforward investigations over possible hypotheses characterizing molecular behavior. While the reduction in resolution of a study, such as moving from an atomistic simulation to that of the resolution of large coarse-grained (CG) groups of atoms, can partially ameliorate the cost of individual simulations, the relationship between the proposed microscopic details and this intermediate resolution is nontrivial and presents new obstacles to study. Small portions of these complex systems can be realistically simulated. Alone, these smaller simulations likely do not provide insight into collectively emergent behavior. However, by proposing that the driving forces in both smaller and larger systems (containing many related copies of the smaller system) have an explicit connection, systematic bottom-up CG techniques can be used to transfer CG hypotheses discovered using a smaller scale system to a larger system of primary interest. The proposed connection between different CG systems is prescribed by (i) the CG representation (mapping) and (ii) the functional form and parameters used to represent the CG energetics, which approximate potentials of mean force (PMFs). As a result, the design of CG methods that facilitate a variety of physically relevant representations, approximations, and force fields is critical to moving the frontier of systematic CG forward. Crucially, the proposed connection between the system used for parametrization and the system of interest is orthogonal to the optimization used to approximate the potential of mean force present in all systematic CG methods. The empirical efficacy of machine learning techniques on a variety of tasks provides strong motivation to consider these approaches for approximating the PMF and analyzing these approximations.", "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-09-07", "synthetic_support_claim": "The proposed connection between smaller and larger systems facilitates transferring hypotheses using systematic bottom-up CG techniques.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Machine learning can optimize molecular dynamics simulations to be more efficient than coarse-grained modeling approaches."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "5cafc27f1a4af5348ad1d3a1697838fc78df5617", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5cafc27f1a4af5348ad1d3a1697838fc78df5617", "title": "Microtubule dynamics are defined by conformations and stability of clustered protofilaments", "abstract": "Microtubules are dynamic cytoskeletal polymers that add and lose tubulin dimers at their ends.

Recent evidence suggests that flexible tubulin protofilaments at microtubule ends adopt a variety of shapes, complicating structural analysis using conventional techniques. Therefore, the link between GTP hydrolysis, protofilament structure and microtubule polymerization state is poorly understood. Here, we investigate the conformational dynamics of microtubule ends using coarse-grained modeling supported by atomistic simulations and cryo-electron tomography. We show that individual bent protofilaments organize in clusters, transient precursors to a straight microtubule lattice, with GTP-bound ends showing elevated and more persistent cluster formation. Differences in the mechanical properties of GTP- and GDP-protofilaments result in differences in intra-cluster tension, determining both clustering propensity and protofilament length. We propose that conformational selection at microtubule ends favors long-lived clusters of short GTP-protofilaments that are more prone to form a straight microtubule lattice and accommodate new tubulin dimers. Conversely, microtubule ends trapped in states with unevenly long and stiff GDP-protofilaments are more prone to shortening.

Zeolite, a bioceramic with an aluminosilicate structure, exhibits high mechanical resistance, making it ideal for use in areas of the body that endure significant pressure, such as bones and teeth. Chitosan, on the other hand, possesses excellent properties for application in various bodily tissues. However, natural polymers like chitosan are often combined with other materials in composites to enhance their mechanical resistance. This research investigates the antibacterial properties of a biocomposite made from zeolite and chitosan against two types of bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus (gram-positive) and Escherichia coli (gram-negative).

In this context, MgO is a highly promising, earth-abundant CO2 sorbent. However, despite its favorable carbonation thermodynamics and potential for high gravimetric CO2 uptakes, MgO-based CO2 sorbents feature slow carbonation kinetics, limiting their CO2 uptake during typical industrial contact times. The addition of molten alkali metal nitrate promoters, such as NaNO3, can partially mitigate the slow kinetics. Here, we investigate how the CO2 uptake kinetics of NaNO3-promoted MgO can be increased further through the addition of finely dispersed Na2CO3. The incorporation of Na2CO3 significantly increases the CO2 uptake rate from 1.4 to 14.6 mmol MgCO3 (mol MgO)\u22121 s\u20131. Using in situ synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), we track the formation of MgCO3 and elucidate the mechanism through which Na2CO3 promotes the CO2 uptake of MgO. Our findings demonstrate that Na2CO3 rapidly converts within seconds into Na2Mg(CO3)2 during carbonation, acting subsequently as nucleation seeds for MgCO3 formation, in turn significantly enhancing CO2 uptake kinetics. Further, the presence of Na2Mg(CO3)2 considerably enhances the mobility of ions in the sorbent, leading to sintering of MgCO3. Importantly, Na2Mg(CO3)2 promotes MgCO3 formation even in the presence of molten RbNO3, a salt with a limited ability to dissolve [Mg2+\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7CO32\u2013] ion pairs, indicating that Na2Mg(CO3)2 lowers the critical ion pair concentration required for MgCO3 nucleation.

Here, we report that chiral organic molecular cages can become an appealing chiral system to realize highly efficient spin filtering through the chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect. A pair of triphenylphosphine-containing organic cages (Pcages) with opposite handedness can manifest a very high spin polarization of nearly 90% and a high conductivity that exceeds those of other chiral molecules and structures by 2 orders of magnitude. By fabricating such molecular cages into thin-film spin filter devices, they have outstanding magnetoresistance ratios up to 12% among most of the devices based on the CISS effect. More interestingly, the Pcages can self-assemble with triphenylborane molecules through B-P frustrated Lewis acid-base complexation to form homochiral helical supramolecular nanofibrils.

Crucially, this study discovers that a negative shift in the d\u2010band center, a previously overlooked factor, is responsible for this broadening phenomenon. By inducing cation vacancies and heterostructures, a negative shift in the d\u2010band center gives rise to an increase in carrier concentration and promotion of charge separation, resulting in higher conductive and polarization losses, ultimately leading to a broader absorption bandwidth. The applicability of this concept is validated in another distinctly different system, where the absorption bandwidth also experiences a remarkable increase (from 0 to 6.86 GHz).

According to the mechanical test, including compression, splitting tensile, and flexural tests, the waste glass powder creates a better pozzolanic effect and increases the strength, while the glass particles tend to decrease the strength when they are swapped with aggregates. As observed in the splitting tensile test, noteworthy progress in the tensile strength of the concrete was achieved by 14%, while the waste glass used as a fractional replacement for the fine aggregate. In samples where glass particles were swapped with CA, the tensile strength tended to decrease. It was noticed that with the adding of waste glass at 10%, 20%, 40%, and 50% of FA swapped, the increase in flexural strength was 3.2%, 6.3%, 11.1%, and 4.8%, respectively, in amount to the reference one (6.3 MPa).

The results of rumen microbial sequencing showed that the Chao1, Observed species, and PD_whole_tree indices of the ZnONP group were higher than those of the control group. The addition of ZnONPs altered the composition of the rumen microbiota, increasing the abundance of beneficial bacteria (Prevotella and Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group) and decreasing the abundance of the harmful bacterium Sediminispirochaeta. Non-targeted metabolomics analysis identified a total of 261 differential metabolites between the two groups, indicating changes in rumen metabolism.

In addition, a positive correlation was observed between milk yield and beneficial bacteria (RF39 and Clostridia vadinBB60 group), as well as between milk fat content and Quinella (p\u2009<\u20090.05).

These devices collect massive amounts of seawater for desalination, cooling, and processing. These industries\u2019 performance and cost-effectiveness depend on seawater intake system reliability. In hostile marine environments, seawater intake systems face biofouling, silt, and corrosion.\n Biofouling plagues seawater intake systems. Wet intake screens and lines support bacteria, plants, algae, and animals. BIOFouling jams screens and prevents water flow. It also causes corrosion and increases maintenance, reducing intake system performance. Mechanical cleaning, biocides, and antifouling coats treat biofouling. These solutions may work temporarily but harm the environment. Biocides can harm unintended sea creatures and render biofouling resistant. Sediment buildup troubles ocean intake systems. Intake channels and lines can acquire sea sand, silt, and organic garbage. Deposition reduces water flow cross-sectional area, making the device less efficient and more energy-intensive to pump. Sediment and wear can damage motor parts and increase maintenance expenses. Hard dredging and hand flushing may not remove all silt. Saltwater and air in the marine environment erode seawater intake system metals. System corrosion increases maintenance costs by weakening buildings and requiring additional repairs. Two strategies to prevent rust are coatings and cathodic protection. These methods require continual monitoring and maintenance. Due to these issues, we need better techniques to evaluate and clean seawater entry systems to improve performance and longevity. Technology makes solving and maintaining these issues straightforward. This study discusses robotic inspection systems, eco-friendly cleaning solutions, ultrasonic cleaning, and built-in tracking. Robotic inspection devices improve seawater intake system care. These self-driving or remotely operated automobiles can navigate difficult terrain and provide real-time intake structure data thanks to their high-resolution cameras and sophisticated sensors. Robotic examinations pinpoint biofouling, silt, and corrosion maintenance sites. This reduces hand checks in dangerous spots and improves maintenance accuracy and speed. Innovative biofouling solutions include eco-friendly cleansers. These marine compounds degrade naturally and are harmless for all life. They eliminate biofilms and organic debris without harming other organisms. Cleaning products are evaluated in the lab and field to ensure efficacy and environmental safety. Maintenance with eco-friendly cleaning products is better for the environment than biocides. Ultrasonic cleaning safely removes biofilms and sediments from seawater-absorbing systems. Ultrasonic waves move debris, and water removes it. This method cleans surfaces well and reduces handwashing. Ultrasonic cleaning can be done regularly or continually depending on intake system needs. Combine it with other maintenance methods for optimum results. Integrating robotic scans, chemical sensors, and ultrasonic devices gives a complete intake system view. Advanced data analytics and prediction algorithms can detect biofouling, silt buildup, and corrosion early. Real-time monitoring and planning for planned maintenance via integrated monitoring systems improves efficiency and prevents breakdowns. Seawater intake systems will last longer and operate better with this precaution. These new inspection and cleaning methods have several benefits. Their reliability and efficiency ensure the seawater intake system functions effectively in critical industrial applications. Second, by using fewer chemicals and extending life, they reduce environmental impact. Third, they reduce manual inspections and cleanings in risky sea conditions, making personnel safer. Finally, they reduced repairs, replacements, downtime, and staff expenditures. Problems with seawater entrance systems require imaginative inspection and cleaning.

Marine black shales, which are rich in U and Th, are widespread in the Ediacaran Doushantuo Formation of the Upper Yangtze Platform, making them a key target for helium exploration.

This study focuses on shales from the Doushantuo Formation in Chongqing, China, aiming to explore the mechanisms of U and Th accumulation and assess the potential for helium generation, and argillaceous dolomites are included for comparative analysis. The results show that the average U and Th content in the black shales (17.58 and 9.78 ppm, respectively) is higher than that of argillaceous dolomites (3.52 and 2.75 ppm, respectively). Uranium mainly comes from authigenic precipitation and hydrothermal inputs, while thorium is primarily sourced from terrigenous and hydrothermal inputs. The semi-humid climate in the provenance area facilitated parent rock weathering, with atmospheric precipitation and river systems transporting U and Th to the ocean.

Here, we develop a high-performance anode for aqueous Zn-ion batteries via a lattice expansion strategy in combination with a Zn2+/H+ synergistic mechanism.

The high electrochemical performance is attributed to a decrease in the Zn2+/H+ diffusion barriers, which results from lattice expansion and also a H+-promoted Zn2+ intercalation effect. The anode intercalates Zn2+/H+ via a solid-solution mechanism with a minor volume change, which contributes to the high reversibility and thus high energy efficiency.

Catalytic conversion of CO2 using thermochemical, electrochemical, and photochemical methods is a potential technique to decrease the CO2 concentration and simultaneously obtain value-added chemicals. Due to the high energy barrier of CO2 however, this method is still far from large-scale applications which requires high activity, selectivity, and stability. Therefore, development of efficient catalysts to convert CO2 to different products is urgent. With their well-engineered pores and chemical compositions, high surface area, elevated CO2 adsorption capability, and adjustable active sites, porous crystalline frameworks including metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are potential materials for catalytic CO2 conversion. Here, we summarize our recent work on MOFs and COFs for thermocatalytic, electrocatalytic, and photocatalytic CO2 conversion and describe the structure-activity relationships that could guide the design of effective catalysts.The first section of this paper describes imidazolium-functionalized porous MOFs, including porous liquid and cationic MOFs with nucleophilic halogen ions, which can promote thermocatalytically CO2 cycloaddition reaction with epoxides toward cyclic carbonates at one bar pressure. A porous liquid MOF takes on the role of a CO2 reservoir to tackle the low local CO2 concentrations in gas-liquid-solid heterogeneous reactions. Imidazolium-functionalized MOFs with halogen ions for CO2 cycloaddition could avoid the use of cocatalysts, and this leads to milder and more facile experimental conditions and separation processes.In a section dealing with the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), we developed a series of conductive porous framework materials with fast electron transmission capabilities, which afford high current densities and outperform the traditional MOF and COF catalysts that have been reported. The intrinsically conductive two-dimensional 2D MOFs and COFs nanosheets based on the fully \u03c0-conjugated phthalocyanine motif with excellent electron transport capability were prepared, and strong electron transporters were also integrated into metalloporphyrin-based COFs for CO2RR. Cu2O quantum dots and Cu nanoparticles (NPs) can be uniformly dispersed on porous conductive MOFs/COFs to afford synergistic and/or tandem electrocatalysts, which can achieve highly selective production of CH4 or C2H4 in CO2RR.A third section describes our efforts to facilitate electron-hole separation in CO2 photocatalysis. Our focus is on regulation of coordination spheres in MOFs, fabrication of the architecture of MOF heterojunctions, and engineering MOF films to facilitate photocatalytic CO2 reduction.Finally, we discuss several problems associated with the studies of MOFs and COFs for CO2 conversion and consider some prospects of the fabrication of effective porous frameworks for CO2 adsorption and conversion.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-09-26", "synthetic_support_claim": "Imidazolium-functionalized MOFs promote CO2 cycloaddition with epoxides toward cyclic carbonates at one bar pressure.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "MOFs and COFs can achieve large-scale industrial CO2 conversion efficiently with current technologies."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "f240c6724e3ff2b9eede00c8ad2ca69b3873e113", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f240c6724e3ff2b9eede00c8ad2ca69b3873e113", "title": "Subtle Tuning of Catalytic Well Effect in Phthalocyanine Covalent Organic Frameworks for Selective CO2 Electroreduction into C2H4.", "abstract": "In the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), the strategic design of a catalytic well capable of regulating the overall confinement effects of catalytic sites holds significant promise for enhancing multiple-electron transfer and C\u2500C coupling efficiency, particularly for the generation of C2+ products.

The meticulously engineered catalytic well, facilitated by multi-hydroxyl groups, manifests robust confinement effects, facilitating selective adsorption, enrichment, and activation of CO2, intermediate stabilization, and reduction of energy barriers for electrocatalytic CO2RR. Specifically, product selectivity can be finely tuned from CH4 to C2H4 by modulating the levels of catalytic well, with CuPc-DFP-4OH-Cu exhibiting the most pronounced catalytic well effect, yielding a high 56.86% faradaic efficiency (FE) for C2H4 at -0.7 V, while CuPc-DFP-Cu, with the weakest catalytic well effect, achieves a 75.24% FE for CH4 at -1.0 V.

We report herein mechanochemical (MC) nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) that enables sulfur conversion into thianthrene-bridged porous ladder polymer networks with dense donor-acceptor (D-A) molecular junctions. We demonstrate that the key lies in the generation of bent thianthrene units through a solid-state ball-milling condensation reaction between 1,2-dihaloarenes and elemental sulfur.

Compared with those established porous materials such as zeolites, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), and covalent-organic frameworks (COFs), it is much more difficult to stabilize HOFs and thus establish their permanent porosities given the fact that hydrogen bonds are typically weaker than ionic, coordination, and covalent bonds. But it provides the uniqueness of HOF materials in which they can be easily recovered and regenerated through simple recrystallization. HOF materials can also be easily and straightforwardly processed and very compatible with the biomolecules, making them potentially very useful materials for industrial and biomedical applications. The reversible and weak bonding nature of the hydrogen bonds can be readily utilized to construct flexible porous HOF materials in which we can tune the temperature and pressure to control their porosities and, thus, their diverse applications, for example, on gas separations, gas storage, drug delivery, and sensing. Some specific organic functional groups are quite directional for the hydrogen bond formations; for example, carboxylic acid prefers to form a directional dimer, which has enabled us to readily construct reticular porous HOF materials whose pores can be systematically tuned. In this Account, we outline our journey of exploring this new type of porous material by establishing one of the first porous HOFs in 2011 and thus developing its diverse applications.

Traditional models, which describe hydrogen bonds as electrostatic interactions between electropositive hydrogen and electronegative acceptors, fail to quantitatively capture bond strength, directionality, or cooperativity, and cannot predict the properties of complex hydrogen-bonded materials. Here, we introduce a novel approach that conceptualizes the effect of hydrogen bonds as elastic dipoles in an electric field, which captures a wide range of hydrogen bonding phenomena in various water systems. Using gypsum, a hydrogen bond heterostructure with two-dimensional structural crystalline water, we calibrate the hydrogen bond strength through an externally applied electric field. We show that our approach quantifies the strength of hydrogen bonds directly from spectroscopic measurements and reproduces a wide range of key properties of confined water reported in the literature. Using only the stretching vibration frequency of confined water, we can predict hydrogen bond strength, local electric field, O-H bond length, and dipole moment.

According to this aim, waste glass powder (WGP) was first used as a partial replacement for cement and six different ratios of WGP were utilized in concrete production: 0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50%. To examine the combined effect of different ratios of WGP on concrete performance, mixed samples (10%, 20%, 30%) were then prepared by replacing cement, and fine and coarse aggregates with both WGP and crashed glass particles. Workability and slump values of concrete produced with different amounts of waste glass were determined on the fresh state of concrete, and these properties were compared with those of plain concrete. For the hardened concrete, 150 mm \u00d7 150 mm \u00d7 150 mm cubic specimens and cylindrical specimens with a diameter of 100 mm and a height of 200 mm were tested to identify the compressive strength and splitting tensile strength of the concrete produced with waste glass. Next, a three-point bending test was carried out on samples with dimensions of 100 \u00d7 100 \u00d7 400 mm, and a span length of 300 mm to obtain the flexure behavior of different mixtures. According to the results obtained, a 20% substitution of WGP as cement can be considered the optimum dose. On the other hand, for concrete produced with combined WGP and crashed glass particles, mechanical properties increased up to a certain limit and then decreased owing to poor workability. Thus, 10% can be considered the optimum replacement level, as combined waste glass shows considerably higher strength and better workability properties. Furthermore, scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis was performed to investigate the microstructure of the composition. Good adhesion was observed between the waste glass and cementitious concrete. Lastly, practical empirical equations have been developed to determine the compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, and flexure strength of concrete with different amounts of waste glass.

Concerns are growing about how to deal with big amounts of this sludge generated globally. One of the ways is to reuse DWTS as a supplementary material in cementitious systems and thus reduce landfill disposals. For our studies, we used DWTS containing more than 52% Fe2O3. The DWTS was taken from a water treatment plant in Vilnius, Lithuania. This work aimed to find potential applications of unprocessed DWTS in cementitious systems as a supplementary material that changes the physical and mechanical properties of the final product. Tests were performed with cementitious mortars where the binder was replaced with DWTS (from 0% to 12.5%). Local raw materials such as Portland cement CEM I 42.5R and sand 0/4 were used in the tests. Water absorption, absorption kinetics, and mechanical strength tests were conducted, and predictive freeze\u2013thaw resistance was estimated. The heat release rate and open\u2013closed porosity were also measured. The results showed that DWTS impacts the hydration of cementitious mortars, lowers their density (from 2122 kg/m3 to 1954 kg/m3), as well as compressive strength (from 41.78 MPa to 24.76 MPa) and flexural strength (from 6.24 MPa to 4.07 MPa), and increases total porosity (from 28.1% to 34.6%) and closed porosity (from 9.1% to 14.9%). The lowest toughness value of 6.08 was recorded in the 12.5% DWTS sample. From our conducted research, it could be observed that raw DWTS potentially changed the porosity parameters of cementitious mortars. This resulted in an incremental improvement in durability and an improvement in the hardness of cementitious mortars. A higher content of raw DWTS changed the colour (to reddish) of cementitious mortars, due to its higher Fe2O3 content (up to 53%).

It is revealed that the adsorption of H is a vital driving force for the leaching of the Cu single atom from the catalyst surface. The more negative the electrode potential, the stronger the adsorption of H. As a result, the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction is inhibited, and Cu-N bonds are weakened, resulting in some Cu atoms being tethered on the catalyst surface and some being dissolved in the aqueous solution.

These toxins display significant sequence and structure diversity, which results in a wide range of specificities for several different ion channels and receptors. Despite the recognized importance of these compounds, our ability to determine their binding targets and toxicities remains a significant challenge. Predicting the target receptors of conotoxins, based solely on their amino acid sequence, remains a challenge due to the intricate relationships between structure, function, target specificity, and the significant conformational heterogeneity observed in conotoxins with the same primary sequence. We have previously demonstrated that the inclusion of post-translational modifications, collisional cross sections values, and other structural features, when added to the standard primary sequence features, improves the prediction accuracy of conotoxins against non-toxic and other toxic peptides across varied datasets and several different commonly used machine learning classifiers. Here, we present the effects of these features on conotoxin class and molecular target predictions, in particular, predicting conotoxins that bind to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). We also demonstrate the use of the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE)-Tomek in balancing the datasets while simultaneously making the different classes more distinct by reducing the number of ambiguous samples which nearly overlap between the classes.

This work integrates theoretical and experimental studies of the effects of metal dissolution from the RuO2 and Ru1\u2013xTixO2 surfaces on the OER activity and electrochemical stability. Our computational analysis shows that the energetic barriers for metal dissolution depend highly on the surface site and Ti-substituent location. Metal dissolution induces the formation of new active surface sites with different electronic density distributions. In addition to dissolution-induced changes to the surface composition, electron density changes occur in the interfacial electrolyte components. Surface reconstruction changes the activation barriers for the OER steps. Our experimental analysis of RuO2 and Ru0.8Ti0.2O2 using a two-step durability test in acidic electrolytes shows that the OER activity, surface, and metal dissolution change over the durability tests. Ti-substitution exhibits improved electrochemical stability with cycling. For RuO2, changes in the mass activity of RuO2 with cycling are directly correlated with Ru dissolution and lowering of the electrochemical surface area (ECSA). In contrast, Ru0.8Ti0.2O2 showed a 19 times lower Ru dissolution rate, and metal dissolution results in increasing the ECSA and new active sites. Our STEM and EELS analysis supports that repeated cycling under OER conditions results in surface reconstruction for both RuO2 and Ru0.8Ti0.2O2, with the formation of a disordered RuO2 surface and changes to the distribution of Ru and Ti at the Ru0.8Ti0.2O2 surface. The experimentally observed changes in activity and surface structure after cycling are consistent with computational analysis, which shows how metal dissolution may alter the OER activation barriers.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that GeoLDM can consistently achieve better performance on multiple molecule generation benchmarks, with up to 7\\% improvement for the valid percentage of large biomolecules. Results also demonstrate GeoLDM's higher capacity for controllable generation thanks to the latent modeling.

This instability primarily originates from the migration of halide ions-particularly iodide ions (I-). Under light exposure and thermal stress, I- migrates and transforms into I2, leading to irreversible degradation and performance loss. To address this issue, we introduced the additive 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole,5,6-difluoro-4,7-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl) (BT2F-2B) into the perovskite. The strong coordination between the unhybridized p orbital and lone-pair electrons from I- inhibits the deprotonation of MAI/FAI and the subsequent conversion of I- to I\u2082. The highly electronegative fluorine enhances its electrostatic interaction with I-. Consequently, the synergistic effect of BT2F-2B effectively suppresses the decomposition of perovskite and the defect density of the iodide vacancies. This approach delivers a PCE over 26% for inverted single-junction PSCs, with exceptional operational stability. According to the ISOS-L-3 testing protocol (maximum power point tracking at 85\u00a0\u00b0C and 50% relative humidity), treated PSCs retain 85% of their original PCE after 1000 h of aging.

Structural, morphological and optoelectronic properties of polymer-modified perovskite films were probed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and UV-Vis spectroscopy. The incorporation of PSI triggers interactions between the polymer and perovskite, leading to the passivation of surface defects at the grain boundaries and improved morphology of perovskite films.

Graphene has recently attracted significant attention as a potential antimicrobial agent because of its low toxicity, ease of production and functionalization, and high solubility in water. The presence of oxygen functional groups allows the interaction of the compound with bacteria and other biomolecules, making it an interesting candidate for antimicrobial therapy. Moreover, integrating graphene into copper coatings has been shown to enhance their antimicrobial properties. However, the implementation of copper\u2013graphene composite coatings is currently limited by the difficulty of uniformly distributing graphene within the copper matrix. Copper (Cu)-doped graphitic nanoplatelets (CuGnPs), one option to overcome this challenge, are made via a mechanochemical reaction between solid graphite and Cu powder. The configuration of C\u2013Cu bonds within CuGnPs can be identified using a range of analytical techniques, including transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry. To evaluate the antibacterial activity of the Cu-GnPs, we employed Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus aureus. Various amounts (250, 500, 750, and 1000 \u03bcg/mL) of prepared CuGnP samples were incubated in a bacterial suspension for 3 or 6 h at 150 rpm and 37 \u00b0C for a colony-forming unit assay. Three hours and six hours of treatment of the bacteria with CuGnPs led to a significant difference in bacterial survival compared with that of the control. It was observed that CuGnPs, with copper bound to graphene oxide, more effectively inhibited the proliferation of E. coli compared with nanoplatelets containing graphene oxide alone.

In this work, a simple and inexpensive two-step synthesis method was proposed to prepare highly stable and well-dispersed spherical CuNPs in solution with a particle size of approximately 37 nm. Synthesis of CuNPs was carried on in the presence of complexing agent trisodium citrate (TSC), while for the chemical reduction step, sodium borohydride (NaBH4) was used. Taking into account the potential of this type of nanoparticles, their synthesis and characterization represent a current and relevant topic in the field. The ability to control the size, shape and properties of CuNPs by adjusting the synthesis parameters (pH, precursor:stabilizer:reductant ratio, homogenization time, temperature) offers extraordinary flexibility in the development of these materials. The combination of characterization techniques such as SEM, EDX, UV\u2013Vis, Raman, FT-IR and AFM provides a thorough understanding of the structure and properties of CuNPs, allowing the modulation of the properties of the obtained nanoparticles in the desired direction. Based on the studies, the copper reduction mechanism was proposed. For the theoretical verification of the size of the experimentally obtained spherical CuNPs, Mie theory was applied. A stability study of the synthesized CuNPs in optimal conditions was performed using UV\u2013Vis analysis at specific time intervals (1, 3, 30 and 60 days), the sample being kept in the dark, inside a drawer at 25 \u00b0C.

The obtained CuNPs demonstrated very good antimicrobial efficacy compared to traditional antimicrobials, for both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. This may reduce the development of antimicrobial resistance, an urgent medical issue.

In this review, the controlled synthesis of CaCO3 is first examined, including Ca2+-CO32- systems, solid-liquid-gas carbonation, water-in-oil reverse emulsions, and biomineralization.

Hierarchical architecture growth mimicking biomineralization has been studied using various organic molecules to template inorganic materials with controlled morphology. In our previous study, self-assembled Sr/CS/G(SrCO3-chitosan-gelatin) aggregates were fabricated using electrophoretic deposition (EPD). This study is a further step toward understanding the morphogenesis of Sr/CS/G aggregates and its biomineralization. Methods Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to investigate the biomimetic morphogenesis of Sr/CS/G composite under various EPD parameters, such as polymer concentration, time, and voltage. The Sr/CS/G aggregates were immersed in H2O, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and simulated body fluid (SBF) to study the bioactive apatite formation ability. In addition, biocompatibility of the composites were evaluated by Fluorescence staining, SEM in vitro. The osteogenic ability of the coatings induced by PBS were tested in vivo. Results The CS/G weight ratio, EPD time, and voltage were found to influence the morphogenesis of Sr/CS/G aggregates. SEM and TEM results showed that the Sr/CS/G aggregates exhibited fractal growth characteristics and morphological self-similarity. XRD results confirmed the formation of SrCO3 crystals within the framework of chitosan and gelatin organic templates. Chitosan played a vital role in branching growth of the crystals, whereas gelatin guided the formation of composite spheres. The microstructural and compositional results reveal that the Sr/CS/G-induced apatite coating yielded a large quantity of apatite. These apatite coatings promote the cytocompatibility and osteogenesis of rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (rBMSCs) in vitro. The coatings induced by PBS enhanced proliferation and mineralization in vitro, and enhanced angiogenesis and osteogenesis in vivo.

In this particular investigation, we synthesized bilayer wound dressings by incorporating snail (Helix aspersa) secretions, comprising mucus and slime, into chitosan matrices via lyophilization and electrospinning methodologies. A nanofiber layer was integrated on top of the porous structure to mimic the epidermal layer for keratinocyte activity as well as acting as an antibacterial barrier against possible infection, whereas a porous structure was designed to mimic the dermal microenvironment for fibroblast activity. Comprehensive assessments encompassing physical characterization, antimicrobial efficacy, in vitro bioactivity, and wound healing potential were conducted on these bilayer dressings.

The literature review was conducted using the PubMed and ScienceDirect databases. Query dates \u2014 may\u2013july 2024, query depth \u2014 1965\u20132024. \nMain content of the review. Effective use of bone polymers for the creation of biomimetic osteoplastic materials is possible only with an understanding of the principles of molecular-cellular interaction of biopolymers with bone cells and tissues. By now, it has been established that the ability of collagen to influence the functional activity of cells involved in the reparative regeneration of bone tissue is due to the presence of special patterns in its structure - binding sites with cellular receptors, which are formed by a specific sequence of amino acids in the collagen polypeptide chain. In the case of inorganic bone material, the functionally significant elements are the chemical composition and crystal structure of calcium phosphate salts. A current trend in the design of osteoplastic materials is to impart biomimetic properties to them. At the molecular level, this approach is implemented using as intrafibrillar and extrafibrillar mineralization of collagen fibrils. At the tissue and organ level, biomimicry is achieved through the use of three-dimensional bioprinting technologies. \nConclusion. Thus, thanks to advances in biology, physics, chemistry and engineering sciences, it was possible to develop new technologies for designing osteoplastic materials that imitate the structure and function of native bone tissue. The use of biomaterials created using biomimetics principles increases the efficiency of bone tissue damage restoration.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2024-11-26", "synthetic_support_claim": "The ability of collagen to influence bone regeneration is due to specific amino acid sequences.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Stem cells are more effective than biomimetic materials for healing critical-sized bone defects."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "b81380d2c8e425812957e9aee06aa4671cd225f9", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b81380d2c8e425812957e9aee06aa4671cd225f9", "title": "Proteins for Hyperelastic Materials.", "abstract": "Meticulous engineering and the yielded hyperelastic performance of structural proteins represent a new frontier in developing next-generation functional biomaterials.

This catalyst requires a small 54\u00a0mV overpotential for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 192\u00a0mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to reach 10 mA\u00b7cm-2 in a 1.0\u00a0m KOH electrolyte. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the incorporation of Ir atoms with enriched interfaces between Ni and Ni2P can promote the active sites and be favorable for the HER and OER.

Using Pt/CeO2 as a model system, we systematically investigate how variations in pulse duration and atmosphere influence the reconstruction of the metal-support interface and MSIs.

The classification of silicified wood as such deals with all the forms and phases of silica that come under its umbrella. One such class of silicified wood is fossil wood with a high content of quartz, and there are very limited mentions of this category of fossilized wood. The examined wood belongs to gymnosperm and comes from the Upper Triassic deposits of Madagascar. A fresh approach to such samples is adopted by studying the crystallographic texture of the fossil wood to understand the orientation of the crystals replacing the organic matter within the sample. This work focuses on crystallographic texture analysis based on pole figures measured by X-ray diffraction. The intensity of the pole density maxima on the pole figures measured on the heartwood surface part of the analyzed samples is higher than that on the sapwood. This affirms that the crystallographic texture is sharper at the heartwood part compared to the sapwood. The X-ray tomography study, conducted to understand the difference in mineral distribution within the sample, reveals a greater X-ray absorbing phase on the sapwood of both samples. This is due to the concentration of iron compounds, which both replace the remaining conductive structures of the wood and fill the cavities inside them.

The stiffness and stretchability of the poly(NIPAm\u2010co\u2010AAc) eutectogels can also be easily modulated by adjusting the AAc content and monomer concentration, leading to highly transparent gels with high toughness. Furthermore, the eutectogels demonstrate efficient dissipation, reasonable recovery, and moderate self\u2010healing capability. The resin is also compatible with digital light processing 3D printing to prepare dielectric layers with different geometric designs for capacitive sensors.

In particular, II-VI semiconductors based on cadmium, zinc, or mercury chalcogenides can now be synthesized with tailored shapes, composition by alloying, and even as nanocrystal heterostructures. Fifteen years ago, II-VI semiconductor nanoplatelets injected new ideas into this field. Indeed, despite the emergence of other promising semiconductors such as halide perovskites or 2D transition metal dichalcogenides, colloidal II-VI semiconductor nanoplatelets remain among the narrowest room-temperature emitters that can be synthesized over a wide spectral range, and they exhibit good material stability over time. Such nanoplatelets are scientifically and technologically interesting because they exhibit optical features and production advantages at the intersection of those expected from colloidal quantum dots and epitaxial quantum wells. In organic solvents, gram-scale syntheses can produce nanoparticles with the same thicknesses and optical properties without inhomogeneous broadening. In such nanoplatelets, quantum confinement is limited to one dimension, defined at the atomic scale, which allows them to be treated as quantum wells. In this review, we discuss the synthetic developments, spectroscopic properties, and applications of such nanoplatelets. Covering growth mechanisms, we explain how a thorough understanding of nanoplatelet growth has enabled the development of nanoplatelets and heterostructured nanoplatelets with multiple emission colors, spatially localized excitations, narrow emission, and high quantum yields over a wide spectral range. Moreover, nanoplatelets, with their large lateral extension and their thin short axis and low dielectric surroundings, can support one or several electron-hole pairs with large exciton binding energies. Thus, we also discuss how the relaxation processes and lifetime of the carriers and excitons are modified in nanoplatelets compared to both spherical quantum dots and epitaxial quantum wells. Finally, we explore how nanoplatelets, with their strong and narrow emission, can be considered as ideal candidates for pure-color light emitting diodes (LEDs), strong gain media for lasers, or for use in luminescent light concentrators.", "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-02-01", "synthetic_support_claim": "Colloidal II-VI semiconductor nanoplatelets remain among the narrowest room-temperature emitters synthesized over a wide spectral range.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Colloidal II-VI semiconductor nanoplatelets are the most efficient material for all optoelectronic applications."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "b1fd5c82982efdc6b773152a6a0954f8f2293545", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b1fd5c82982efdc6b773152a6a0954f8f2293545", "title": "Janus 2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenides: Research Progress, Optical Mechanism and Future Prospects for Optoelectronic Devices", "abstract": "Exploring the extraordinary optoelectronic properties of two\u2010dimensional (2D) materials to construct advanced optoelectronic devices is a major goal for academic researchers and industrialists.

Therefore, this research focused on the effect of the purity of the selected raw materials and of the microstructural porosity of 3D-printed ceramic substrates on the Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) coating efficiency.

A series of ternary and quaternary COFs were synthesized containing the electron-rich linker 2,4,6-triformylphloroglucinol as the electron donor, the electron-deficient linker 4,4\u2032-(thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole-2,5-diyl)dibenzaldehyde as the acceptor, and amidoxime nanotraps for selective uranyl capture (with the quaternary COFs incorporating [2,2\u2032-bipyridine-5,5\u2032-diamine-Ru(Bp)2]Cl2 as a secondary photosensitizer). The ordered porous structure of the quaternary COFs ensured efficient mass transfer during the adsorption-photocatalysis capture of uranium from seawater samples, with photocatalytically generated electrons resulting in the reduction of adsorbed U(VI) to U(IV) in the form of UO2. A quaternary COF, denoted as COF 2-Ru-AO, possessed a high uranium uptake capacity of 2.45 mg/g/day in natural seawater and good anti-biofouling abilities, surpassing most adsorbents thus far.

However, pure ZnO-NPs have several limitations, including a wide energy bandgap, high excitation binding energy, poor photocatalytic activity in the visible range, and significant electron-hole recombination, which restrict their applications. To address these limitations, this study successfully incorporated graphene oxide (GO) into ZnO-NPs. Adding 4% GO reduced the energy band gap from 2.87 eV to 2.20 eV, significantly enhancing their activities. As a result of the integration, their photocatalytic activity enhanced, degrading 98% of methylene blue dye after 80 minutes of visible light exposure. Furthermore, GO incorporation boosted their antioxidant activity, increasing their half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) from 38.38% to 51.60%. The nanocomposite exhibited superior antimicrobial activity compared to the pure ZnO-NPs and GO, indicating enhanced antimicrobial effects through GO integration.

To address the high cost of raw materials for MOFs and the low efficiency of Hg0 removal in low-temperature environments, a series of MIL-101(Cr)-derived carbon matrix composite materials were prepared by combining MIL-101(Cr) with biomass and multiple metals. These materials were synthesized through a sol-gel method followed by carbonization. This study investigates the effects of composite ratios and adsorption temperatures on Hg0 removal, utilizing XRD, BET, and other characterization techniques to elucidate the mercury-removal mechanism of the PDC-MIL composite materials. The results indicate that MIL101(Cr) significantly influences the formation of the gel skeleton. When the composite ratio of MIL-101(Cr) to biomass is 1:1, the material exhibits an optimal pore structure, leading to high Hg0 removal efficiency over a wide temperature range. The removal of Hg0 by these composite materials involves both physical adsorption and chemisorption. Low temperatures favor physical adsorption, while high temperatures promote chemisorption. The sol-gel composite method facilitates cross-linking polymerization between MOFs and SiO2, enabling better pore structure connectivity with biomass and MOFs, thereby optimizing the poor pore structure observed after pyrolysis.

A few recent studies have shown that spatial confinement and mechanical properties of the encapsulating material significantly influence microbial behavior, including growth, metabolism, and gene expression. While such effects have been shown to elicit various responses in a few micro-organisms like E. coli, yeast, and cyanobacteria, systematic comparative studies between different organisms in the same confinement conditions are missing. Thus, in this study, we report the adaptive responses exhibited by rod-shaped gram-negative and gram-positive probiotic bacteria that are of great interest for developing therapeutic engineered living materials. Accordingly, gram-negative E. coli Nissle 1917 and gram-positive L. plantarum WCFS1 were encapsulated in hydrogel matrices and their growth, metabolic activity, and recombinant gene expression were investigated. By varying the polymer concentration and degree of chemical cross-linking in the hydrogels, it was possible to modulate their stiffness and study how the bacteria adapted to these different confinement conditions. In accordance with previous reports, both bacteria grow from single cells into confined colonies but more interestingly, in E. coli gels, mechanical properties influenced colony growth, size, and morphology, whereas this did not occur in L. plantarum gels. However, with both bacteria, increased matrix stiffness led to higher levels of recombinant protein production within the colonies. By measuring metabolic heat generated in the bacterial gels using a novel isothermal microcalorimetry technique, it was inferred that E. coli adapts to the mechanical restrictions through multiple metabolic transitions and is significantly affected by the different hydrogel properties. Contrastingly, both these aspects were not observed with L. plantarum. These results revealed that despite both these bacteria being gut-adapted probiotics with similar geometries, mechanical confinement affects them considerably differently. The weaker influence of matrix stiffness on L. plantarum is attributed to its slower growth and thicker cell wall possibly enabling the generation of higher turgor pressures to overcome restrictive forces under confinement. By providing fundamental insights into the interplay between mechanical forces and bacterial physiology, this work advances our understanding of how matrix properties shape bacterial behavior.

However, optimizing hydrogels with multiple components is challenging because of their complex structure-property relationships. Herein, high-throughput screening of a series of hydrophobic alkyl monomers and adhesive catechol derivatives was used to systematically develop wet adhesive hydrogels. Short alkyl chains promote wet adhesion by repelling water at the adhesive interface, whereas long alkyl chains form strong hydrophobic interactions inside the hydrogel network that impede or dissipate energy for wet adhesion.

The 0.9 eV band gap of A5Al2O4 is narrower than the band gaps of all parent spinel oxides. First-principles calculations for multicomponent AAl2O4 spinels indicate that the band gap narrowing arises from the broadening of the energy distribution of the 3d states due to variations in the electronegativities and crystal field splitting across the 3d transition-metal series. As a catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction in an alkaline electrolyte, A5Al2O4 reaches a current density of 10 mA/cm2 at an overpotential of 400 mV, outperforming all of the single-metal end members at an applied potential of 1.7 V vs RHE. Catalyst deactivation occurs after 5 h at 10 mA/cm2 and is attributed, based on elemental analysis and grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction, to the formation of a passivating layer that blocks the high-entropy oxide surface. This result helps to validate that the HEO is the active catalyst.

The organic outer layer, composed of cross-linked oxidized sodium alginate and polyacrylamide (OSA/PAM), not only serves as a physical barrier to isolate active water but also accelerates Zn2+ diffusion by facilitating the desolvation process of [Zn(H2O)6]2+ due to its plentiful polar functional groups, thereby effectively suppressing the detrimental HER and Zn self-corrosion.

This experimental study used a Complete Randomized Design (CRD) approach. The five stages involved callus induction, elicitation with L-methionine precursor, caffeine extraction, qualitative testing using the Parry Method and quantitative analysis via UV-Vis spectrophotometry. Tools and materials were sterilized using autoclaving and media preparation followed standard procedures with varying L-methionine concentrations.

DNA storage is an innovative approach harnessing DNA and other biomolecules as storage mediums, endowed with superior characteristics including expansive capacity, remarkable density, minimal energy requirements, and unparalleled longevity. Central to the efficient DNA storage is the process of DNA coding, whereby digital information is converted into sequences of DNA bases. A novel encoding method based on adaptive arithmetic coding (AAC) has been introduced, delineating the encoding process into three distinct phases: compression, error correction, and mapping. Prediction by Partial Matching (PPM)-based AAC in the compression phase serves to compress data and enhance storage density. Subsequently, the error correction phase relies on octal Hamming code to rectify errors and safeguard data integrity. The mapping phase employs a \"3-2 code\" mapping relationship to ensure adherence to biochemical constraints. The proposed method was verified by encoding different formats of files such as text, pictures, and audio. The results indicated that the average coding density of bases can be up to 3.25 per nucleotide, the GC content (which includes guanine [G] and cytosine [C]) can be stabilized at 50% and the homopolymer length is restricted to no more than 2.

The aim of this study was to comprehensively assess the mechanical and biocompatibility of the nanocomposite which synthesized by 3D printing method. For this purpose, the Cup powder was initially synthesized through sol-gel process and its confirmation was proved using techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Then, three CMC/Z scaffolds were made with different Cup contents: group A (0\u2009wt.% Cup), group B (2.5\u2009wt.% Cup) and group C (5\u2009wt.% Cup). The scaffolds were well-ordered microporous with a high porosity and pore connectivity, as observed by morphological analysis by SEM. Additionally, the pore size of group B was more homogeneous than that of groups A and C. There were no significance differences in physicochemical characterization among the three groups. Mechanical properties analysis showed that values of compression modulus are significantly increased with addition of 2.5% Cup nanoparticles into CMCS/zein matrix, from 1.2 to 9.6\u2009MPa. The incorporation of Cup nanoparticles into CMCS along with zein can provide a suitable substrate for the growth of osteoblast cells after implantation, as indicated by the results of in\u00a0vitro degradation. The scaffolds were cultured in\u00a0vitro with MG-63 cells, showing that cell viability increased with the Cup content, 95%, 105%, and 110% for the pure polymeric scaffold, and scaffolds reinforced with 2.5% and 5% Cup, respectively.

The sensor shows a high sensing response (Rair/Rgas = 310.1) and an ultrafast response time (less than 1 s) to 20 ppm H2S at an operating temperature of 160 \u00b0C. Operando SR-FTIR spectroscopic characterizations and DFT calculations prove that the superior sensing properties can be mainly attributed to the driven effect of atomic Ru species on the formation of surface-adsorbed oxygen species on the surface of SnO2, which provides more active sites and enhances the sensing performance of SnO2 for H2S. Furthermore, a lab-made wireless portable H2S monitoring system is developed to rapidly detect the H2S for early warning, suggesting the potential application of the fabricated H2S sensor and monitoring system.

The subsequent reaction exothermicity provides local heating; the transport of this thermal energy to neighboring monomers in either a liquid or gel-like state results in a self-perpetuating reaction zone that provides fully cured thermosets and thermoplastics.

Since the proposal of the bulk heterojunction concept by Heeger et al. in 1995, conjugated polymer/fullerene pairs have gradually emerged as the optimal choice for active layer materials in OSCs. Fullerene derivatives were preferred as electron acceptors in OSCs because of their high electron mobility. However, due to limitations such as insufficient light absorption, limited derivative potential, and poor energy level tunability, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs based on fullerene derivatives has encountered a bottleneck of approximately 12%, despite the continuous updates in polymer donor materials over nearly two decades of development, leading to a gradual decline in their importance. By contrast, nonfullerene electron acceptors (NFAs) have gradually gained dominance in this field since first appearing in 2015, thanks to their advantages of tunable absorption spectrum, adjustable energy levels, and modifiable chemical structure. Among nonfullerene acceptors, fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs) such as ITIC and Y6 have achieved significant progress, boosting the PCE of OSCs to 20%. This milestone achievement indicates the potential of their commercial applications. However, the synthesis process of FREA is complex and often constrained by low-yield ring-closure reactions, resulting in high costs.The molecular backbone of nonfused ring electron acceptors (NFREAs) is composed of single bonds, which enables the adoption of modular synthesis mainly via Stille (based on organotin reactant) and/or Suzuki (based on organoboron reactant) coupling or C-H activation (without prefunctionalization) and avoids low-yield ring-closing reactions, thus making them a potential alternative to fused-ring acceptors. To achieve a planar molecular backbone and minimize energy loss due to conformational rotation, our team innovatively used intramolecular noncovalent interactions as a replacement for traditional covalent bonds. Furthermore, to address the issues of poor solubility and excessive aggregation during film formation for NFREAs, we strategically introduced sterically hindered side groups, such as 2,6-bis(alkyloxy)phenyl and diphenylamino, into the molecular design, effectively mitigating these problems. These innovative design concepts have significantly advanced the development of high-performance NFREAs and have garnered increasing attention from the research community. The PCEs of OSCs based on NFREAs have significantly improved from less than 10% to close to 20% since their initial discovery. By optimizing the device fabrication process, we have achieved a PCE of over 19%, which is comparable to that of FREAs.

Unlike fluorescence, it shows a long emission lifetime (\u223c\u03bcs), large Stokes shift, and rich excited state properties, attracting considerable attention in organic electronics during the past years. Ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP), a type of persistent luminescence in organic phosphors, shows an emission lifetime of over 100 ms normally according to the resolution limit of the naked eye. According to the Jablonski energy diagram, two prerequisites are necessary for UOP generation and enhancement. One is to promote intersystem crossing (ISC) of the excitons from the excited singlet to triplet states by enhancing the spin-orbit coupling (SOC); the other is to suppress the nonradiative transitions of the excitons from the excited triplet states.In this Account, we will give a summary of our research on ultralong organic phosphorescence, including the design of materials, manipulation of properties, fabrication of nano/microstructures, and function applications. First, we give a brief introduction to the UOP development. Then, we discuss the constructed methods of UOP materials from the inter/intramolecular interaction types, including \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions, intermolecular hydrogen bonds, halogen bonds, ionic bonds, covalent bonds, and so on. These effective interactions can build a rigid environment to restrain the nonradiative transitions from the molecular motions or external quenching by oxygen, moisture, or heat, and thus enhance the UOP performance. Next, the manipulation of UOP properties, containing excitation wavelength, emission colors, lifetimes, and quantum efficiency (QE), through molecular or crystal engineering will be summarized. Recently, the excitation wavelengths of the materials for UOP can be regulated in different regions, such as UV, visible light, and X-ray; the emission colors of UOP can cover the whole visible-light region, from deep blue to red; the phosphorescence lifetime of UOP materials can reach 2.5 s, and the quantum efficiency can be achieved up to 96.5%. Moreover, we will present the fabrication of micro/nanoscale UOP materials, including the preparation of micro/nanostructure, optical performance, and device fabrication.

By the assembly of short nanofibers containing dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG)-loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles with a 3D printed strontium-contained hydroxyapatite/polycaprolactone (SrHA@PCL) scaffold, an adjustable porous structure can be easily realized by changing the density of nanofibers, while strong compressive strength will be acquired due to the framework role of SrHA@PCL.

Free electrons on the surface can reduce palladium precursors in situ, leading to the deposition of fine Pd nanoparticles on alumina. The produced Pd nanocatalysts are highly effective in the selective hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanone, achieving a high catalytic performance under mild conditions (30 \u00b0C and 0.1 MPa of H2). Systematic mechanism investigations reveal that hydroxyl radicals generated at the catalyst interfaces facilitate the activation of phenol. The activated phenol is then sequentially hydrogenated to give the intermediate 2-cyclohexenone and then the desired cyclohexanone. The catalyst system demonstrates efficacy in selectively hydrogenating substituted phenols into a wide array of functional ketones.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-11-12", "synthetic_support_claim": "F-center enriched alumina can facilitate the deposition of Pd nanoparticles and selectively hydrogenate phenol.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Electronic defects in nonreducible oxides significantly improve their catalytic properties in diverse chemical reactions."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "5abbd085520af78b84ec98eb50e050c194632c8e", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5abbd085520af78b84ec98eb50e050c194632c8e", "title": "Digital Descriptors in Predicting Catalysis Reaction Efficiency and Selectivity.", "abstract": "Accurately controlling the interactions and dynamic changes between multiple active sites (e.g., metals, vacancies, and lone pairs of heteroatoms) to achieve efficient catalytic performance is a key issue and challenge in the design of complex catalytic reactions involving 2D metal-supported catalysts, metal-zeolites, metal-organic catalysts, and metalloenzymes.

Description Editor\u2019s summary Certain fluoropolymers have ferroelectric properties and attractive mechanical properties for a wide range of applications. Qian et al. review the history of these polymers and discuss recent progress, focusing on their potential use in electromechanical, electrocaloric, and dielectric applications. Fluoropolymers are relatively flexible, making these materials attractive for a wide range of applications, including wearable devices. Many challenges remain for improving the properties of these materials for commercial applications. \u2014Brent Grocholski A review explains that polymer ferroelectrics are attractive materials for electromechanical, electrocaloric, and dielectric applications. BACKGROUND Polymeric ferroelectrics are distinguished by their high pliability, easy fabrication into complicated shapes, mechanical robustness, and polar active nature. Ferroelectricity in polymers was discovered around the 1970s in poly(vinylidene fluoride), which has served as a platform for efficient cross-coupling between electrical, mechanical, and thermal energies. Such ferroelectric soft materials and their polar active derivatives undergo a change in electrical polarization in response to general forces (mechanical stresses or temperature changes) and vice versa, enabling a series of physical effects, including piezoelectric and electrostriction, electrocaloric and pyroelectric, and a variety of dielectric and ferroelectric effects. These multifunctional polymeric materials are suitable for many different applications in portable, miniaturized, and wearable electroactive devices applied at human\u2013machine interfaces because of their easy processability into thin, light, tough, and pliable films and fibers. ADVANCES Polymer ferroelectrics have exhibited marked improvements in electromechanical coupling efficiency, electrostrictive strain, electrocaloric heat-pumping capability, and lifetime, which have substantially boosted the development of practical applications based on these polar soft materials owing to the facile application of defects in tuning and controlling the polarization processes at the monomeric, macromolecular, and morphological structure levels. For the first time, the piezoelectric and electromechanical coupling factors of fluorinated alkyne (FA)\u2013modified relaxor ferroelectric tetrapolymers have surpassed those of lead zirconate titanate (PZT) piezoceramics, the presently most widely used piezoceramics in the world. Coupled with the progressive 4% electrostrictive strain under a low electrical field of 50 MV/m, this advancement represents a step forward in developing efficient wearable sensory and haptic devices and soft robots. Additionally, advances in ferroelectric-based electrocaloric polymers have led to large electrocaloric cooling of >7.5 K under ultralow electric fields without fatigue. These ferroelectric polymers can offer customized, energy-efficient solutions to curb the CO2 emissions of current commercial heat pumps, air conditioners (ACs), and refrigerators, which are responsible for 60% of building emissions. In addition, the most recently reported electroactive fabrics demonstrate versatile strategies for integrating these polymer ferroelectrics at human\u2013machine interfaces in this envisioned low-carbon society. OUTLOOK Understanding and then tailor-making the structures and polarization responses of polymeric ferroelectrics to obtain respective functionalities are critical for the development of these polymeric systems. Given their rich underlying chemistry, FA-modified relaxor ferroelectric polymers are likely still in their infancy. Defect modifications on the molecular scale provide a plethora of methods to manipulate the polar structures and field-induced phase transitions on demand. Considering the vast pool of monomers and nanoscale extrinsic inclusions that can be selected, defect modification in polymer ferroelectrics remains largely unexplored and holds great possibility for contributing to green, smart, and meta lifestyles. Further identifying and understanding the various polarization mechanisms and processes for each functionality at multiple scales will be accomplished by utilizing the current advanced, in situ characterization and simulation tools at our disposal. For different cross-couplings and correlated applications, materials should be fine-tuned to exhibit their respective collection of optimized properties. Several mutual challenges should be addressed, including realizing low-field operation, a long lifetime, viable strategies for integration and mass production, and so on. Considering the commercially available processes for polymeric films, multilayer capacitors, fibers, and fabrics, these flexible ferroelectrics are expected to play a key role in haptic, sensory, and robotic applications in the metaverse, serve as a solid-state refrigerant for flat-panel and/or wearable ACs, and provide a broad range of localized, bodily sensations and tactile effects currently unavailable on the market.

Therefore, further promoting the specific energy of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is an inevitable need, where the development of cathode materials with high energy densities, i.e. high specific capacity and/or high working voltage, is essential. Accordingly, numerous research efforts are ongoing worldwide, where several materials stand out, including LiCoO2 (LCO), Ni-rich oxides and Li-rich cathodes, mainly because of their potential to deliver high capacities when operating at high voltages.

Consequently, understanding the failure mechanism of anionic redox chemistry and finding solutions to this issue are crucial for realizing the practical application of these high-voltage materials. Although many studies have been reported on the anionic redox chemistry of different materials, the corresponding reviews have predominantly focused on Li-rich cathode materials. Hence, the reviews on high-voltage LCO and Ni-rich oxides remain incomplete, and a unified understanding of their behavior at high voltages has not been established yet.

In this review, we highlight major acidic polymers and their engineered morphologies and optimized properties, including metal selectivity and water permeation or retention. Crucial phenomena, such as self-assembly in acid-group-functionalized polymers for driving water transportation, are discussed. It was observed that the phosphonic acid groups containing polymers are rather suitable for the selective adsorption of toxic metals, and thus, are superior to their sulfonated counterparts. Additionally, due to their amphoteric nature, phosphonated polymers displayed several modes of metal complexations, which makes them appropriate for eliminating a wide range of metals. Further observation indicates that aromatic-acid-functionalized polymers are more durable.

Recognized as one of the most widely utilized metal additive manufacturing (AM) techniques, DED has found extensive applications in critical industrial sectors such as aerospace and aviation. Despite its potential, challenges such as inconsistent part quality and low process repeatability continue to restrict its broader adoption. The core issue underlying these challenges is the complex, dynamic nature of the DED process, which involves the coupling of multiple physical fields. Within this context, the molten pool plays a pivotal role, serving as a key carrier that encapsulates abundant process characteristic information. The dynamic characteristics of the molten pool are intrinsically linked to the final part quality and the repeatability of the process. Consequently, integrating machine learning (ML) methodologies into the monitoring framework can offer robust data-driven support for enhancing both product quality and process consistency.

The ferroelectric polarization, however, is generally accompanied by some intrinsic defects, particularly oxygen vacancies, whose impact upon photocatalysis is far from being fully understood and modulated. Here, we have studied the role of oxygen vacancies over the photocatalytic behavior of single-domain PbTiO3 through a combination of theoretical and experimental viewpoints. Our results indicate that the oxygen vacancies in the negatively polarized facet (001) are active sites for water oxidation into O2, while the defect-free sites prefer H2O2 as the oxidation product. The apparent quantum yield at 435 nm for photocatalytic overall water splitting with PbTiO3/Rh/Cr2O3 is determined to be 0.025%, which is remarkable for single undoped metal oxide-based photocatalysts. Furthermore, the strong correlation among oxygen vacancies, polarization strength, and photocatalytic activity is properly reflected by charge separation conditions in the single-domain PbTiO3.

The characteristics (compressive strength and peak strain) of RRAC with various amounts of RA and RPs after heating at various temperatures were studied in this work. The results show that high temperatures significantly decreased the uniaxial compressive strength (UCS), whereas the addition of RA (e.g., 50%) and RPs (e.g., 5%) can mitigate the negative effect caused by high temperatures. The peak strain can also be improved by increasing the replacement ratios of RA and RP. Support vector regression (SVR) models were trained using a total of 120 groups of UCS and peak strain experimental datasets, and an SVR-based multi-objective optimization model was proposed. The excellent correlation coefficients (0.9772 for UCS and 0.9412 for peak strain) found to illustrate the remarkable accuracy of the SVR models. The Pareto fronts of a tri-objective mixture optimization design (UCS, strain, and cost) were successfully generated as the decision reference at varying temperature conditions. A sensitivity analysis was performed to rank the importance of the input variables where temperature was found as the most important one.

PDP confirmed that the inhibitor works as a mixed-type inhibitor with cathodic supremacy. EIS revealed that the charge transfer mechanism is the main controlling factor for the corrosion process. The thermodynamic parameters suggested a key role of OML physisorption in inhibition, following the Langmuir isotherm. Importantly, SEM and EDX analyses suggested the formation of a protective layer of the extract onto the steel surface, which shields the surface from corrosive species. This is owed to the functional group-rich phytochemicals of OML. Therefore, the development of bio-based corrosion inhibitors is not only a step towards more eco-friendly industrial practices, but also meets the growing demand for sustainable materials in a world with constrained resources.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-01-01", "synthetic_support_claim": "Marjoram essential oil inhibits mild steel corrosion in 1 M HCl, achieving 87.1% efficiency at 500 ppm.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "OML improves the mechanical properties of mild steel besides its anti-corrosive capabilities in acidic environments."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "204b08a99198ab9914a105c42d498863283515b4", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/204b08a99198ab9914a105c42d498863283515b4", "title": "Chitosan-Based Biomaterials for Bone Tissue Engineering Applications: A Short Review", "abstract": "Natural bone tissue is composed of calcium-deficient carbonated hydroxyapatite as the inorganic phase and collagen type I as the main organic phase.

This study aimed to compare the influences of particle size and sintering temperature on the mechanical properties and biocompatibility of calcium phosphate (CaP) gyroid scaffolds. CaP gyroid scaffolds were fabricated by 3D printing using powders with the same chemical composition but different particle sizes and sintering temperatures. The physicochemical characterization of the scaffolds was performed using X-ray diffractometry, scanning electron microscopy, and microtomography analyses. The immortalized human mesenchymal stem cell line SCP-1 (osteoblast-like cells) and osteoclast-like cells (THP-1 cells) were seeded on the scaffolds as mono- or co-cultures. Bone cell attachment, number of live cells, and functionality were assessed at different time points over a period of 21 days. Improvements in mechanical properties were observed for scaffolds fabricated with narrow-particle-size-distribution powder. The physicochemical analysis showed that the microstructure varied with sintering temperature and that narrow particle size distribution resulted in smaller micropores and a smoother surface. Viable osteoblast- and osteoclast-like cells were observed for all scaffolds tested, but scaffolds produced with a smaller particle size distribution showed less attachment of osteoblast-like cells. Interestingly, low attachment of osteoclast-like cells was observed for all scaffolds regardless of surface roughness.

While current devices use a single type of dynamic polymer for all functional layers to ensure strong interlayer adhesion, this approach requires manual layer alignment. In this study, we used two dynamic polymers, which have immiscible backbones but identical dynamic bonds, to maintain interlayer adhesion while enabling autonomous realignment during healing. These dynamic polymers exhibit a weakly interpenetrating and adhesive interface, whose width is tunable. When multilayered polymer films are misaligned after damage, these structures autonomously realign during healing to minimize interfacial free energy. We fabricated devices with conductive, dielectric, and magnetic particles that functionally heal after damage, enabling thin-film pressure sensors, magnetically assembled soft robots, and underwater circuit assembly.
