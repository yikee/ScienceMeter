By combining structural context and evolutionary conservation, our model achieves state-of-the-art results across a wide range of genetic and experimental benchmarks, all without explicitly training on such data.

Description Editor\u2019s summary Single\u2013amino acid changes in proteins sometimes have little effect but can often lead to problems in protein folding, activity, or stability. Only a small fraction of variants have been experimentally investigated, but there are vast amounts of biological sequence data that are suitable for use as training data for machine learning approaches. Cheng et al. developed AlphaMissense, a deep learning model that builds on the protein structure prediction tool AlphaFold2 (see the Perspective by Marsh and Teichmann). The model is trained on population frequency data and uses sequence and predicted structural context, all of which contribute to its performance. The authors evaluated the model against related methods using clinical databases not included in the training and demonstrated agreement with multiplexed assays of variant effect. Predictions for all single\u2013amino acid substitutions in the human proteome are provided as a community resource. \u2014Michael A. Funk AlphaFold fine-tuned on human and primate population variant frequency databases predicts variant pathogenicity. INTRODUCTION Genome sequencing has revealed extensive genetic variation in human populations. Missense variants are genetic variants that alter the amino acid sequence of proteins. Pathogenic missense variants disrupt protein function and reduce organismal fitness, while benign missense variants have limited effect. RATIONALE Classifying these variants is an important ongoing challenge in human genetics. Of more than 4 million observed missense variants, only an estimated 2% have been clinically classified as pathogenic or benign, while the vast majority of them are of unknown clinical significance. This limits the diagnosis of rare diseases, as well as the development or application of clinical treatments that target the underlying genetic cause. Machine learning approaches could close the variant interpretation gap by exploiting patterns in biological data to predict the pathogenicity of unannotated variants. Specifically, AlphaFold, which accurately predicts protein structure from protein sequence, may be used as a foundation to predict the pathogenicity of variants on proteins. RESULTS We developed AlphaMissense to leverage advances on multiple fronts: (i) unsupervised protein language modeling to learn amino acid distributions conditioned on sequence context; (ii) incorporating structural context by using an AlphaFold-derived system; and (iii) fine-tuning on weak labels from population frequency data, thereby avoiding bias from human-curated annotations. AlphaMissense achieves state-of-the-art missense pathogenicity predictions in clinical annotation, de novo disease variants, and experimental assay benchmarks without explicitly training on such data. As a resource to the community, we provide a database of predictions for all possible single amino acid substitutions in the human proteome. We classify 32% of all missense variants as likely pathogenic and 57% as likely benign using a cutoff yielding 90% precision on the ClinVar dataset, thereby providing a confident prediction for most human missense variants. We show how this resource can be used to accelerate research in multiple fields. Molecular biologists could use the database as a starting point for designing and interpreting experiments that probe saturating amino acid substitutions across the human proteome. Human geneticists could combine gene-level AlphaMissense predictions with population cohort\u2013based approaches to quantify the functional significance of genes, especially for shorter human genes where cohort-based approaches lack statistical power. Finally, clinicians could benefit from the boost in coverage of confidently classified pathogenic variants when prioritizing de novo variants for rare disease diagnostics, and AlphaMissense predictions could inform studies of complex trait genetics that use annotations of rare, likely deleterious variants. CONCLUSION AlphaMissense predictions may illuminate the molecular effects of variants on protein function, contribute to the identification of pathogenic missense mutations and previously unknown disease-causing genes, and increase the diagnostic yield of rare genetic diseases. AlphaMissense will also foster further development of specialized protein variant effect predictors from structure prediction models. AlphaMissense pathogenicity prediction. AlphaMissense takes as input a missense variant and predicts its pathogenicity. We fine-tuned AlphaFold on human and primate variant population frequency data and calibrated the confidence on known disease variants. AlphaMissense predicts the probability of a missense variant being pathogenic and classifies it as either likely benign, likely pathogenic, or uncertain.

Currently, the functional meaning of the SASH1-Sam1/EphA2-Sam complex is unknown, but EphA2 is a well-established and crucial player in cancer onset and progression. Thus, herein, to investigate a possible correlation between the formation of the SASH1-Sam1/EphA2-Sam complex and EphA2 activity in cancer, cancer-linked mutations in SASH1-Sam1 were deeply analyzed.

Long non\u2010coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are non\u2010protein\u2010coding transcripts >\u2009500 nucleotides with diverse regulatory functions; their role in epidermal dysfunction in psoriasis is poorly understood. To identify epidermal transcripts with potential roles in psoriasis, including lncRNAs, we performed RNA sequencing on keratinocytes from psoriasis and healthy skin. We identified 889 differentially expressed lncRNAs, many of which with yet unknown functions. RP11\u2010295G20.2 was identified as a lncRNA significantly induced in psoriasis keratinocytes, and this was verified by qRT\u2010PCR and by single\u2010molecule in situ hybridisation. Analysis of subcellular fractions of epidermis revealed a cytoplasmic localisation in line with results of single molecule in situ hybridisation. We report that RP11\u2010295G20.2 has a skin\u2010enriched expression, and within skin it is mainly expressed in suprabasal epidermal layers. Moreover, RP11\u2010295G20.2 is induced by the key psoriasis cytokine IL\u201017A and shows a dynamic regulation during keratinocyte differentiation with upregulation during early differentiation and downregulation in the late stage.

Wang and Doudna now review the origins and utility of CRISPR-based genome editing, the successes and current limitations of the technology, and where innovation and engineering are needed. The authors describe important advances in the development of CRISPR genome-editing technology and make predictions about where the field is headed. They also highlight specific examples in medicine and agriculture that show how CRISPR is already affecting society, with exciting opportunities for the future. \u2014DJ A review discusses the current state of CRISPR-mediated genetic manipulation in human cells, animals, and plants and considers its future potential. BACKGROUND The fields of molecular biology, genetics, and genomics are at a critical juncture\u2014a moment in history when a convergence of knowledge and methods has made it both technically possible and incredibly useful to edit specific base pairs or segments of DNA in cells and living organisms. The advent of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) genome editing, coupled with advances in computing and imaging capabilities, has initiated a new era in which we can not only diagnose human diseases and even predict individual susceptibility based on personal genetics but also act on that information. Likewise, we can both identify and rapidly alter genes responsible for plant traits, transforming the pace of agricultural research and plant breeding. The applications of this technology convergence are profound and far reaching\u2014and they are happening now. In the decade since the publication of CRISPR-Cas9 as a genome editing technology, the CRISPR toolbox and its applications have profoundly changed biological research, impacting not only patients with genetic diseases but also agricultural practices and products. As a specific example from the field of genomic medicine, it has become feasible to obtain a complete sequence of the human genome in less than 24 hours\u2014a staggering advance considering the first such sequence took 5 years to generate. Notably, designing and putting to use a potent CRISPR genome editor to obtain clinically actionable information from that genome\u2014previously a near-intractable challenge\u2014now takes only a matter of days. For additional background and related topics, we refer readers to in-depth reviews of the microbiology and structural biology of CRISPR systems and to articles about the considerable ethical and societal challenges of this technology. ADVANCES The past decade has witnessed the discovery, engineering, and deployment of RNA-programmed genome editors across many applications. By leveraging CRISPR-Cas9\u2019s most fundamental activity to create a targeted genetic disruption in a gene or gene regulatory element, scientists have built successful platforms for the rapid creation of knockout mice and other animal models, genetic screening, and multiplexed editing. Beyond traditional CRISPR-Cas9\u2013induced knockouts, base editing\u2014a technology utilizing engineered Cas9\u2019s fused to enzymes that alter the chemical nature of DNA bases\u2014has also provided a highly useful strategy to generate site-specific and precise point mutations. Over the past decade, scientists have utilized CRISPR technology as a readily adaptable tool to probe biological function, dissect genetic interactions, and inform strategies to combat human diseases and engineer crops. This Review covers the origins and successes of CRISPR-based genome editing and discusses the most pressing challenges, which include improving editing accuracy and precision, implementing strategies for precise programmable genetic sequence insertions, improving targeted delivery of CRISPR editors, and increasing access and affordability. We examine current efforts addressing these challenges, including emerging gene insertion technologies and new delivery modalities, and describe where further innovation and engineering are needed. CRISPR genome editors are already being deployed in medicine and agriculture, and this Review highlights key examples, including a CRISPR-based therapy treating sickle cell disease, a more nutritious CRISPR-edited tomato, and a high-yield, disease-resistant CRISPR-edited wheat, to illustrate CRISPR\u2019s current and potential future impacts in society. OUTLOOK In the decade ahead, genome editing research and applications will continue to expand and will intersect with advances in technologies, such as machine learning, live cell imaging, and sequencing. A combination of discovery and engineering will diversify and refine the CRISPR toolbox to combat current challenges and enable more wide-ranging applications in both fundamental and applied research. Just as during the advent of CRISPR genome editing, a combination of scientific curiosity and the desire to benefit society will drive the next decade of innovation in CRISPR technology. CRISPR: past, present, and future. The past decade of CRISPR technology has focused on building the platforms for generating gene knockouts, creating knockout mice and other animal models, genetic screening, and multiplexed editing.

Comprehensive efforts and alternative strategies to combat AMR are urgently needed to prevent social, medical, and economic consequences. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a pathogen responsible for a wide range of infections, from soft tissue infections to life-threatening conditions such as bacteremia and pneumonia. Bacteriophages have been considered as a potential therapeutic option to treat bacterial infections. Our aim was to isolate phages able to infect MDR P. aeruginosa strains. Methods: We isolated two lytic phages, using the conventional double layer agar technique (DLA), from samples obtained from the influent of a wastewater treatment plant in Concepci\u00f3n, Chile. The phages, designated as PaCCP1 and PaCCP2, were observed by electron microscopy and their host range was determined against multiple P. aeruginosa strains using DLA. Moreover, their genomes were sequenced and analyzed. Results: Phage PaCCP1 is a member of the Septimatrevirus genus and phage PaCCP2 is a member of the Pbunavirus genus. Both phages are tailed and contain dsDNA. The genome of PaCCP1 is 43,176 bp in length with a GC content of 54.4%, encoding 59 ORFs, one of them being a tRNA gene. The genome of PaCCP2 is 66,333 bp in length with a GC content of 55.6%, encoding 102 non-tRNA ORFs. PaCCP1 is capable of infecting five strains of P. aeruginosa, whereas phage PaCCP2 is capable of infecting three strains of P. aeruginosa.

KTx rejection poses a significant threat to allograft function and longevity of the kidney graft. The relationship between senescence and rejection remains elusive and controversial. Methods Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) provided microarray and single-cell RNA sequencing datasets. After integrating Senescence-Related Genes (SRGs) from multiple established databases, differential expression analysis, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), and machine learning algorithms were applied to identify predictive SRGs (pSRGs). A cluster analysis of rejection samples was conducted using the consensus clustering algorithm. Subsequently, we utilized multiple machine learning methods (RF, SVM, XGB, GLM and LASSO) based on pSRGs to develop the optimal Acute Rejection (AR) diagnostic model and long-term graft survival predictive signatures. Finally, we validated the role of pSRGs and senescence in kidney rejection through the single-cell landscape. Results Thirteen pSRGs were identified, correlating with rejection. Two rejection clusters were divided (Cluster C1 and C2). GSVA analysis of two clusters underscored a positive correlation between senescence, KTx rejection occurrence and worse graft survival. A non-invasive diagnostic model (AUC = 0.975) and a prognostic model (1- Year AUC = 0.881; 2- Year AUC = 0.880; 3- Year AUC = 0.883) for graft survival were developed, demonstrating significant predictive capabilities to early detect acute rejection and long-term graft outcomes. Single-cell sequencing analysis provided a detailed cellular-level landscape of rejection, supporting the conclusions drawn from above.

Often, a gene impact on disease through its altered network within specific cell types, rather than mere changes in expression levels. To explore the cell type-specific roles of disease genes, we developed HCNetlas (human cell network atlas), a resource cataloging cell type-specific gene networks (CGNs) for various healthy tissue cells. We also devised 3 network analysis methods to investigate cell type-specific functions of disease genes.

Two OSCs genes encoding parkeol synthase and lanostadienol synthase have been found in representatives of the genera Apostichopus and Stichopus (family Stichopodidae, order Synallactida). As a limited number of sea cucumber OSCs have been studied thus far, OSCs encoding gene(s) of the sea cucumber Eupentacta fraudatrix (family Sclerodactylidae, order Dendrochirotida) were investigated to fill this gap. Here, we employed RACEs, molecular cloning, and Oxford Nanopore Technologies to identify candidate OSC mRNAs and genes.

These siRNAs are loaded onto the programmable nuclease Argonaute-2 (AGO2), with one strand serving as a guide to target and cleave fully complementary sequences of viral RNAs. While siRNAs are generated from viral dsRNA, the specific viral RNA species targeted for silencing during RNA virus replication remains unclear. In this study, we characterized the primary viral RNA targets of the Drosophila siRNA pathway during infections caused by negative and positive RNA viruses, namely Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and Sindbis virus (SINV). Our findings reveal that polyadenylated transcripts of VSV and SINV are the major targets of silencing by the siRNA pathway during infection, likely when they are poised for translation.

Mendelian randomization (MR) has proven valuable for drug repurposing and identifying new therapeutic targets. This study aims to pinpoint novel treatment targets for SNHL, exploring their pathophysiological roles and potential adverse effects. Methods: This research utilized the UKB-PPP database to access cis-protein quantitative trait locus (cis-pQTL) data, with SNHL data sourced from the FinnGen database as the endpoint for the MR causal analysis of drug targets. Colocalization analysis was employed to determine whether SNHL risk and protein expression share common SNPs. A phenotype-wide association analysis was conducted to assess the potential side effects of these targets. Drug prediction and molecular docking were subsequently used to evaluate the therapeutic potential of the identified targets. Results: Four drug target proteins significantly associated with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) were determined by Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis and co-localization analysis. These drug targets include LATS1, TEF, LMNB2, and OGFR and were shown to have fewer potential side effects when acting on these target proteins by phenotype-wide association analysis. Genes associated with sensorineural hearing loss are primarily implicated in the Hippo signaling pathway, cell\u2013cell adhesion, and various binding regulatory activities and are involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis.

Characterization using a polyphasic taxonomic approach, whole-genome sequencing and phylogenomic analyses revealed a close genetic relationship among two strains from Mars 2020 cleanroom floors (179-C4-2-HS, 179-J1A1-HS), one strain from the Agave plant (AT2.8), and another strain from wheat-associated soil (V4I25). All four strains exhibited high 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity (>99.2%) and low average nucleotide identity (ANI) with Neobacillus niacini NBRC 15566T, delineating new phylogenetic branches within the genus. Detailed molecular analyses, including gyrB (90.2%), ANI (86.4%), average amino acid identity (87.8%) phylogenies, digital DNA\u2013DNA hybridization (32.6%), and percentage of conserved proteins (77.7%) indicated significant divergence from N. niacini NBRC 15566T. Consequently, these strains have been designated Neobacillus driksii sp. nov., with the type strain 179-C4-2-HST (DSM 115941T = NRRL B-65665T). N. driksii grew at 4\u00b0C to 45\u00b0C, pH range of 6.0 to 9.5, and 0.5% to 5% NaCl. The major cellular fatty acids are iso-C15:0 and anteiso-C15:0. The dominant polar lipids include diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, and an unidentified aminolipid. Metagenomic analysis within NASA cleanrooms revealed that N. driksii is scarce (17 out of 236 samples). Genes encoding the biosynthesis pathway for lasso peptides were identified in all N. driksii strains and are not commonly found in other Neobacillus species, except in 7 out of 26 recognized species. This study highlights the unique metabolic capabilities of N. driksii, underscoring their potential in antimicrobial research and biotechnology. IMPORTANCE The microbial surveillance of the Mars 2020 assembly cleanroom led to the isolation of novel N. driksii with potential applications in cleanroom environments, such as hospitals, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and aeronautical industries. N. driksii genomes were found to possess genes responsible for producing lasso peptides, which are crucial for antimicrobial defense, communication, and enzyme inhibition. Isolation of N. driksii from cleanrooms, Agave plants, and dryland wheat soils, suggested niche-specific ecology and resilience under various environmentally challenging conditions. The discovery of potent antimicrobial agents from novel N. driksii underscores the importance of genome mining and the isolation of rare microorganisms. Bioactive gene clusters potentially producing nicotianamine-like siderophores were found in N. driksii genomes.

This study aimed to identify virulent genes correlated with the severity of A. flavus keratitis using whole-genome sequencing. Methods Whole-genome sequencing of 21 clinical A. flavus strains from cornea was performed to elucidate the pathogenesis of A. flavus in infectious keratitis, followed by pan-genome analysis and virulence analysis. To further understand the results from the previous analyses, growth phenotypes and virulence effect of mutant strains were validated experimentally, including the spore counting, growth pattern under different conditions, and clinical and pathological evaluation of A. flavus keratitis in mice models. Results The A. flavus pan-genome was composed of 17,326 gene clusters with a core genome of 5378 (31.0% of the pan-genome) orthogroups in all 21 isolates. Virulence gene analysis revealed 183 genes contributing to A. flavus pathogenesis and mutation of the kexB gene was associated with the severity of keratitis. The kexB mutant (\u0394kexB) strains showed significantly reduced conidia formation and lower growth rates in the presence of the cell-wall perturbing agents. Further, the mice models validated that clinical score, and corneal perforation rates significantly decreased in the group infected by \u0394kexB strains.

Among different forms of RCD, ferroptosis is considered as a type of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent regulated necrosis. ROS can react with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) of the lipid (L) membrane via the formation of a lipid radical L\u2022 and induce lipid peroxidation to form L-ROS. Ferroptosis is triggered by an imbalance between lipid hydroperoxide (LOOH) detoxification and iron-dependent L-ROS accumulation. Intracellular iron accumulation and lipid peroxidation are two central biochemical events leading to ferroptosis. Organelles, including mitochondria and lysosomes are involved in the regulation of iron metabolism and redox imbalance in ferroptosis. In this review, we will provide an overview of lipid peroxidation, as well as key components involved in the ferroptotic cascade. The main mechanism that reduces ROS is the redox ability of glutathione (GSH). GSH, a tripeptide that includes glutamic acid, cysteine, and glycine, acts as an antioxidant and is the substrate of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), which is then converted into oxidized glutathione (GSSG). Increasing the expression of GSH can inhibit ferroptosis. We highlight the role of the xc- GSH-GPX4 pathway as the main pathway to regulate ferroptosis. The system xc-, composed of subunit solute carrier family members (SLC7A11 and SLC3A2), mediates the exchange of cystine and glutamate across the plasma membrane to synthesize GSH. Accumulating evidence indicates that ferroptosis requires the autophagy machinery for its execution. Ferritinophagy is used to describe the removal of the major iron storage protein ferritin by the autophagy machinery. Nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4) is a cytosolic autophagy receptor used to bind ferritin for subsequent degradation by ferritinophagy. During ferritinophagy, stored iron released becomes available for biosynthetic pathways. The dysfunctional ferroptotic response is implicated in a variety of pathological conditions. Ferroptosis inducers or inhibitors targeting redox- or iron metabolism-related proteins and signal transduction have been developed. The simultaneous detection of intracellular and extracellular markers may help diagnose and treat diseases related to ferroptotic damage.", "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-12-27", "synthetic_support_claim": "The xc- GSH-GPX4 pathway is the main pathway to regulate ferroptosis.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Ferroptosis aids in cancer cell proliferation by enhancing oxidative stress and promoting tumor growth."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "756811aae86f6d3003951afbac4f0dd2d5a6f17b", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/756811aae86f6d3003951afbac4f0dd2d5a6f17b", "title": "Rbbp6-Mediated Bmal1 Ubiquitination Inhibits YAP1 Signaling Pathway to Promote Ferroptosis in Diabetes-Induced Testicular Damage.", "abstract": "Background\nDiabetes-induced testicular damage (DITD) is a common complication of diabetes.

To better understand the functional diversity of PETs, we characterized three canonical mobile colistin resistance (mcr) alleles (mcr-1, -3, -9), one intrinsic pet (eptA), and two mcr-like genes (petB, petC) in Escherichia coli. Using an isogenic expression system, we show that mcr-1 and mcr-3 confer similar phenotypes of decreased colistin susceptibility with low fitness costs. mcr-9, which is phylogenetically closely related to mcr-3, and eptA only provide fitness advantages in the presence of sub-inhibitory concentrations of colistin and significantly reduce fitness in media without colistin. PET-B and PET-C were phenotypically distinct from bonafide PETs; neither impacted colistin susceptibility nor caused considerable fitness cost. Strikingly, we found for the first time that different PETs selectively modify different phosphates of lipid A; MCR-1, MCR-3, and PET-C selectively modify the 4\u2032-phosphate, whereas MCR-9 and EptA modify the 1-phosphate. However, 4\u2032-phosphate modifications facilitated by MCR-1 and -3 are associated with lowered colistin susceptibility and low toxicity. Our results suggest that PETs have a wide phenotypic diversity and that increased colistin resistance is associated with specific lipid A modification patterns that have been largely unexplored thus far. IMPORTANCE Rising levels of resistance to increasing numbers of antimicrobials have led to the revival of last resort antibiotic colistin. Unfortunately, resistance to colistin is also spreading in the form of mcr genes, making it essential to (i) improve the identification of resistant bacteria to allow clinicians to prescribe effective drug regimens and (ii) develop new combination therapies effective at targeting resistant bacteria. Our results demonstrate that PETs, including MCR variants, are site-selective in Escherichia coli and that site-selectivity correlates with the level of susceptibility and fitness costs conferred by certain PETs.

Thus, this review aimed at providing an overview of LAB isolates derived from several unconventional sources such as fruits, seeds, fruit pulp, leaves, roots, vegetables, grasses, and flowers and with their antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral properties. This paper reviewed the antimicrobial properties of different genera, Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, Weissella, Enterococcus, Pediococcus, Bacillus, and Fructobacillus, their postbiotics, and paraprobiotics. Several important mechanisms, including the secretion of bacteriocins, bacteriocin-like substances, reuterin, organic acids (lactic and acetic), peptides, exopolysaccharides, and hydrogen peroxide, have been attributed to their antimicrobial actions against pathogens. However, their precise mode of action is poorly understood; hence, further research should be conducted to reveal detailed mechanisms. Finally, the review discusses the summary and future implications. Given the significance, LAB and derived antimicrobial compounds can potentially be exploited in food preservation and safety or for medicinal applications after evaluating their safety.", "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-01", "synthetic_support_claim": "The paper uniquely supports that plant-derived LAB isolates have significant antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral properties.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "LAB isolates significantly enhance human gut health beyond their antimicrobial properties."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "7d4e71cf5ea90546e3a9937219315a953594d096", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7d4e71cf5ea90546e3a9937219315a953594d096", "title": "Copper metabolism in cell death and autophagy", "abstract": "ABSTRACT Copper is an essential trace element in biological systems, maintaining the activity of enzymes and the function of transcription factors. However, at high concentrations, copper ions show increased toxicity by inducing regulated cell death, such as apoptosis, paraptosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis, and cuproptosis. Furthermore, copper ions can trigger macroautophagy/autophagy, a lysosome-dependent degradation pathway that plays a dual role in regulating the survival or death fate of cells under various stress conditions. Pathologically, impaired copper metabolism due to environmental or genetic causes is implicated in a variety of human diseases, such as rare Wilson disease and common cancers. Therapeutically, copper-based compounds are potential chemotherapeutic agents that can be used alone or in combination with other drugs or approaches to treat cancer. Here, we review the progress made in understanding copper metabolic processes and their impact on the regulation of cell death and autophagy. This knowledge may help in the design of future clinical tools to improve cancer diagnosis and treatment.

Schizophrenia (SZ), major depressive disorder (MDD), and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) showed a decreasing effect on cognitive performance, intelligence, and education, while bipolar disorder (BPD) increased educational attainment. MR-Clust results exhibit the shared genetic basis between SZ and other psychiatric disorders in relation to cognitive function.

Mediation MR analysis also supported the causal effects between psychiatric disorders and cognition via oxidative stress traits, including carotene, vitamin E, bilirubin, and uric acid.

Here, we report astrocyte molecular profiles, diversity, and morphology across the mouse central nervous system (CNS). We identified shared and region-specific astrocytic genes and functions and explored the cellular origins of their regional diversity. We identified gene networks correlated with astrocyte morphology, several of which unexpectedly contained Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) risk genes. CRISPR/Cas9\u2013mediated reduction of candidate genes reduced astrocyte morphological complexity and resulted in cognitive deficits. The same genes were down-regulated in human AD, in an AD mouse model that displayed reduced astrocyte morphology, and in other human brain disorders. We thus provide comprehensive molecular data on astrocyte diversity and mechanisms across the CNS and on the molecular basis of astrocyte morphology in health and disease. Description Astrocyte diversity and morphology Astrocytes are the major type of glia, displaying complex bushy morphologies as their defining feature. Endo et al. studied astrocyte similarities, diversity, and morphology across the mouse central nervous system (CNS) (see the Perspective by Baldwin). They identified gene networks related to astrocyte morphology between CNS regions, several of which unexpectedly included genes related to risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). When expression of these genes was reduced in mice, astrocyte morphological complexity was diminished, and mice exhibited impairments in a cognitive test. Remarkably, the same genes are down-regulated in both a mouse model of AD and in human AD and several other CNS disorders. These findings suggest that loss of astrocyte morphology may be therapeutically targetable in diverse CNS disorders. \u2014SMH The molecular basis of astrocyte diversity and of their complex morphology in health and disease states is elucidated. INTRODUCTION The central nervous system (CNS) comprises a large population of non-neuronal cells called glia. The predominant type of glia are astrocytes, which were discovered ~140 years ago. Astrocytes tile the entire CNS, serve critical homeostatic functions, and display complex, \u201cbushy\u201d morphologies\u2014their defining feature. Unlike CNS neurons, which are highly diverse, astrocytes have historically been considered largely homogenous, serving as a type of omnipresent glue that is equivalent between CNS areas. Although recent studies have challenged this belief, there has been no broad assessment of astrocyte diversity, similarity, or morphology across the CNS of any species. An important goal, therefore, is to rigorously understand the molecular similarities and differences between astrocytes in the CNS, to determine how they affect astrocyte morphology, and to determine how these properties relate to normal and disease conditions. RATIONALE It is critical to understand all cell types of the CNS in detail as part of our quest to explore fundamental biology and to develop new therapeutic strategies to treat CNS disorders. We studied astrocyte regional diversity and major signaling pathways using whole-brain imaging, astrocyte-neuron density, marker expression, astrocyte-specific and bulk tissue gene expression, single-cell gene expression, astrocyte morphology, and interrelationships between gene expression and morphology using bioinformatic methods across the CNS. The data were mined to identify genes and pathways related to astrocyte morphological complexity, which we explored experimentally using gene knockdowns. We then compared these morphology-related genes with astrocytic differentially expressed genes from an Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) mouse model displaying reduced astrocyte morphology, as well as in relation to gene expression in AD and other CNS disorders. RESULTS We found several hundred genes that were enriched within and shared among astrocytes in the CNS, with functions related to metabolism, cholesterol, and neurotransmitter uptake and biosynthesis. These genes represent the core functions of astrocytes, but little is known about approximately a third of them, implying that understanding the fundamental physiology of astrocytes across CNS areas is an important ongoing experimental goal. Our data also reveal that astrocytes have molecular features and functions specific to CNS regions, and that these region-specific functions arise from the local tissue environment and by variable representation of seven distinct astrocyte subclusters. We mined our data to identify gene networks related to astrocyte morphology, and unexpectedly discovered several AD risk genes. We developed astrocyte-specific CRISPR/Cas9\u2013based gene knockdown to reduce the expression of such genes in the hippocampus. We found a reduction of astrocyte morphology with changes in a cognitive task after knockdown of key morphology-related genes, indicating that astrocyte morphological changes affect neural circuit function. In addition to AD risk genes that were astrocyte morphology related, we found a significant association between morphology-related genes and those related to several other common CNS disorders. CONCLUSION We provide comprehensive molecular data that will allow many new types of experiments to explore core features of astrocytes across the CNS, in particular, those unique to specific regions and how they relate to the dynamics and biophysics of neural circuits in specific CNS regions. We used our data to identify the molecular underpinnings of astrocyte morphology between CNS regions and to show that reduced astrocyte morphological complexity, and the attendant loss of tissue support, is common to diverse CNS disorders. This raises the prospect that restoring astrocyte morphology, and thus the ensuing neuronal and tissue support functions, may be therapeutically beneficial in disease. Our findings provide the molecular basis to explore such strategies and to unravel the nascent underlying biology determining how astrocytes contribute to CNS function and dysfunction.

Peroxisomes and pexophagy are essential for balancing oxidative stress and protein degradation products. Our previous findings suggest that peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor \u03b2/\u03b4 (PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4) activation significantly alleviates depressive behaviors by preventing astrocytic injury. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, we established oxidative injury by treating astrocytes with corticosterone. Subsequently, PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 agonists and antagonists were applied to determine the effects of PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 on balancing peroxisomes and pexophagy in astrocytes. The PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 agonist (GW0742) significantly improved cell viability and decreased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production induced by corticosterone, while pretreatment with the PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4, antagonist GSK3787 reversed the effects of GW0742. Moreover, activating PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 promoted peroxisomal biogenesis factor 5 (PEX5)-mediated pexophagy by enhancing the phosphorylation of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase. Conversely, blocking PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 with GSK3787 partially abolished the effects of GW0742. Further investigations demonstrated that activation of PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 not only induced transcription of the ubiquitin protein ligase E3 component n-recognin 5 (UBR5) but also enhanced the interaction between PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 and UBR5, contributing to ATM interactor (ATMIN) degradation, and increased phosphorylated ATM kinase levels. Therefore, this study revealed that activating PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 improves corticosterone-induced oxidative damage in astrocytes by enhancing pexophagy. PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 directly interacts with UBR5 to facilitate ATMIN degradation and promotes ATM phosphorylation, thereby maintaining the balance between peroxisomes and pexophagy.

In this improved GSCA, we integrated expression, mutation, drug sensitivity and clinical data from four public data sources for 33 cancer types. We introduced useful features to GSCA, including associations between immune infiltration with gene expression and genomic variations, and associations between gene set expression/mutation and clinical outcomes. GSCA has four main functional modules for cancer GSA to explore, analyze and visualize expression, genomic variations, tumor immune infiltration, drug sensitivity and their associations with clinical outcomes.

A total of 600 CRC patients and 600 healthy control individuals were genotyped by a polymerase chain reaction-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis assay. The findings demonstrated that the rs34000982 Ins allele or Ins/Ins genotype was associated not only with reduced susceptibility to CRC, especially stage III-IV CRC (Ins vs. Del: OR = 0.65, 95%CI = 0.51-0.82, p\u2009<\u20090.001; Ins/Ins vs. Del/Del: OR = 0.29, 95%CI = 0.14- 0.60, p\u2009<\u20090.001), but also with tumor stage.

To explore the potential colocalization of GHSR and GLP-1R in specific neurons, we performed detailed mapping of cells positive for both receptors using GHSR-eGFP reporter mice or wild-type mice infused with fluorescent ghrelin, alongside an anti-GLP-1R antibody.

Characterization using a polyphasic taxonomic approach, whole-genome sequencing and phylogenomic analyses revealed a close genetic relationship among two strains from Mars 2020 cleanroom floors (179-C4-2-HS, 179-J1A1-HS), one strain from the Agave plant (AT2.8), and another strain from wheat-associated soil (V4I25). All four strains exhibited high 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity (>99.2%) and low average nucleotide identity (ANI) with Neobacillus niacini NBRC 15566T, delineating new phylogenetic branches within the genus. Detailed molecular analyses, including gyrB (90.2%), ANI (86.4%), average amino acid identity (87.8%) phylogenies, digital DNA\u2013DNA hybridization (32.6%), and percentage of conserved proteins (77.7%) indicated significant divergence from N. niacini NBRC 15566T. Consequently, these strains have been designated Neobacillus driksii sp. nov., with the type strain 179-C4-2-HST (DSM 115941T = NRRL B-65665T). N. driksii grew at 4\u00b0C to 45\u00b0C, pH range of 6.0 to 9.5, and 0.5% to 5% NaCl. The major cellular fatty acids are iso-C15:0 and anteiso-C15:0. The dominant polar lipids include diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, and an unidentified aminolipid. Metagenomic analysis within NASA cleanrooms revealed that N. driksii is scarce (17 out of 236 samples). Genes encoding the biosynthesis pathway for lasso peptides were identified in all N. driksii strains and are not commonly found in other Neobacillus species, except in 7 out of 26 recognized species. This study highlights the unique metabolic capabilities of N. driksii, underscoring their potential in antimicrobial research and biotechnology. IMPORTANCE The microbial surveillance of the Mars 2020 assembly cleanroom led to the isolation of novel N. driksii with potential applications in cleanroom environments, such as hospitals, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and aeronautical industries. N. driksii genomes were found to possess genes responsible for producing lasso peptides, which are crucial for antimicrobial defense, communication, and enzyme inhibition. Isolation of N. driksii from cleanrooms, Agave plants, and dryland wheat soils, suggested niche-specific ecology and resilience under various environmentally challenging conditions. The discovery of potent antimicrobial agents from novel N. driksii underscores the importance of genome mining and the isolation of rare microorganisms. Bioactive gene clusters potentially producing nicotianamine-like siderophores were found in N. driksii genomes.

Although these oligotrophic extremophiles are reported in small numbers, their resistance to environmental stresses, sparse presence, and difficulty in extracting biomolecules often lead to their omission, even with advanced sequencing technologies. Traditional metagenomic approaches fail to detect these rare species due to challenges in lysing robust microbial cells and isolating minute amounts of DNA from dominant microorganisms. Additionally, the absence of database references for novel extremophiles limits their identification. Over a six month period of monitoring Mars 2020 mission cleanrooms, 182 bacterial strains from 19 families were identified using advanced molecular techniques. This included 14 novel Gram-positive species, eight of which were spore-formers. Despite being present at only about 0.001% abundance in metagenomic sequencing data, they were successfully cultured.

Identifying reliable prognostic biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets is crucial for improving patient outcomes. Methods We conducted a comprehensive analysis of HJURP expression in LUAD using data from four cohorts: TCGA-LUAD (n = 453), GSE31210 (n = 226), GSE68465 (n = 442), and GSE72094 (n = 386). Univariate Cox regression analysis was employed to identify prognostic genes, with Kaplan-Meier survival analysis used to assess the predictive power of HJURP. Functional enrichment analyses were performed using MetaScape and FGSEA, and spatial transcriptomics and single-cell sequencing data were analyzed to explore HJURP\u2019s distribution and potential functions. Additionally, correlations between HJURP expression and genetic alterations, immune cell infiltration, and potential therapeutic responses were evaluated. Results HJURP was identified as a significant prognostic biomarker in all four cohorts, with high expression associated with increased risk of overall survival (OS) death (TCGA-LUAD: HR = 1.93, 95% CI: 1.321\u20132.815, P < 0.001; GSE31210: HR = 2.75, 95% CI: 1.319\u20135.735, P = 0.007; GSE68465: HR = 1.57, 95% CI: 1.215\u20132.038, P < 0.001; GSE72094: HR = 2.2, 95% CI: 1.485\u20133.27, P < 0.001). Functional analyses indicated that HJURP is involved in DNA metabolic processes, cell cycle regulation, and mitotic processes, with significant activation of pathways related to MYC targets, G2M checkpoint, and DNA repair. High HJURP expression was associated with higher mutation frequencies in TP53, CSMD3, TTN, and MUC16, and positively correlated with pro-inflammatory immune cell infiltration and several immune checkpoints, including PD-L1 and PD-L2. Chemotherapeutic agents such as gefitinib and sorafenib were predicted to be effective against high HJURP-expressing tumors.

Energy metabolism and the intestinal barrier perform distinct yet complementary roles that uphold intestinal ecological equilibrium. Disruptions in energy metabolism can compromise the integrity of the intestinal barrier; for example, inactivation of the AMPK pathway may lead to reduced expression of proteins associated with tight junctions. Conversely, impairment of the intestinal barrier can result in metabolic dysregulation, such as alterations in the gut microbiota that impede the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which are essential substrates for energy metabolism. This disruption can affect energy production and modify the gut\u2019s hypoxic environment. Imbalances in these systems have been associated with the onset of various intestinal diseases.

Methods: The dataset of gene expression profiling for PAH (GSE113439) was downloaded from the gene expression omnibus (GEO) database. Isorhamnetin target genes were extracted from the comparative toxicogenomics database (CTD). Various bioinformatics methods were employed to identify the core pathways associated with PAH and potential intervention targets. Molecular docking was conducted between the interacting target and the candidate compound, isorhamnetin. Results: One thousand nine hundred sixty-two upregulated genes and 642 downregulated genes were identified. Molecular complex detection analyses revealed that the significant biological processes associated with upregulated genes included DNA damage response, mitotic cell cycle, and chromosome organization. In contrast, the significant biological processes related to downregulated genes encompassed cellular response to growth factor stimulus, response to growth factor, and blood vessel development. Immune infiltration analysis indicated that PAH is associated with significant changes in the distribution of immune cells and differential expression of immune checkpoints. Furthermore, 58 isorhamnetin targets were extracted from the CTD, and we identified 1 interacting gene, NFE2L2, among the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), DEGs related to ferroptosis, and isorhamnetin targets. Isorhamnetin demonstrated strong affinities with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors and transcription factors (ATM and ZNF24) associated with VEGFs, as well as the ferroptosis protein NFE2L2. Conclusions: Pulmonary arterial hypertension is characterized by a series of abnormalities in downstream molecular signaling pathways, including DNA damage, immune dysregulation, VEGF signaling deficiency, and the ferroptosis process. These may represent the core pathophysiological mechanisms of PAH.

Intestinal innate immunity is enacted by neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs), and innate lymphoid cells and NK cells, characterized by their capacity to produce a rapid and nonspecific reaction as a first-line response. Innate immune cells (IIC) defend against pathogens and excessive entry of intestinal microorganisms, while preserving immune tolerance to resident intestinal microbiota. Changes to this equilibrium are linked to intestinal inflammation in the gut and IBD. IICs mediate host defense responses, inflammation, and tissue healing by producing cytokines and chemokines, activating the complement cascade and phagocytosis, or presenting antigens to activate the adaptive immune response. IICs exert important functions that promote or ameliorate the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie and sustain IBD.

In the critical redox system of mammalian cells, glutathione peroxidase (GPX) is the most prominent family of proteins with a multifaceted function that affects almost all cellular processes. A total of eight members of the GPX family are currently found, namely GPX1-GPX8. They have long been used as antioxidant enzymes to play an important role in combating oxidative stress and maintaining redox balance. However, each member of the GPX family has a different mechanism of action and site of action in maintaining redox balance. GPX1-4 and GPX6 use selenocysteine as the active center to catalyze the reduction of H2O2 or organic hydroperoxides to water or corresponding alcohols, thereby reducing their toxicity and maintaining redox balance. In addition to reducing H2O2 and small molecule hydroperoxides, GPX4 is also capable of reducing complex lipid compounds. It is the only enzyme in the GPX family that directly reduces and destroys lipid hydroperoxides. The active sites of GPX5 and GPX7-GPX8 do not contain selenium cysteine (Secys), but instead, have cysteine residues (Cys) as their active sites. GPX5 is mainly expressed in epididymal tissue and plays a role in protecting sperm from oxidative stress. Both enzymes, GPX7 and GPX8, are located in the endoplasmic reticulum and are necessary enzymes involved in the oxidative folding of endoplasmic reticulum proteins, and GPX8 also plays an important role in the regulation of Ca2+ in the endoplasmic reticulum.

Fruit waste contains different bioactive compounds like polyphenols, flavonoids, vitamins, and carotenoids, which are, in large part, underutilized regardless of their antioxidant properties. These compounds can play an important function in poultry nutrition, offering natural alternatives to synthetic antioxidants. Reintegrating fruit waste into poultry diets might have potent benefits on the nutritional quality and shelf life of eggs. Some studies reported that bioactive compounds from fruit waste improve the oxidative stability of eggs and the nutritional content, potentially extending shelf life during storage. Additionally, antioxidant compounds from fruit waste have been shown to improve yolk coloration and some egg quality parameters while reducing reactive oxygen species, which cause lipid oxidation. Their inclusion in poultry diets can lower feed costs, promote animal welfare, and reduce the environmental impact of fruit waste. This review highlights some key fruit wastes, such as citrus, apple, grape, rosehip, sea buckthorn, and banana, among others, which are natural reservoirs of bioactive compounds beneficial for poultry nutrition.

Bacterial motility is known to contribute to host colonization. We have previously identified pseudovibriamides A and B, produced in culture by Pseudovibrio brasiliensis Ab134, and shown that pseudovibriamide A promotes flagellar motility. Pseudovibriamides are encoded in a hybrid nonribosomal peptide synthetase-polyketide synthase gene cluster that also includes several accessory genes. Pseudovibriamide A is a linear heptapeptide and pseudovibriamide B is a nonadepsipeptide derived from pseudovibriamide A. Here, we define the borders of the pseudovibriamides gene cluster, assign function to biosynthetic genes using reverse genetics, and test the hypothesis that pseudovibriamides impact motility by modulating gene transcription. RNA-sequencing transcriptomic analyses of strains having different compositions of pseudovibriamides suggested that both pseudovibriamides A and B affect genes potentially involved in motility, and that a compensatory mechanism is at play in mutants that produce only pseudovibriamide A, resulting in comparable flagellar motility as the wild type. The data gathered suggest that pseudovibriamides A and B have opposite roles in modulating a subset of genes, with pseudovibriamide B having a primary effect in gene activation, and pseudovibriamide A on inhibition. Finally, we observed many differentially expressed genes (up to 29% of the total gene number) indicating that pseudovibriamides have a global effect on transcription that goes beyond motility. IMPORTANCE Marine sponges are found throughout the oceans from tropical coral reefs to polar sea floors, playing crucial roles in marine ecosystems. Pseudovibrio bacteria have been proposed to contribute to sponge health. We have previously shown that pseudovibriamides produced by Pseudovibrio brasiliensis promote bacterial motility, a behavior that is beneficial to bacterial survival and host colonization. The gene cluster that encodes pseudovibriamide biosynthesis is found in two-thirds of Pseudovibrio genomes. This gene cluster is also present in Pseudomonas bacteria that interact with terrestrial plants and animals. Here, we first assign functions to pseudovibriamide biosynthetic genes using reverse genetics. We then show that pseudovibriamides play a major role in transcriptional regulation, affecting up to 29% of P. brasiliensis genes, including motility genes.

Recently, generative artificial intelligence (AI) has showcased remarkable capabilities in synthesizing realistic data. To effectively address the challenges of nonindependent and identically distributed (non-IID) data, this article introduces a collaborative AI training framework that leverages generative AI to enhance the learning performance of FL. In this framework, heterogeneous edge devices (HEDs) identify specific data categories lacking in their local data sets and acquire these data from generative AI providers (GAPs). This strategy aims to improve the convergence rate of FL. However, HEDs and GAPs may be reluctant to contribute their resources to FL training due to self-interest. Therefore, an incentive mechanism is necessary to encourage their participation. We propose a reverse auction model to facilitate data transactions among FL training buyers, GAPs, and HEDs within the FL training buyer\u2019s budget. It focuses on determining winners and devising payment rules to maximize the FL training buyer\u2019s utility. This involves solving a 0-1 programming problem with two sellers (GAPs and HEDs). To tackle this, we use joint bidding and virtual seller pairs for analysis. We demonstrate that our method ensures truthfulness, individual rationality, and computational efficiency. Furthermore, we employ a one-side matching mechanism to approximate the optimal solution. We further investigate a strategy to analyze and allocate data based on variance, aiming to minimize non-IID issues in local data. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed matching mechanism can effectively improve the computational efficiency, with the test accuracy differing from the theoretical optimum by only about 0.7%, and our mechanism can outperform the other greedy algorithms.

However, the extracellular matrix (ECM), which comprises at least a third of tissue structures, remains relatively underexplored in immunology. Similarly, matrix biologists often overlook regulation of complex structural matrices by the immune system. We are only beginning to understand the scale at which ECM structures determine immune cell localization and function. Additionally, we need to better understand how immune cells dictate ECM complexity. This review aims to highlight the potential for biological discovery at the interface of immunology and matrix biology. Description Immune cells in the extracellular matrix The extracellular matrix is a dynamic tissue support network that is made up of components including fibrillar proteins, glycosaminoglycans, proteoglycans, and mucus. There is growing knowledge that this network has an intricate relationship with immune cells, which has important implications for our understanding of host defense, wound repair, fibrotic disease, and aging. Sutherland et al. reviewed the latest research on the interconnectedness of these systems with an emphasis on how this cross talk is an important element in the success (or failure) of immune cell\u2013based therapies. \u2014STS A review explains that the extracellular matrix and immune system are highly interconnected networks integral to tissue homeostasis and disease. BACKGROUND The extracellular matrix (ECM) forms a dynamic structure around cells that is essential for the supply of environmental factors, mechanical support, and protection of tissues. It includes components such as fibrillar proteins, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), proteoglycans, and mucus. The molecular, physical, and mechanical properties of the ECM regulate immune cell mobility, survival, and function. In turn, the immune system maintains and regulates healthy matrix and restores matrix integrity after injury. A dysregulated ECM\u2013immune system partnership contributes to most diseases. Exploring the complex interconnectivity between ECM biology and immune cells has the potential to help treat disease and maintain healthy aging. ADVANCES Immune cells are perpetually in contact with the ECM, yet the potential consequences of these interactions often remain unexplored. One function of the ECM is to guide immune cell movement and positioning. T cells, for example, move through sites containing thin ECM fibers in preference to more densely cross-linked collagen matrices, whereas heparan sulfate proteoglycans within the vasculature and tissue parenchyma bind and present chemokines to form gradients that direct cell movement. During inflammation, injury, infection, or even aging, ECM components can be released to act as \u201cdanger signals.\u201d Conversely, the breakdown of the ECM by matrix-degrading enzymes can generate immunoregulatory fragments. Critically, because cytokines are often bound to GAGs, ECM changes can regulate cytokine availability or activity. During aging and fibrotic diseases, changes to the fibrillar collagen network result in pathological tissue stiffness and loss of mechanical compliance. Additionally, increases in the GAG hyaluronan contribute to altered ECM mechanical properties that accompany aging and disease. There is increasing evidence that immune cell function is regulated by mechanosensing receptors such as Piezo1, and these ECM changes have major impacts on immune function. Furthermore, a decline in the activity of the mechanosensing transcriptional activators YAP and TAZ during physiological aging results in failure to down-regulate inflammation. Thus, ECM composition actively regulates immune processes, but immune signals will themselves regulate ECM composition, reflecting an essential bidirectional dialog. One prominent way that the immune system regulates the ECM is through transforming growth factor\u2013\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), which promotes myofibroblast differentiation and collagen production and inhibits matrix-degrading metalloproteinases. Furthermore, type 2 cytokines, particularly interleukin-13 (IL-13), have emerged as modulators of ECM quantity and quality, which includes regulating the mucosal barrier. Moreover, direct biophysical interaction with chemokines or cytokines can alter ECM structure and/or function. For instance, CXCL4 (PF4) functions by binding to GAGs rather than by directly binding to chemokine receptors. This can lead to remodeling of the cell surface ECM and signaling through proteoglycans. Immune cells control ECM not only through the production of cytokines and chemokines but also by direct synthesis of ECM components and the enzymes that break them down. Enzymatic remodeling of the rigid basement membrane by tissue-infiltrating myeloid cells, for example, can provide routes for lymphocytes to follow. Macrophages, which are pivotal in ECM turnover through receptor-mediated uptake of and degradation of collagen, also produce collagens that may provide templates for tissue remodeling. Neutrophils can pull and carry preexisting matrix from nearby sites to wound beds early in the tissue repair process to reestablish new ECM scaffolds. OUTLOOK The ECM, long considered an inert scaffold, can now be seen as a highly dynamic partner to the immune system. In this review, we aim to highlight the absolute interdependence of these systems with consequences for therapy. For example, immune cell\u2013based therapies may fail if they are placed in diseased matrix that itself drives pathology. Ultimately, to answer the most pressing questions in tissue health, it will be critical that immunologists and matrix biologists work together. Interconnectivity between the ECM and the immune system. (A) Physical and molecular properties of the ECM control immune cell positioning and migration within a tissue during pathology. (B) Aging not only alters the mechanical properties of ECM, which are sensed by the immune system, but also reduces mechanosensors that down-regulate proinflammatory pathways. (C and D) The immunomodulatory cytokine IL-13 can remodel the mucus barrier (C), whereas immune cells themselves can carry matrix across tissues to help build an ECM scaffold for repair (D).

It was found that with moderate salinization, the seeds of both species successfully germinated, but the growth of shoots and the accumulation of aboveground biomass were inhibited, which was partly due to a slowdown in the rate of photosynthesis. With strong salinity, distinct interspecific differences were observed in the response of plants. In particular, the number of germinated seeds decreased in barley, while in wheat it remained at the control level. In barley, shoot growth was inhibited to a greater extent, whereas in wheat, the accumulation of aboveground biomass was. The content of pigments in barley plants decreased, and the content of wheat increased. At the same time, stomatal conductivity decreased in both species and the rate of photosynthesis slowed down. It is concluded that based on the energy of germination and germination of seeds, it is possible to determine the salt resistance of species only to a high level of salinity (200 mM NaCl). Morphometric indicators of shoot growth make it possible to assess the resistance of plants to salinity already at lower salt concentrations (100 mM NaCl).

This research involved a group receiving regular watering with half strength Hoagland\u2019s solution (HS), and other group watered with a modified form of the same solution containing 75 mM NaCl to stimulate salt stress. Seedlings were treated with foliar applications of Spd (0, 0.5, 1 mM) at five intervals: 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 d after sowing. Applying Spd significantly reduced damage caused by salt and protected essential pigments for photosynthesis (total chlorophyll by 33% and carotenoids by 57% over than the Spd-untreated plants under saline conditions). Additionally, 1 mM Spd enhanced the antioxidant enzyme activities, i.e., superoxide dismutase, catalase, and ascorbate peroxidase by 15%, 55% and 4.6% and promoted the buildup of beneficial compounds like proline, free amino acids and sugars. Remarkably, exogenous Spd application reduced Na + accumulation while improving K + content in common beans under salinity stress. Additionally, it enhanced the cell membrane stability index (CMSI) during stressful situations, the maximum CMSI (94.31%) was recorded with 1 mM Spd under non-stress conditions, whereas the minimum CMSI (72.97%) was registered under salinity without Spd. Under salinity condition, the real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) results demonstrated a significant increase in the expression of the vacuolar-localized Na + /H + antiporter protein (NHX1), and the multifunctional osmotic protection protein (Osmotin) in comparison to the control. Furthermore, common bean treated with Spd showed significantly higher expression levels of SOS1 , NHX1 , and Osmotin , under normal and salinity conditions, with the highest gene expression observed under 1 mM spermidine treatment under saline conditions. Spermidine at 1 mM notably decreased malondialdehyde levels compared to 0.5 mM (10.68 vs . 12.11 nmol g - \u00b9 FW).

A substantial body of evidence indicates that this characteristic pattern of responses can be explained by the action of SGLT2 inhibitors to promote cellular housekeeping by enhancing autophagic flux, an effect that may be related to the action of these drugs to produce simultaneous upregulation of nutrient deprivation signaling and downregulation of nutrient surplus signaling, as manifested by an increase in the expression and activity of AMPK (adenosine monophosphate\u2013activated protein kinase), SIRT1 (sirtuin 1), SIRT3 (sirtuin 3), SIRT6 (sirtuin 6), and PGC1-\u03b1 (peroxisome proliferator\u2013activated receptor \u03b3 coactivator 1-\u03b1) and decreased activation of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin). The distinctive pattern of cardioprotective and renoprotective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors is abolished by specific inhibition or knockdown of autophagy, AMPK, and sirtuins. In the clinical setting, the pattern of differentially increased proteins identified in proteomics analyses of blood collected in randomized trials is consistent with these findings. Clinical studies have also shown that SGLT2 inhibitors promote gluconeogenesis, ketogenesis, and erythrocytosis and reduce uricemia, the hallmarks of nutrient deprivation signaling and the principal statistical mediators of the ability of SGLT2 inhibitors to reduce the risk of heart failure and serious renal events. The action of SGLT2 inhibitors to augment autophagic flux is seen in isolated cells and tissues that do not express SGLT2 and are not exposed to changes in environmental glucose or ketones and may be related to an ability of these drugs to bind directly to sirtuins or mTOR. Changes in renal or cardiovascular physiology or metabolism cannot explain the benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors either experimentally or clinically. The direct molecular effects of SGLT2 inhibitors in isolated cells are consistent with the concept that SGLT2 acts as a nutrient surplus sensor, and thus, its inhibition causes enhanced nutrient deprivation signaling and its attendant cytoprotective effects, which can be abolished by specific inhibition or knockdown of AMPK, sirtuins, and autophagic flux.", "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-11-01", "synthetic_support_claim": "SGLT2 inhibitors enhance autophagic flux by upregulating AMPK, SIRT1, SIRT3, SIRT6, and PGC1-\u03b1.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "SGLT2 inhibitors are effective in treating all types of cancer by promoting autophagic flux."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "206ef72494d5c761a9946d1230ba23aebe98ad77", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/206ef72494d5c761a9946d1230ba23aebe98ad77", "title": "Early combination therapy with SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA or dual GIP/GLP-1 RA in type 2 diabetes.", "abstract": "Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and glucagon-Like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) are recommended in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) for glycaemic control and for people with high cardiovascular risk.

Despite advancements in precision medicine, international guidelines for T2D continue to prioritize individualized therapeutic approaches focused on glycemic control and complications, and many healthcare providers predominantly maintain a glucocentric strategy. This review advocates for an adipocentric treatment paradigm for most individuals with T2D, emphasizing the importance of prioritizing weight loss and visceral fat reduction as key drivers of therapeutic intensification.

Various chemical and physical techniques have been developed to remediate soils contaminated with organic pollutants, but challenges related to cost, efficacy, and toxic byproducts often limit their sustainability. Fortunately, phytoremediation, achieved through the use of plants and associated microbiomes, has shown great promise for tackling environmental pollution; this technology has been tested both in the laboratory and in the field. Plant\u2013microbe interactions further promote the efficacy of phytoremediation, with plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) often used to assist the remediation of organic pollutants. However, the efficiency of microbe-assisted phytoremediation can be impeded by (i) high concentrations of secondary toxins, (ii) the absence of a suitable sink for these toxins, (iii) nutrient limitations, (iv) the lack of continued release of microbial inocula, and (v) the lack of shelter or porous habitats for planktonic organisms. In this regard, biochar affords unparalleled positive attributes that make it a suitable bacterial carrier and soil health enhancer.

This study introduces a precipitation-based fluorescent probe (PFP) method for in situ, high-resolution (micrometer scale) mapping of H2O2 diffusion in soils. Using the PFP method, we visualized real-time H2O2 diffusion in various types of soils, revealing distinct diffusion patterns with rates ranging from 0.011 to >0.56 mm min-1. The observed differences in diffusion rates are associated with soil permeability. Additionally, soils exhibited a wide range of diffusion distances, from 0.22 to >11 mm in 20 min. Soil's reactivity for H2O2 decomposition, a previously overlooked factor, is critical in determining the diffusion distance of H2O2.

This investigation introduces a contrastive learning-augmented hypergraph neural network model, termed CLHGNNMDA, aimed at predicting associations between miRNAs and diseases. Initially, CLHGNNMDA constructs multiple hypergraphs by leveraging diverse similarity metrics related to miRNAs and diseases. Subsequently, hypergraph convolution is applied to each hypergraph to extract feature representations for nodes and hyperedges. Following this, autoencoders are employed to reconstruct information regarding the feature representations of nodes and hyperedges and to integrate various features of miRNAs and diseases extracted from each hypergraph. Finally, a joint contrastive loss function is utilized to refine the model and optimize its parameters. The CLHGNNMDA framework employs multi-hypergraph contrastive learning for the construction of a contrastive loss function. This approach takes into account inter-view interactions and upholds the principle of consistency, thereby augmenting the model's representational efficacy.

This term encompasses a wide range of techniques that promise to transform many areas of biology and eventually revolutionize pathology by measuring physical tissue structure and molecular characteristics at the same time. Although the field came of age in the past 5 years, it still suffers from some growing pains: barriers to entry, robustness, unclear best practices for experimental design and analysis, and lack of standardization. In this Review, we present a systematic catalog of the different families of spatial omics technologies; highlight their principles, power, and limitations; and give some perspective and suggestions on the biggest challenges that lay ahead in this incredibly powerful\u2014but still hard to navigate\u2014landscape. Description Editor\u2019s summary All of biology happens in space. In living organisms, cells must interact and assemble in three-dimensional tissues. The position of each cell is just as important as its intrinsic nature in determining how a tissue functions or malfunctions in a disease. Recently, many technologies have been invented to profile cells without removing them from their natural context, measuring gene expression and the regulatory landscape of a cell\u2019s genome alongside its spatial location within a tissue. In a review, Bressan et al. describe the features of these methods, collectively named spatial omics, and discuss what is missing for them to unlock their full potential. \u2014Stella M. Hurtley and Gemma Alderton A review discusses recent advances in methods for spatial omics. BACKGROUND Just as single-cell sequencing has revolutionized many fields of biology, spatial \u201comics,\u201d in which molecular parameters are measured in situ on intact tissue samples, is set to empower a new generation of scientific discoveries. A plethora of new technologies now enable spatial profiling of gene and protein expression, genetic mutations, epigenetic marks, chromatin structure, and genome organization. Most of these methods trace back to traditional techniques such as immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, or leverage the throughput of next-generation sequencing by converting spatial coordinates to sequence barcodes. Spatial omics technologies operate at vastly different levels of resolution, sensitivity, and throughput. There are also considerable differences in ease of adoption, compatibility with different sample types, commercial availability, upfront investment, and cost per sample. In such a rich and constantly evolving field, choosing the best technology to address a specific biological challenge\u2014carefully weighting the strengths and weaknesses of each\u2014is critical. ADVANCES The field of spatial molecular profiling has come of age over the past few years. Current RNA profiling technologies allow the spatial measurement of gene expression for centimeter-scale samples\u2014in many cases, at single-cell resolution. Targeted methods can quantify thousands of transcripts, including those of very low abundance, whereas untargeted protocols offer transcriptome-wide profiling and can even detect gene isoforms and mutations, with coverage approaching that of disaggregated single-cell methods. Multiplexed immunohistochemistry protocols, either based on mass spectrometry or fluorescence imaging, can similarly be used to profile tens to hundreds of protein markers on a wide range of samples. Recent studies have reported additional approaches that recover other types of molecular information, including the spatial profiling of genomic organization for thousands of loci, open chromatin and epigenetic marks, and untargeted in situ DNA sequencing. Multi-omic technologies capturing multiple sources of information at once are also becoming available. As these methods become more reliable and widely adopted, it is becoming increasingly clear that spatial omics will contribute substantially to the elucidation of many biological questions, with prominent examples in fields ranging from oncology (such as the study of tumor heterogeneity and microenvironment) to neuroscience and organismal development. OUTLOOK Future development trends in the spatial omic area are needed in three main areas: (i) multi-omics, which is defined as the simultaneous measurement of different parameters (for example, DNA, RNA, and protein); (ii) increased access and democratization, with technologies becoming more readily available, more reliable, and more robust; and (iii) improved analysis frameworks. As technologies continue to evolve, it will become necessary to dedicate more attention to data analysis and experimental design. Spatial omics technologies can already generate many terabytes of data in a single experiment, creating substantial challenges in data processing, analysis, and visualization. Statistical methods and guidelines for sample replication, study design, and batch correction are also lagging behind, although they\u2019re evolving rapidly. Last, as the future keeps getting closer, we foresee that spatial omics will likely evolve toward three-dimensional spatial omics (operating on whole organs or even organisms) and spatial-temporal omics (performing measurements multiple times in vivo), adding further powerful and exciting tools to biology\u2019s toolbox. Spatial omics methods profile the molecular make-up of tissues, preserving their spatial organization through four main steps. (A) Detection. Oligonucleotide probes or modified antibodies bind to specific nucleic acids, proteins, or small molecules. Alternatively, enzymatic processes can detect RNA (reverse transcription) or DNA (tagmentation) in an untargeted fashion. Single or multiple types of biomolecules can be profiled simultaneously. (B) Identification. Biomolecules can be identified directly with next-generation sequencing or mass spectrometry, or indirectly by means of an individual tag on the detection probe that is either read at once or sequentially (combinatorial barcode). (C) Measurement. Imaging-based methods measure the signal intensity of fluorescent probes or count the number of spots per area (single-molecule localization methods). Sequencing-based methods quantify the abundance of biomolecules through normalized read count or using unique molecular identifiers (UMIs). (D) Localization. Biomolecules are assigned to their spatial locations either directly in imaging-based methods, or by means of a DNA barcode decoded through sequencing. Technologies differ widely in terms of spatial resolution, sensitivity, and number and size of areas that can be profiled.", "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-08-04", "synthetic_support_claim": "Spatial omics technologies can measure gene expression within tissue samples at single-cell resolution.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Spatial omics has already identified all molecular interactions critical to understanding complex diseases."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "80de43cffa9a8e686961b9f2147bf3031da0b7f4", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/80de43cffa9a8e686961b9f2147bf3031da0b7f4", "title": "Transcriptome and Temporal Transcriptome Analyses in Single Cells", "abstract": "Transcriptome analysis in single cells, enabled by single-cell RNA sequencing, has become a prevalent approach in biomedical research, ranging from investigations of gene regulation to the characterization of tissue organization.

This success stems from the use of the attention mechanism by these models in order to represent and propagate pairwise interactions between individual tokens of sequential data. However, the primary limitation of this operation is its quadratic memory and time complexity in relation to the input's context length - the length of a sequence over which the interactions need to be captured. This significantly limits the length of sequences that can be inferred upon by these models. Extensive research has been conducted to reduce the number of pairwise interactions to sub-quadratic in relation to the context length by introducing sparsity into the attention mechanism through the development of sparse attention masks. However, efficient implementations that achieve\"true sparsity\"are lacking. In this work, we address this issue by proposing a graph computing view of attention where tokens are perceived as nodes of the graph and the attention mask determines the edges of the graph. Using this view, we develop graph processing algorithms to implement the attention mechanism.

We find that concentrations of circulating taurine decline with aging in mice, monkeys, and humans. A reversal of this decline through taurine supplementation increased the health span (the period of healthy living) and life span in mice and health span in monkeys. Mechanistically, taurine reduced cellular senescence, protected against telomerase deficiency, suppressed mitochondrial dysfunction, decreased DNA damage, and attenuated inflammaging. In humans, lower taurine concentrations correlated with several age-related diseases and taurine concentrations increased after acute endurance exercise.

Studying various animals, Singh et al. found that the amount of the semi-essential amino acid taurine in circulation decreased with age (see the Perspective by McGaunn and Baur).

Taurine supplementation improved life span in mice and health span in monkeys. \u2014L. Bryan Ray Taurine supplementation extends healthy lifespan in worms, rodents, and non-human primates. INTRODUCTION Aging is an inevitable multifactorial process. Aging-related changes manifest as the \u201challmarks of aging,\u201d cause organ functions to decline, and increase the risk of disease and death. Aging is associated with systemic changes in the concentrations of molecules such as metabolites. However, whether such changes are merely the consequence of aging or whether these molecules are drivers of aging remains largely unexplored. If these were blood-based drivers of aging, then restoring their concentration or functions to \u201cyouthful\u201d levels could serve as an antiaging intervention. RATIONALE Taurine, a semiessential micronutrient, is one of the most abundant amino acids in humans and other eukaryotes. Earlier studies have shown that the concentration of taurine in blood correlates with health, but it is unknown whether blood taurine concentrations affect aging. To address this gap in knowledge, we measured the blood concentration of taurine during aging and investigated the effect of taurine supplementation on health span and life span in several species. RESULTS Blood concentration of taurine declines with age in mice, monkeys, and humans. To investigate whether this decline contributes to aging, we orally fed taurine or a control solution once daily to middle-aged wild-type female and male C57Bl/6J mice until the end of life. Taurine-fed mice of both sexes survived longer than the control mice. The median life span of taurine-treated mice increased by 10 to 12%, and life expectancy at 28 months increased by about 18 to 25%. A meaningful antiaging therapy should not only improve life span but also health span, the period of healthy living. We, therefore, investigated the health of taurine-fed middle-aged mice and found an improved functioning of bone, muscle, pancreas, brain, fat, gut, and immune system, indicating an overall increase in health span. We observed similar effects in monkeys. To check whether the observed effects of taurine transcended the species boundary, we investigated whether taurine supplementation increased life span in worms and yeast. Although taurine did not affect the replicative life span of unicellular yeast, it increased life span in multicellular worms. Investigations into the mechanism or mechanisms through which taurine supplementation improved the health span and life span revealed that taurine positively affected several hallmarks of aging. Taurine reduced cellular senescence, protected against telomerase deficiency, suppressed mitochondrial dysfunction, decreased DNA damage, and attenuated inflammation. An association analysis of metabolite clinical risk factors in humans showed that lower taurine, hypotaurine, and N-acetyltaurine concentrations were associated with adverse health, such as increased abdominal obesity, hypertension, inflammation, and prevalence of type 2 diabetes. Moreover, we found that a bout of exercise increased the concentrations of taurine metabolites in blood, which might partially underlie the antiaging effects of exercise. CONCLUSION Taurine abundance decreases during aging. A reversal of this decline through taurine supplementation increases health span and life span in mice and worms and health span in monkeys. This identifies taurine deficiency as a driver of aging in these species. To test whether taurine deficiency is a driver of aging in humans as well, long-term, well-controlled taurine supplementation trials that measure health span and life span as outcomes are required. Taurine deficiency as a driver of aging. Taurine concentration in blood declines with aging (top left). A reversal of this drop through taurine supplementation increased healthy life span in mice and worms but not in yeast (bottom left and top middle). Taurine supplementation affected several hallmarks of aging (middle). In humans, lower taurine concentrations were associated with multiple diseases (top right). A randomized controlled clinical trial in humans is warranted to assess the antiaging effects of taurine (bottom right).

Since the last report in 2016, ConSurf has been improved in multiple ways. It now has a user\u2010friendly interface that makes it easier to perform the analysis and to visualize the results. Evolutionary rates are calculated based on a set of homologous sequences, collected using hidden Markov model\u2010based search tools, recently embedded in the pipeline. Using these, and following the removal of redundancy, ConSurf assembles a representative set of effective homologues for protein and nucleic acid queries to enable informative analysis of the evolutionary patterns.

In this respect, the availability of AlphaFold model structures of essentially all UniProt proteins makes ConSurf particularly relevant to the research community.

MSCs derived from bone marrow, adipose tissue, and other sources can self-renew and differentiate into multiple cell types. In aging cartilage, they aid in tissue regeneration by secreting growth factors and cytokines that enhance repair and modulate immune responses. Recent preclinical studies show that MSCs can restore cartilage integrity, reduce inflammation, and improve joint function, although clinical translation remains challenging due to limitations such as cell viability, scalability, and regulatory concerns. Advancements in MSC delivery, including scaffold-based approaches and engineered exosomes, may improve therapeutic effectiveness. Potential risks, such as tumorigenicity and immune rejection, are also discussed, emphasizing the need for optimized treatment protocols and large-scale clinical trials to develop effective, minimally invasive therapies for cartilage regeneration.", "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-11-30", "synthetic_support_claim": "Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) can restore cartilage integrity and improve joint function in preclinical studies.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "MSCs can fully reverse cartilage degeneration in all osteoarthritis patients independently of disease severity and progression stage."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "c475c82f2fee608c090f02ea22f5fefa63e5b34f", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c475c82f2fee608c090f02ea22f5fefa63e5b34f", "title": "Design of an Effective sgRNA for CRISPR/Cas9 Knock-Ins and Full Mutant Segregation in Polyploid Synechocystis sp.

In this review we critically evaluate the epidemiological and biological evidence on the associations of these factors with PD and review evidence on whether these putative associations are causal.

Through genome association analysis of sorghum, a naturally high-alkaline\u2013tolerant crop, we detected a major locus, Alkaline Tolerance 1 (AT1), specifically related to alkaline-salinity sensitivity. An at1 allele with a carboxyl-terminal truncation increased sensitivity, whereas knockout of AT1 increased tolerance to alkalinity in sorghum, millet, rice, and maize. AT1 encodes an atypical G protein \u03b3 subunit that affects the phosphorylation of aquaporins to modulate the distribution of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). These processes appear to protect plants against oxidative stress by alkali. Designing knockouts of AT1 homologs or selecting its natural nonfunctional alleles could improve crop productivity in sodic lands. Description Growth on alkaline soils Alkaline soils limit the ability of plants to take in nutrients and manage salt stress. Zhang et al. have now identified a locus in sorghum that determines sensitivity to salty alkaline soils. The Alkali Tolerance 1 (AT1) locus encodes a guanine nucleotide\u2013binding protein gamma subunit that regulates the phosphorylation of aquaporins, channels that can transport hydrogen peroxide to alleviate oxidative stress. Crops that could better manage growth on alkaline soils could open up agriculture to the millions of hectares of alkaline soils. \u2014PJH Regulation of phosphorylation on aquaporin underlies the ability of sorghum to tolerate alkaline soils. INTRODUCTION According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), there are currently >1 billion ha of land affected by salt. Among these, ~60% are classified as sodic soil areas. These have high pH and are dominated by sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) and sodium carbonate (Na2CO3). The effects of global warming and a lack of fresh water will lead to >50% of arable land becoming affected by salt by 2050, thus severely affecting the world\u2019s food security. Identifying and/or engineering sodic-tolerant crops is imperative to solve this challenge. Although salinity tolerance has been studied extensively, alkalinity tolerance in plants has not been studied in depth. RATIONALE Sorghum originates from Africa, where it can grow in harsh environments. As a result, sorghum has evolved greater tolerance to adapt to multiple abiotic stresses compared with other crops. Some sorghum varieties can survive in sodic soil with a pH as high as 10.0. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis was performed with a large sorghum association panel consisting of 352 representative sorghum accessions. We detected a major locus, Alkaline tolerance 1 (AT1), linked to alkaline tolerance. We found that AT1, encoding an atypical G protein \u03b3 subunit (a homolog to rice GS3), contributes to alkaline sensitivity by modulating the efflux of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) under environmental stress. RESULTS On the basis of the results of the GWAS analysis, we sequenced the cDNA regions of SbAT1 (Sorghum bicolor AT1) in 37 sorghum accessions with different degrees of alkaline sensitivity. Two typical haplotypes (Hap1 and Hap2) of SbAT1 were identified according to the five leading variant sites associated with sorghum alkali sensitivity. Hap1 encodes an intact SbAT1. A frame shift mutation (from \u201cG\u201d to \u201cGGTGGC\u201d) within Hap2 results in a premature stop codon probably encoding a truncated protein with only 136 amino acids at the N terminus (named Sbat1). To confirm the function of the AT1 locus, we generated a pair of near-isogenic lines (NILs) with two AT1 haplotypes to assess the allelic effect of AT1 on sorghum tolerance to alkali. We found that the Sbat1 allele (Hap2), encoding a truncated form of SbAT1, increased plant alkaline sensitivity compared with wild-type full-length SbAT1 (Hap1). Overexpression of AT1/GS3 reduced alkaline tolerance in sorghum and rice, and overexpression of the C-terminal truncated AT1/GS3 showed a more severe alkaline sensitive response. This was confirmed in millet and rice, which suggests that AT1/GS3 functions negatively in plant alkali tolerance. By contrast, knockout (ko) of AT1/GS3 increased tolerance to alkaline stress in sorghum, millet, rice, and maize, which indicates a conserved pathway in monocot crops. By immunoprecipitation in combination with mass spectrometry (IP-MS), we found that AT1/GS3 interacts with aquaporin PIP2s that are involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis. Genetic analysis showed that OsPIP2;1ko/2;2ko had lower alkaline tolerance than their wild-type control. The redox probe Cyto-roGFP2-Orp1 sensing H2O2 in the cytoplasm was applied. The results showed that, upon alkaline treatment, the relative H2O2 level increased in OsPIP2;1ko/2;2ko compared with wild-type plants. These results suggested that the phosphorylation of aquaporins could modulate the efflux of H2O2. G\u03b3 negatively regulates the phosphorylation of PIP2;1, leading to elevated ROS levels in plants under alkaline stress. To assess the application of the AT1/GS3 gene for crop production, field tests were carried out. We found that the nonfunctional mutant, either obtained from natural varieties or generated by gene editing in several monocots, including sorghum, millet, rice, and maize, can improve the field performance of crops in terms of biomass or grain production when cultivated on sodic lands. CONCLUSION We concluded that SbAT1 encodes an atypical G protein \u03b3 subunit and inhibits the phosphorylation of aquaporins that may be used as H2O2 exporters under alkaline stress. With this knowledge, genetically engineered crops with knockouts of AT1 homologs or use of natural nonfunctional alleles could greatly improve crop yield in sodic lands. This may contribute to maximizing the use of global sodic lands to ensure food security. Genetic modification of AT1 enhances alkaline stress tolerance. The G\u03b3 subunit, AT1, pairs with G\u03b2 to negatively modulate the phosphorylation level of PIP2 aquaporins. Thus, AT1 reduces the H2O2 export activity of PIP2s, leading to the overaccumulation of H2O2 and resulting in alkaline stress sensitivity. By contrast, the artificial or natural knockouts of AT1 homologs release the inhibition of PIP2s by AT1 in crops and have improved survival rates and yield under alkaline stress.

To begin with, three representative cultivars were selected from a population of 200 flax germplasm and assessed their physiological and transcriptomic responses to salt stress. The cultivar C121 exhibited superior osmoregulation, antioxidant capacity, and growth under salt stress compared to the other two cultivars. Through transcriptome sequencing, a total of 7,459 differentially expressed genes associated with salt stress were identified, which were mainly enriched in pathways related to response to toxic substances, metal ion transport, and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. Furthermore, genotyping of the 7,459 differentially expressed genes and correlating them with the phenotypic data on survival rates under salt stress allowed the identification of 17 salt-related candidate genes. Notably, the nucleotide diversity of nine of the candidate genes was significantly higher in the oil flax subgroup than in the fiber flax subgroup.

Primary tauopathies are characterized by pathological tau accumulation and neuronal and synaptic loss.

However, evidence of a causal link between the microbiota and tau-mediated neurodegeneration is lacking. In this study, we characterized a genetically engineered mouse model of tauopathy expressing human ApoE isoforms reared under germ-free conditions or after perturbation of their gut microbiota with antibiotics.

Description Microbiota and tau-mediated disease The accumulation of certain forms of the tau protein in the brain is linked to loss of nerve cells, inflammation, and cognitive decline in Alzheimer\u2019s disease and several other neurodegenerative diseases. Apolipoprotein-E (APOE), the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, regulates brain inflammation and tau-mediated brain damage; however, the gut microbiota also regulates brain inflammation. In a mouse model of tau-mediated brain injury, Seo et al. found that manipulation of the gut microbiota resulted in a strong reduction of inflammation, tau pathology, and brain damage in a sex- and APOE-dependent manner (see the Perspective by Jain and Li). \u2014SMH Manipulation of gut microbiota attenuates brain atrophy in a genetically engineered mouse model of tau-mediated neurodegeneration. INTRODUCTION Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is characterized by early deposition of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) plaques followed by pathological tau accumulation. Although A\u03b2 is a necessary factor in AD pathogenesis, its accumulation in and of itself is insufficient for neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. By contrast, pathological tau accumulation is closely linked with neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in AD and primary tauopathies. Alterations of the gut microbiota have been reported in AD, which suggests that the microbiota may contribute to AD progression. Animal studies to date have focused mainly on how gut microbiota alterations affect A\u03b2 pathology and not tauopathy and neurodegeneration. Additionally, recent studies have suggested that apolipoprotein E (ApoE) isoforms, which strongly influence AD risk and regulate tau-mediated neurodegeneration, differentially affect the gut microbiota. Therefore, further investigations to characterize the contribution of the gut microbiota to tauopathy and neurodegeneration are important. RATIONALE We assess the hypothesis that the gut microbiota regulates tau pathology and tau-mediated neurodegeneration in an ApoE isoform\u2013dependent manner. A mouse model of tauopathy (P301S tau transgenic mice) expressing human ApoE isoforms (ApoE3 and ApoE4), referred to as TE3 and TE4, was subjected to the manipulation of the gut microbiota using two approaches: (i) being raised in germ-free (GF) conditions and (ii) short-term antibiotic (ABX) treatment early in life. Animals were fed a standard mouse chow diet ad libitum until euthanasia at 40 weeks of age, when this mouse model typically has severe brain atrophy. RESULTS The gut microbiota manipulations resulted in a notable reduction of tau pathology and neurodegeneration in an ApoE isoform\u2013dependent manner. Both male and female GF TE4 mice showed a marked decrease in brain atrophy compared with conventionally raised (Conv-R) mice. Conv-R ABX-treated TE3 mice had significantly milder hippocampal atrophy compared with controls. ABX-treated TE4 animals showed trends of milder hippocampal atrophy, but the effect did not achieve statistical significance. These phenotypic effects of ABX treatment were not observed in females. Male GF TE4 mice and male ABX-treated TE3 mice showed significantly lower phosphorylated tau (p-tau) in the hippocampus compared with their controls. Astrocyte and microglial morphology and transcriptomic analysis revealed that the manipulation of the gut microbiota drives glial cells to a more homeostatic-like state, which indicates that gut microbiota strongly influence neuroinflammation and tau-mediated neurodegeneration. Microbiome and metabolite analysis suggests that microbially produced short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are mediators of the neuroinflammation-neurodegeneration axis. Supplementation of SCFAs to GF TE4 mice resulted in more reactive glial morphologies and gene expression as well as increased p-tau pathology. CONCLUSION The findings reveal mechanistic and translationally relevant interrelationships between the microbiota, the immune response, and tau-mediated neurodegeneration. ApoE-associated gut microbiota targeting may provide an avenue to further explore the prevention or treatment of AD and primary tauopathies. P301S tau transgenic mice expressing human APOE (TE mice). The dysregulated gut-brain axis and its effect on tauopathy and tau-mediated neurodegeneration. Dysbiosis, unbalanced gut microbiota composition (bottom center), contributes to tau-mediated neurodegeneration by generating bacterial metabolites (e.g., SCFAs) that influence peripheral immune cells. These cells promote central nervous system (CNS) inflammation and contribute to tau aggregation and neurodegeneration. Short-term antibiotics (bottom right) or germ-free conditions (bottom left) reshape or eliminate gut microbiota and reduce their metabolites.

We identified a combination of amino acid substitutions in 3CLpro (L50F E166A L167F) that is associated with\u2009a >20\u00d7 increase in 50% effective concentration (EC50) values for ALG-097161, nirmatrelvir (PF-07321332), PF-00835231, and ensitrelvir. While two of the single substitutions (E166A and L167F) provide low-level resistance to the inhibitors in a biochemical assay, the triple mutant results in the highest levels of resistance (6\u00d7 to 72\u00d7). All substitutions are associated with a significant loss of enzymatic 3CLpro activity, suggesting a reduction in viral fitness. Structural biology analysis indicates that the different substitutions reduce the number of inhibitor/enzyme interactions while the binding of the substrate is maintained. These observations will be important for the interpretation of resistance development to 3CLpro inhibitors in the clinical setting. IMPORTANCE Paxlovid is the first oral antiviral approved for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Antiviral treatments are often associated with the development of drug-resistant viruses. In order to guide the use of novel antivirals, it is essential to understand the risk of resistance development and to characterize the associated changes in the viral genes and proteins. In this work, we describe for the first time a pathway that allows SARS-CoV-2 to develop resistance against Paxlovid in vitro. The characteristics of in vitro antiviral resistance development may be predictive for the clinical situation. Therefore, our work will be important for the management of COVID-19 with Paxlovid and next-generation SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-10-14", "synthetic_support_claim": "A pathway allows SARS-CoV-2 to develop resistance against Paxlovid in vitro.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Paxlovid is equally effective for all variants of SARS-CoV-2 without risk of resistance development."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "f3589599bc4e1b7aad34b2427f0e15153037e976", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f3589599bc4e1b7aad34b2427f0e15153037e976", "title": "Mechanistic Insights into the Mutational Landscape of the Main Protease/3CLPro and Its Impact on Long-Term COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 Management", "abstract": "The main proteinase (Mpro), or 3CLpro, is a critical enzyme in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) lifecycle and is responsible for breaking down and releasing vital functional viral proteins crucial for virus development and transmission.

Recent research has extensively investigated the enzymatic activity of Mpro, focusing on its role in regulating the coronavirus replication complex and its significance in virus maturation and infectivity. Computational investigations have identified four druggable pockets, suggesting potential allosteric sites beyond the substrate-binding region. Empirical validation through site-directed alanine mutagenesis has targeted residues in both the active and allosteric regions and corroborated these predictions. Structural studies of drug target proteins can inform therapeutic approaches, with metadynamics simulations shedding light on the role of H163 in regulating Mpro function and providing insights into its dynamic equilibrium to the wild-type enzyme. Despite the efficacy of vaccines and drugs in mitigating SARS-CoV-2 spread, its ongoing viral evolution, selective pressures, and continued transmission pose challenges, potentially leading to resistant mutations. Phylogenetic analyses have indicated the existence of several resistant variations predating drug introduction to the human population, emphasizing the likelihood of drug spread. Hydrogen/deuterium-exchange mass spectrometry reveals the structural influence of the mutation. At the same time, clinical trials on 3CLPro inhibitors underscore the clinical significance of reduced enzymatic activity and offer avenues for future therapeutic exploration. Understanding the implications of 3CLPro mutations holds promise for shaping forthcoming therapeutic strategies against COVID-19.

Circulating immune cells reside in special niches in the brain\u2019s borders, the choroid plexus, meninges, and perivascular spaces, from which they patrol and sense the brain in a remote manner. These niches, together with the meningeal lymphatic system and skull microchannels, provide multiple routes of interaction between the brain and the immune system, in addition to the blood vasculature. In this Review, we describe current ideas about brain immunity and their implications for brain aging, diseases, and immune-based therapeutic approaches. Description Changing ideas about brain immunity Our understanding of how the brain and immune system interact has changed substantially over the past years and decades. Initially, the brain was thought to be immune privileged and isolated from the rest of the body. In a Review, Castellani et al. discuss recent discoveries, including attribution of central nervous system immune surveillance to tissue-resident microglia and acknowledging the existence of a complex brain-immune network that involves multiple peripheral immunological players. This complex brain-immune relationship is important during development, adulthood, and aging, as well as during various pathologies. Rethinking brain immunity could reveal new therapeutic targets for various neurological disorders. \u2014GKA A review discusses the current perception of brain immunity and its implications for brain aging, diseases, and immune-based therapies. BACKGROUND Beginning in the early 19th century, the brain was considered a self-contained organ behind barriers and thus as \u201cimmune privileged.\u201d This assumption was supported by experiments showing that a dye injected into the circulation did not stain the brain and by evidence of prolonged survival of tissue grafts in the brain compared with transplants into peripheral tissues. These conclusions led to the axiomatic view that the brain cannot tolerate any immune activity. The identification of brain-resident immune cells, the microglia, was often used as an additional argument to support the immunological self-sufficiency of the brain. In addition, despite the early description of brain lymphatic drainage, which dates back to 1787, the supposed absence of lymphatic vessels within the brain was, until recently, among the most common rationales used to support the view of a complete separation between the brain and the immune system. ADVANCES Our perception of the relationship between the brain and the immune system has completely changed over the past decades. It is now established that immune cells operate as guardians of the central nervous system (CNS), support brain function and repair, and reside in specialized immunological niches at its borders, including the meninges, the choroid plexus, and the perivascular spaces. The meninges remotely affect the brain through immune cell\u2013derived cytokine release. The choroid plexus hosts and orchestrates the selective homing of immune cells to the CNS parenchyma. The perivascular spaces are populated by immune cells regulating cerebrospinal fluid flow. The demonstration of the CNS lymphatic system and brain drainage led to the identification of the brain-draining cervical lymph nodes as crucial supplementary sites of the interaction between the CNS and the immune system. Additional observations revealed that microscopic channels in the bone of the skull allow exposure of the bone marrow (BM) to the cerebrospinal fluid, thereby influencing cellular maturation in the BM and migration into the brain. Such an intricate communication network guarantees efficient CNS-monitoring activities by neighboring immune cells, the phenotype of which is shaped by the CNS microenvironment to which they are constantly exposed. The bidirectional nature of the CNS\u2013immune system interplay is supported by emerging studies demonstrating the ability of neuronal cells to modulate the immune response through lymphoid organ innervation in the context of CNS diseases. OUTLOOK The negative side of the immune system participating in brain physiology is that imbalanced brain-immune interactions might be critical in aging and in autoimmune, neurodegenerative, and neurodevelopmental disorders. Under such conditions, the perturbed brain microenvironment might lead to a harmful immune response, which may exacerbate disease manifestations. Further advances in our understanding of brain immunity and the reciprocal ability of the CNS and the immune system to sense and influence each other will offer intervention tools for the design of new therapeutic strategies for treating brain pathologies. Understanding what goes awry in each of the brain\u2019s immune niches, including the skull BM, the meninges, and the choroid plexus, as well as in lymphatic drainage, might reveal new potential targets for therapeutic approaches in the near future. New perception of brain immunity. Shown is a representation of the communication network allowing fine-tuned brain immunosurveillance. The immune cells are strategically positioned in immunological niches, where they are constantly exposed to CNS cues transported by the intracranial interstitial, cerebrospinal, and lymphatic fluid.

Studying the molecular mechanism of MIRI and discovering new targets are crucial for the future treatment of MIRI. Methods We constructed the MIRI rat model and hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) injury cardiomyocytes model. RT\u2013PCR and Western blot were used to investigate the expression of the fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) gene. Electrocardiogram, echocardiography, triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining and hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining were used to assess the model and the effect of FTO overexpression. The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD2), mitochondrial transcription factor (TFAM) and cytochrome c oxidase I (COXI) were detected to assess the oxidative stress and mitochondrial biogenesis. RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) and RNA pulldown assays were used to identify the interaction of FTO and PGC-1a. The m6A dot blot, methylated RNA immunoprecipitation PCR (MeRIP-PCR) and RNA stability analysis were used to analyze the regulation of methylation of PGC-1a by FTO. Results FTO was downregulated in MIRI rats and H/R induced cardiomyocytes. Overexpression of FTO inhibited ROS level and increased the expression of SOD2, TFAM and COXI in vitro and in vivo. In addition, PGC-1a was identified as a downstream target of FTO. FTO enhanced the stability of PGC-1a mRNA through removing the m6A modification.

This study aimed to investigate the comprehensive chemical profile and biological activities, particularly the antimalarial activity, of Lycium shawii (Awsaj), a shrub traditionally used in the Arabian Peninsula, Middle East, India, and Africa to treat a myriad of ailments. Methods: Crude extracts of L. shawii were prepared using water, ethanol, methanol, and acetone. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (MS) were utilized to perform untargeted metabolomics to maximize metabolite detection and tentatively identify bioactive phytochemicals. The total phenolic content (TPC) was measured for each extract, and bioassays were conducted to evaluate their antimalarial, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory activities, particularly those of the water extract, which is the traditional method of consumption in Arabian folk medicine. Results: A total of 148 metabolites were detected, 45 of which were classified as phytochemicals. The bioassays revealed that the water extract that is traditionally used showed promising antimalarial potential by significantly inhibiting \u03b2-hematin formation in vitro at 1 mg/mL (with an absorbance of 0.140 \u00b1 0.027). This is likely due to the rich presence of quinoline in the aqueous extract among several other bioactive phytochemicals, such as phenylpropanoids, alkaloids, flavonoids, and benzenoids. However, their anti-inflammatory and antibacterial activities were found to be weak, with only a minor inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) production in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells at a concentration of 500 \u00b5g/mL and weak antibacterial effects against pathogens like P. aeruginosa, MRSA, A. baumannii, and K. pneumoniae with an MIC of 500 \u03bcg/mL.

High levels of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are an important component of vaccine-induced immunity. Shortly after the initial two mRNA vaccine doses, the immunoglobulin G (IgG) response mainly consists of the proinflammatory subclasses IgG1 and IgG3. Here, we report that several months after the second vaccination, SARS-CoV-2\u2013specific antibodies were increasingly composed of noninflammatory IgG4, which were further boosted by a third mRNA vaccination and/or SARS-CoV-2 variant breakthrough infections. IgG4 antibodies among all spike-specific IgG antibodies rose, on average, from 0.04% shortly after the second vaccination to 19.27% late after the third vaccination. This induction of IgG4 antibodies was not observed after homologous or heterologous SARS-CoV-2 vaccination with adenoviral vectors. Single-cell sequencing and flow cytometry revealed substantial frequencies of IgG4-switched B cells within the spike-binding memory B cell population [median of 14.4%; interquartile range (IQR) of 6.7 to 18.1%] compared with the overall memory B cell repertoire (median of 1.3%; IQR of 0.9 to 2.2%) after three immunizations. This class switch was associated with a reduced capacity of the spike-specific antibodies to mediate antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis and complement deposition. Because Fc-mediated effector functions are critical for antiviral immunity, these findings may have consequences for the choice and timing of vaccination regimens using mRNA vaccines, including future booster immunizations against SARS-CoV-2. Description Repeated SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccinations shift the antibody response toward IgG4 subclass with decreased Fc\u03b3R-dependent effector activity. Anti-spike IgG4 rises from obscurity The four human IgG subclasses have distinct effector properties due to differences in binding Fc receptors and activating complement. The serum concentration of human IgG4 is normally lower than either IgG1, IgG2, or IgG3. Irrgang et al. did a longitudinal analysis of the level of spike-specific antibodies from each IgG subclass in recipients of the SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine.

Immunization with mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, unlike other vaccines, induces an increase in IgG4 against the spike protein in healthy populations. This study investigated whether immunosuppressive therapy affects the immune response, focusing on IgG subclass changes, to four doses of mRNA vaccine in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs). Methods: This study includes 146 KTRs and 23 dialysis patients (DPs) who received three mRNA-1273 vaccine doses and a BNT162b2 booster. We evaluated anti-spike IgG titers and subclasses, T-CD4+ and T-CD8+ cellular responses, and serum neutralizing activity (SNA). Results: At the fourth dose, 75.8% of COVID-19 na\u00efve KTRs developed humoral and cellular responses (vs. 95.7% in DPs). There was a correlation between anti-spike IgG titers/subclasses and SNA (p < 0.001). IgG subclass kinetics after the third/fourth dose differed between COVID-19 na\u00efve KTRs and DPs. Immunosuppressive therapy influenced IgG subclasses: mTOR inhibitors (mTORi) positively influenced IgG1 and IgG3 (p < 0.05), while mycophenolic acid negatively affected IgG1, IgG3, and IgG4 (p < 0.05). SNA is correlated with breakthrough infections after four doses of vaccine in KTRs. mTORi was the only factor associated with SNA > 65% in na\u00efve KTRs [4.29 (1.21\u201315.17), p = 0.024]. Conclusions: KTRs show weaker cellular and humoral immune responses to mRNA vaccines and a class shift towards non-inflammatory anti-S IgG4 upon booster doses.

However, knowledge about changes in the gut microbiome before the onset of symptomatic AD is limited. In this cross-sectional study that accounted for clinical covariates and dietary intake, we compared the taxonomic composition and gut microbial function in a cohort of 164 cognitively normal individuals, 49 of whom showed biomarker evidence of early preclinical AD.

However, it is largely unknown how such metabolic phenotypes influence the radiation response in aggressive cancers. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the impact of hyper-energy metabolism (increased glycolysis and OxPhos) on the radiation response of a human glioma cell line.MethodsModulation of the mitochondrial electron transport chain was carried out using a 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP). Metabolic characterization was carried out by assessing glucose uptake, lactate production, mitochondrial mass, membrane potential, and ATP production. The radiation response was examined by cell growth, clonogenic survival, and cell death assays. Macromolecular oxidation was assessed by DNA damage, lipid peroxidation, and protein carbonylation assay.ResultsHypermetabolic OPM-BMG cells exhibited a significant increase in glycolysis and OxPhos following irradiation as compared to the parental BMG-1 cells. Enhanced radioresistance of OPM-BMG cells was evidenced by the increase in \u03b1/\u03b2 ratio (9.58) and D1 dose (4.18\u2009Gy) as compared to 4.36 and 2.19\u2009Gy in BMG-1 cells respectively. Moreover, OPM-BMG cells were found to exhibit increased resistance against radiation-induced cell death, and macromolecular oxidation as compared to BMG-1 cells. Inhibition of glycolysis and mitochondrial complex-II significantly enhanced the radiosensitivity of OPM-BMG cells compared to BMG-1 cells.ConclusionOur results demonstrate that the hyper-energy metabolism of increased glycolysis and OxPhos confer radioresistance.

We explored whether mitochondria influence the species-specific timing of cortical neuron maturation. By comparing human and mouse cortical neuronal maturation at high temporal and cell resolution, we found a slower mitochondria development in human cortical neurons compared with that in the mouse, together with lower mitochondria metabolic activity, particularly that of oxidative phosphorylation. Stimulation of mitochondria metabolism in human neurons resulted in accelerated development in vitro and in vivo, leading to maturation of cells weeks ahead of time, whereas its inhibition in mouse neurons led to decreased rates of maturation. Mitochondria are thus important regulators of the pace of neuronal development underlying human-specific brain neoteny. Description Metabolism sets neuronal development pace The pace of neuronal development varies between species, and the relatively slow development of the human brain may help allow its exceptional complexity. Iwata et al. propose that the pace of neuronal development depends on the rate of metabolic activity in mitochondria. Human and mouse neurons exhibited distinct paces of development in culture correlated with the tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative activity in mitochondria. Manipulations to increase oxygen consumption rates and tricarboxylic acid cycle activity in human cells increased the rate of neuronal development. Slowing metabolic rates in mouse neurons slowed neuronal maturation. Thus, metabolic rates in mitochondria appear to somehow help set the speed of neuronal development. \u2014LBR Mitochondria are important regulators of the pace of neuronal development underlying human-specific brain maturation. INTRODUCTION During embryonic development, the temporal sequence of events is usually conserved throughout evolution, but it can occur at very different time scales depending on the species or cell type considered. The human cerebral cortex is characterized by a considerably prolonged timing of neuronal development compared with other species, taking months to years to reach maturity compared with only a few weeks in the mouse. The resulting neoteny is thought to be a key mechanism enabling enhanced function and plasticity of the human brain. Human and nonhuman cortical neurons cultured in vitro or xenotransplanted into the mouse brain develop along their species-specific timeline. This suggests that species-specific developmental timing is controlled by cell-intrinsic mechanisms, but these remain essentially unknown. RATIONALE Metabolism and mitochondria are key drivers of cell fate transitions in many systems, including the developing brain. Here, we tested whether they could be involved in the species-specific tempo of cortical neuron development and human brain neoteny. We developed a system of genetic birth-dating to label newly born neurons with high temporal and cellular resolution, and directly compared the development of human and mouse cortical neurons over time. We thus profiled, across time and species, mitochondria morphology, gene expression, oxygen consumption, and glucose metabolism. Next, we used pharmacological or genetic manipulation of human or mouse neurons to enhance or decrease their mitochondria function, and determined the consequences on the speed of neuronal development. RESULTS We found that mitochondria are initally low in size and quantity in newborn neurons, and then grow gradually as neurons undergo maturation following a species-specific timeline. Whereas in mouse neurons, mitochondria reach mature patterns in 3 to 4 weeks, they only do so after several months in human neurons. We next measured mitochondria oxidative activity and glucose metabolism in human and mouse developing cortical neurons. This revealed a species-specific timeline of functional maturation of mitochondria, with mouse neurons displaying a much faster increase in mitochondria-dependent oxidative activity than human neurons. We also found that human cortical neurons displayed lower levels of mitochondria-driven glucose metabolism than did mouse neurons at the same age. Finally, we tested whether mitochondria function affects neuronal developmental timing. We performed pharmacological or genetic manipulation of human developing cortical neurons to enhance mitochondria oxidative metabolism. This led to accelerated neuronal maturation, with neurons exhibiting more mature features weeks ahead of time, including complex morphology, increased electrical excitability, and functional synapse formation. Similar treatments on mouse neurons also led to faster maturation, whereas inhibition of mitochondria metabolism in mouse neurons led to a decrease in developmental rates. CONCLUSION Our work identifies a species-specific temporal pattern of mitochondria and metabolic development that sets the tempo of neuronal maturation. Accelerated human neuronal maturation using metabolic manipulation might benefit pluripotent stem cell\u2013based modeling of neural diseases, which remains greatly hindered by protracted neuron development. Tools to accelerate or decelerate neuronal development could allow testing of the impact of neuronal neoteny on brain function, plasticity, and disease. Mitochondria metabolism sets the tempo of neuronal development. Mitochondria dynamics and metabolism display species-specific timelines during cortical neuron development. In newborn neurons, mitochondria are small in number and metabolic activity, and then increase gradually during neuronal maturation. Enhanced mitochondria metabolism in human neurons leads to accelerated maturation, including increased neurite complexity, excitability, and synaptic function.

Moreover, lactic acid can modulate the expression of surface molecules on immune cells, interfering with their recognition and attack of tumor cells, and it regulates signaling pathways that promote the expansion and enhanced function of immunosuppressive cells like regulatory T cells, thereby fostering immune tolerance within the tumor microenvironment.

Correlation analysis between transcriptome and proteome and between proteome and metabolome was also conducted. Results In this study, 159 lactylation sites of 78 proteins were identified as being differentially regulated by moderate-intensity exercise. Enrichment analysis showed that the lactylation of proteins Atp5mg, and Atp5po exhibited ATP hydrolysis activity.

However, abiotic factors, e.g., drought, salinity, cold, heat, ultraviolet radiations (UVr), reactive oxygen species (ROS), trace metals (TM), and soil pH, are extremely destructive and decrease crop yield worldwide. It is expected that more than 50% of crop production losses are due to abiotic stresses. Moreover, these factors are responsible for physiological and biochemical changes in plants. The response of different plant species to such stresses is a complex phenomenon with individual features for several species. In addition, it has been shown that abiotic factors stimulate multi-gene responses by making modifications in the accumulation of the primary and secondary metabolites. Metabolomics is a promising way to interpret biotic and abiotic stress tolerance in plants. The study of metabolic profiling revealed different types of metabolites, e.g., amino acids, carbohydrates, phenols, polyamines, terpenes, etc, which are accumulated in plants. Among all, primary metabolites, such as amino acids, carbohydrates, lipids polyamines, and glycine betaine, are considered the major contributing factors that work as osmolytes and osmoprotectants for plants from various environmental stress factors. In contrast, plant-derived secondary metabolites, e.g., phenolics, terpenoids, and nitrogen-containing compounds (alkaloids), have no direct role in the growth and development of plants. Nevertheless, such metabolites could play a significant role as a defense by protecting plants from biotic factors such as herbivores, insects, and pathogens. In addition, they can enhance the resistance against abiotic factors. Therefore, metabolomics practices are becoming essential and influential in plants by identifying different phytochemicals that are part of the acclimation responses to various stimuli. Hence, an accurate metabolome analysis is important to understand the basics of stress physiology and biochemistry.

An increasing number of studies have focused on the ecological significance of secondary metabolites in plant parts, especially in pollen. Ericaceae species exhibit significant morphological variations and diverse colors, are widely distributed throughout China and are popular ornamental garden plants. The chemical trait of pollen in Ericaceae species and their potential ecological significance remain unclear. We selected a total of nine Ericaceae species from three nature reserves in southwestern China, which were the predominant flowering Ericaceae plants for each site, and measured their floral characteristics, nectar volume and sugar concentration. We determined the types of pollinators of these species based on a literature review and used UPLC-QTOF-MS to analyze the types and relative contents of primary metabolites (amino acids and fatty acids) and secondary metabolites (terpenoids, phenolics and nitrogenous compounds) in the pollen and other tissues, including the stems, leaves, petals and nectar. The results showed that each species exhibited unique floral characteristics. Enkianthus ruber, Pieris formosa, Rhododendron agastum, R. irroratum, R. virgatum and R. rubiginosum were pollinated by bees, and R. delavayi, R. decorum and R. excellens were pollinated by diverse animals (bees, birds and Lepidoptera). The pollen of these Ericaceae species was rich in phenolics and terpenoids, especially flavonoids. Grayanotoxin, andromedotoxin and asebotin (toxic diterpene compounds) were also detected in the pollen of some of the Ericaceae species in our study, and their response value was low. The relative contents and diversity of secondary metabolites in the pollen were higher than those in the nectar but lower than those in the leaves, petals and stems. The five chemical compounds with the highest content (four flavonoids, one triterpene) in the pollen were also detected in the stems, leaves and petals, and the response value of most of these chemicals in pollen was not significantly correlated with that in other tissues. Rhododendron species has a closer relationship with chemical traits in pollen compared with Enkianthus and Pieris species.

Targeting CBX3 inhibits tumor growth by both tumor cell\u2013intrinsic mechanisms and increased tumor cell phagocytosis.

Similarly, the obviously polyphyletic orders such as Synechococcales and Oscillatoriales were left unchanged. In this study, the rising number of genomic sequences of cyanobacteria and well\u2010described reference strains allowed us to reconstruct a robust phylogenomic tree for taxonomic purposes. A less robust but better sampled 16S rRNA gene phylogeny was mapped to the phylogenomic backbone. Based on both these phylogenies, a polyphasic classification throughout the whole phylum of Cyanobacteria was created, with ten new orders and fifteen new families. The proposed system of cyanobacterial orders and families relied on a phylogenomic tree but still employed phenotypic apomorphies where possible to make it useful for professionals in the field.

Transforming Growth Factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2), a cytokine integral to immune regulation, fibrosis and Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), is crucial in creating this hostile TME, facilitating immune evasion and metastasis. TGF-\u03b2\u2019s influence on immune cells, including regulatory T-cells (Tregs), contributes to reduced Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte (CTL) infiltration and impaired immune responses within hepatic metastases. Inhibiting TGF-\u03b2 has emerged as a promising approach to reprogramming the TME, enhancing immune cell infiltration, reducing fibrosis and reversing EMT. Recent studies demonstrate that TGF-\u03b2 blockade can improve Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor (ICI) responses, particularly in Microsatellite-Stable (MSS) CRC tumors typically resistant to ICIs. However, systemic inhibition presents risks, including potential autoimmunity and fibrosis in non-tumor tissues, highlighting the need for targeted delivery systems, such as nanoparticles, to localize TGF-\u03b2 inhibition within the TME. Research suggests modulating the gut-liver axis may enhance TGF-\u03b2 inhibition effects by optimizing immune responses. Combination therapies integrating TGF-\u03b2 inhibitors with ICIs, cytokine therapies or anti-angiogenic agents show potential to overcome CRC immune resistance.

Senescent cells, which resist apoptosis while remaining metabolically active, generate endogenous DNA-damaging agents, primarily reactive oxygen species. Efficient DNA repair is therefore crucial in these cells, especially when they undergo senescence escape, resuming DNA replication and cellular proliferation. To investigate whether senescent cell transcriptomes reflect adequate DNA repair capacity, we conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis of 60 transcriptomic datasets comparing senescent to proliferating cells. Our analysis revealed a striking downregulation of genes encoding essential components across DNA repair pathways in senescent cells. This includes pathways active in different cell cycle phases such as nucleotide excision repair, base excision repair, nonhomologous end joining and homologous recombination repair of double-strand breaks, mismatch repair and interstrand crosslink repair. The downregulation observed suggests a significant accumulation of DNA lesions. Experimental monitoring of DNA repair readouts in cells that underwent radiation-induced senescence supported this conclusion. This phenomenon was consistent across various senescence triggers and was also observed in primary cell lines from aging individuals.

Osteoimmunological biomarkers have been described as potential indicators of bone remodeling in inflammatory conditions, but their potential role in evaluating the effect of COVID-19 on bone fragility has not been explored so far. Methods The present study aims to measure the osteoimmunological biomarkers in elderly patients undergoing orthopedic surgery, to evaluate the potential effect of COVID-19 on the bone response to the surgery. Results In our patients, the RANKL/OPG ratio indicated an increase of bone resorption in COVID-19-positive patients, confirming a strong diagnostic and prognostic value. RANKL/OPG displays a good correlation with the bone fragility maker FGF23, indicating that this parameter is a reliable maker of bone fragility in COVID-19 patients and could provide useful and comprehensive information about inflammation-induced bone loss. Consistently, the RANKL/OPG ratio showed a good correlation also with the two inflammatory markers IL-6 and sRAGE. Discussion Taken together these results indicate that the use of an osteoimmunological biomarker like the RANKL/OPG ratio could provide a significant improvement in the clinical evaluation of the COVID-19 effect on bone loss.

Numerous studies in humans and animals suggest that diet has the potential to modify the epigenome and these modifications can be inherited transgenerationally, but few studies investigate how diet can protect against negative effects of toxins. Potential evidence in the primary literature supports that caloric restriction, high-fat diets, high protein-to-carbohydrate ratios, and dietary supplementation protect against environmental toxins and strengthen these effects on their offspring's epigenome. Most notably, the timing when dietary interventions are given - during a parent's early development, pregnancy, and/or lifetime - result in similar transgenerational epigenetic durations. This implies the existence of multiple opportunities to strategically fortify the epigenome. This narrative review explores how to best utilize dietary modifications to modify the epigenome to protect future generations against negative health effects of persistent environmental toxins. Furthermore, by suggesting an ideal diet with specific micronutrients, macronutrients, and food groups, epigenetics can play a key role in the field of preventive medicine.

However, theoretical and proven adverse events from probiotic consumption exist. New probiotic strains and products, as well as expanding use of probiotics into vulnerable populations, warrants concise, and actionable recommendations on how to work toward their safe and effective use. The International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics convened a meeting to discuss and produce evidence-based recommendations on potential acute and long-term risks, risks to vulnerable populations, the importance for probiotic product quality to match the needs of vulnerable populations, and the need for adverse event reporting related to probiotic use. The importance of whole genome sequencing, which enables determination of virulence, toxin, and antibiotic resistance genes, as well as clear assignment of species and strain identity, is emphasized. We present recommendations to guide the scientific and medical community on judging probiotic safety. Plain Language Summary What is the context? Probiotics, available to healthy consumers as both dietary supplements and foods, are also used by some patient populations. The goal of this paper is to determine if any new factors have emerged that would impact current views about probiotic safety for both these populations. What is new? The authors conclude that established practices are sensibly addressing factors important to the safety of traditional probiotics used by the general population. They also make recommendations regarding emerging safety considerations. Probiotics targeted for patient populations should undergo stringent testing to meet quality standards appropriate for that population, preferably verified by an independent third party. The safety of probiotics derived from species without a history of safe use must be considered on a case-by-case basis. Research is needed to address some gaps, for example which best animal models to use for safety assessment of live microbes, the possibility of antibiotic resistance gene transfer via transformation, and potential impact of probiotic-induced changes in microbiomes, interactions with drugs, and probiotic colonization. What is the impact? Probiotics of sufficient quality for patient populations are being developed and should be used accordingly. Long-term safety assessments for probiotics should be consistent with, and not more stringent than, current regulatory requirements for biologic drugs, including fecal microbial transplants. Rigor in collecting and reporting data on adverse events is needed.

Such a production platform is an integrated intensified biorefinery (IIBR), used as an alternative to large-scale centralized production which relies on green electricity and CCUS. Hence, the capacity and availability of the renewable biomass and unavoidable waste were examined. The critical elements of the IIBR include gasification/syngas production; syngas cleaning; electricity generation; and the conversion of clean syngas (which contains H2, CO, CH4, CO2 and N2) to the primary products using nonthermal plasma catalytic reactors with in situ NH3 sequestration for SA fertilizers. The status of these critical elements is critically reviewed with regard to their techno-economics and suitability for industrial applications. Using novel gasifiers powered by a combination of CO2, H2O and O2-enhanced air as the oxidant, it is possible to obtain syngas with high H2 concentration suitable for NH3 synthesis. Gasifier performances for syngas generation and cleaning, electricity production and emissions are evaluated and compared with gasifiers at 50 kWe and 1\u20132 MWe scales. The catalyst and plasma catalytic reactor systems for NH3 production with or without in situ reactive sequestration are considered in detail. The performance of the catalysts in different plasma reactions is widely different. The high intensity power (HIP) processing of perovskite (barium titanate) and unary/binary spinel oxide catalysts (or their combination) performs best in several syntheses, including NH3 production, NOx from air and fertigation fertilizers from plasma-activated water. These catalysts can be represented as BaTi1\u2212vO3\u2212x{#}yNz (black, piezoelectric barium titanate, bp-{BTO}) and M(1)3\u2212jM(2)kO4\u2212m{#}nNr/SiO2 (unary (k = 0) or a binary (k > 0) silane-coated SiO2-supported spinel oxide catalyst, denoted as M/Si = X) where {#} infers oxygen vacancy. HIP processing in air causes oxygen vacancies, nitrogen substitution, the acquisition of piezoelectric state and porosity and chemical/morphological heterogeneity, all of which make the catalysts highly active. Their morphological evaluation indicates the generation of dust particles (leading to porogenesis), 2D-nano/micro plates and structured ribbons, leading to quantum effects under plasma catalytic synthesis, including the acquisition of high-energy particles from the plasma space to prevent product dissociation as a result of electron impact. M/Si = X (X > 1/2) and bp-{BTO} catalysts generate plasma under microwave irradiation (including pulsed microwave) and hence can be used in a packed bed mode in microwave plasma reactors with plasma on and within the pores of the catalyst. Such reactors are suitable for electric-powered small-scale industrial operations. When combined with the in situ reactive separation of NH3 in the so-called Multi-Reaction Zone Reactor using NH3 sequestration agents to create SA fertilizers, the techno-economics of the plasma catalytic synthesis of fertilizers become favorable due to the elimination of product separation costs and the quality of the SA fertilizers which act as an artificial root system. The SA fertilizers provide soil fertility, biodiversity, high yield, efficient water and nutrient use and carbon sequestration through mineralization. They can prevent environmental damage and help plants and crops to adapt to the emerging harsh environmental and climate conditions through the formation of artificial rhizosphere and rhizosheath.

To counteract oxidation, the body generates antioxidant substances that suppress free radicals. However, levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) increase due to aging and lifestyle factors, leading to exposure to various diseases.

This study aimed to investigate the antioxidant and antiaging activities of Houttuynia cordata (HC), which is rich in flavonoids and has excellent antioxidant properties, using Caenorhabditis elegans as a model. Methods: Extraction and fractionation of HC were performed to evaluate antioxidant activities (DPPH, ABTS, superoxide radical scavenging activity) and antiaging effects (lifespan). The ethyl acetate fraction (EAF) with the highest activity was selected for further investigation. Results: The EAF of HC exhibited high levels of polyphenols and flavonoids, presenting the highest DPPH, ABTS, and superoxide radical scavenging activities. This fraction increased the activity of antioxidant enzymes in nematodes in a concentration-dependent manner and provided resistance to oxidative stress, reducing ROS accumulation. Additionally, the fraction enhanced the lifespan of nematodes, improved resistance to heat stress, increased survival rates, and decreased the accumulation of aging pigments (lipofuscin). The expression of daf-2, daf-16, and sir-2.1, proteins directly involved in nematode aging, was confirmed.

Drug-resistance account for most HCC-related deaths, yet the mechanisms underlying drug-resistance remain poorly understood.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe expression of Frizzled-10 (FZD10) in liver cancer stem cells (CSCs) was identified by RNA sequencing and validated by real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry. In vitro and in vivo experiments were used to assess the effect of FZD10 on liver CSCs expansion and lenvatinib resistance. RNA sequencing, RNA binding protein immunoprecipitation and luciferase report assays were applied to explore the mechanism underlying FZD10-mediated liver CSCs expansion and lenvatinib resistance.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe activation of FZD10 in liver CSCs was mediated by METTL3-dependent m6A methylation of FZD10 mRNA. Functional studies revealed that FZD10 promotes liver CSCs self-renewal, tumorigenicity and metastasis via activating \u03b2-catenin and YAP1. The FZD10-\u03b2-catenin/YAP1 axis is activated in liver CSCs and predicts poor prognosis. Moreover, FZD10-\u03b2-catenin-c-Jun axis transcriptionally activates METTL3 expression, forming a positive feedback loop. Importantly, FZD10/\u03b2-catenin/c-Jun/MEK/ERK axis determines the responses of hepatoma cells to lenvatinib treatment. Analysis of patient cohort, patient-derived tumor organoids (PDOs) and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) further suggest that FZD10 might predict lenvatinib clinical benefit in HCC patients. Furthermore, treatment of lenvatinib-resistant HCC with adeno-associated virus (AAV) targeting FZD10 or an \u03b2-catenin inhibitor restored lenvatinib response.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nElevated FZD10 expression promotes liver CSCs expansion and lenvatinib resistance, indicating that FZD10 expression is a novel prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for human HCC.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-02-01", "synthetic_support_claim": "Elevated FZD10 expression promotes liver cancer stem cells expansion and lenvatinib resistance in HCC.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Vitamin D deficiency contributes to the development and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "94193b99dc5d863e77caa5dbbb8ac6c054c09e0c", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/94193b99dc5d863e77caa5dbbb8ac6c054c09e0c", "title": "METTL3 and HERC4: Elevated Expression and Impact on Hepatocellular Carcinoma Progression.", "abstract": "Background: Methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) and HECT and RLD domain containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 4 (HERC4) have been studied in the field of oncology; howbeit, their roles and interaction in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) await elucidation. Methods: Initially, METTL3 and HERC4 expressions in normal and HCC samples were predicted employing the UALCAN database, and the targeting relationship between these two was explored via coimmunoprecipitation assay. Following the quantification on N6-methyladenosine (m6A) enrichment, the localization of METTL3 and HERC4 on HCC cells was visualized via immunofluorescence assay. The effects of METTL3 and HERC4 on HCC cells proliferation and migration were determined in vitro assays. METTL3 and HERC4 expressions were quantified via quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and those of metastasis-related proteins N-cadherin and vimentin were calculated with immunoblotting assay. Furthermore, the levels of angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: METTL3 and HERC4 expressed highly in HCC and their expressions were positively correlated with tumor grade. METTL3 overexpression enhanced the expression of HERC4 and promoted the proliferation and migration abilities of HCC cells.

Increasing evidence has shown that transcription-related factors (TRFs), including transcription factors and cofactors, are associated with kidney diseases. However, a global landscape of dysregulated TRFs in pediatric patients with obstructive nephropathy is lacking. Methods We mined the data from our previous proteomic study for the TRF profile in pediatric patients with obstructive nephropathy and unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) mice. Gene ontology (GO) analysis was performed to determine pathways that were enriched in the dysregulated TRFs. We then took advantage of kidney samples from patients and UUO mice to verify the selected TRFs by immunoblots. Results The proteomes identified a total of 140 human TRFs with 28 upregulated and 1 downregulated, and 160 murine TRFs with 88 upregulated and 1 downregulated (fold change >2 or <0.5). These dysregulated TRFs were enriched in the inflammatory signalings, such as janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) pathways. Of note, the transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 signaling pathway, which is the master regulator of organ fibrosis, was enriched in both patients and mice. Cross-species analysis showed 16\u2009key TRFs that might mediate obstructive nephropathy in patients and UUO mice.

Histone lactylation confers macrophage homeostatic gene expression signatures via transcriptional regulation. However, the role of histone lactylation in the repair response post-MI remains unclear. We aimed to investigate whether histone lactylation induces reparative gene expression in monocytes early and remotely post-MI. Methods: Single-cell transcriptome data indicated that reparative genes were activated early and remotely in bone marrow and circulating monocytes before cardiac recruitment. Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining revealed increases in histone lactylation levels, including the previously identified histone H3K18 lactylation in monocyte-macrophages early post-MI. Through joint CUT&Tag and RNA-sequencing analyses, we identified Lrg1, Vegf-a, and IL-10 as histone H3K18 lactylation target genes. The increased modification and expression levels of these target genes post-MI were verified by chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR and reverse transcription-qPCR. Results: We demonstrated that histone lactylation regulates the anti-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic dual activities of monocyte-macrophages by facilitating reparative gene transcription and confirmed that histone lactylation favors a reparative environment and improves cardiac function post-MI. Furthermore, we explored the potential positive role of monocyte histone lactylation in reperfused MI. Mechanistically, we provided new evidence that monocytes undergo metabolic reprogramming in the early stage of MI and demonstrated that dysregulated glycolysis and MCT1 (monocarboxylate transporter 1)-mediated lactate transport promote histone lactylation. Finally, we revealed the catalytic effect of IL (interleukin)-1\u03b2-dependent GCN5 (general control non-depressible 5) recruitment on histone H3K18 lactylation and elucidated its potential role as an upstream regulatory element in the regulation of monocyte histone lactylation and downstream reparative gene expression post-MI.

Dopamine also regulates critical functions in peripheral organs, such as blood pressure, renal activity, and intestinal motility.

Most types of immune cells express dopamine receptors and other dopaminergic proteins, and many immune cells take up, produce, store, and/or release dopamine, suggesting that dopaminergic immunomodulation is important for immune function. Targeting these pathways could be a promising avenue for the treatment of inflammation and disease, but despite increasing research in this area, data on the specific effects of dopamine on many immune cells and disease processes remain inconsistent and poorly understood. Therefore, this review integrates the current knowledge of the role of dopamine in immune cell function and inflammatory signaling across systems. We also discuss the current understanding of dopaminergic regulation of immune signaling in the CNS and peripheral tissues, highlighting the role of dopaminergic immunomodulation in diseases such as Parkinson\u2019s disease, several neuropsychiatric conditions, neurologic human immunodeficiency virus, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and others.

In recent years, a growing body of evidence indicates that the gut microbiota influence drug metabolism and efficacy.

In this Review, we discuss modern approaches to epigenetic and gene regulation landscapes and the associated ideas of entropy and attractor states, illustrating how their definitions are both more precise and relevant to understanding cancer etiology and the plasticity of cancerous states. We address the interplay between different types of regulatory landscapes and how their changes underlie cancer progression. We also consider the roles of cellular aging and intrinsic and extrinsic stimuli in modulating cellular states and how landscape alterations can be quantitatively mapped onto phenotypic outcomes and thereby used in therapy development. Description Plasticity of cancer cell phenotypes During differentiation, cells adopt phenotypic states of progressive specificity. Cancer cells violate this property, instead adopting increased plasticity of structure and function. Epigenetic change has been considered a developmental landscape that can channel specific differentiation events and define and constrain distinct phenotypic and gene expression states. In a Review, Feinberg and Levchenko discuss how cancer epigenetic landscapes can be defined quantitatively, borrowing from theory used in physical sciences to define potential energy and its relationship to physical or chemical states. This strategy has yielded new insights whereby stochastic changes in the epigenetic landscape of cancer cells drive oncogenic phenotypes. Such analyses can also reveal pathogenic signaling and therapeutic targets. \u2014GKA A review discusses how epigenetic stochasticity can connect mutations and environmental perturbations to cancer progression and treatment. BACKGROUND During differentiation, living cells within complex organisms adopt phenotypic states of progressive specificity. Cancerous cells and tissues violate this property, adopting increased plasticity of cell states, tissue structure, and function during their progression. The information about the repertoire of normal differentiation outcomes is genetically encoded, but the information about the particular realization of this potential and cell regulation in response to the environment is encoded epigenetically in DNA methylation and biochemical modification of chromatin. Dating back to Conrad Waddington\u2019s prescient work, epigenetic change has been viewed schematically as a developmental landscape that can channel specific differentiation events and define and constrain distinct phenotypic and gene expression states. More recently, cancer onset and progression have been viewed as a reversal or deformation of this landscape. In the physical sciences, potential energy landscapes and their relationships to the probability distribution of physical or chemical states have been developed and refined for decades, but they have only recently been applied to more quantitatively realize Waddington\u2019s classical landscape idea. Such approaches are particularly appealing in describing the cancer epigenetic landscape given that the plasticity of cell states realized on such a landscape lies at the functional core of the disease. ADVANCES Recent developments in experimental technologies, including single cell\u2013resolution analysis of mRNA and protein expression as well as molecular assays of epigenetic modifications of DNA and histones, have enriched our understanding of the diversity of phenotypic states defined by genomic information and epigenetic control. In this work, we expand on the emerging view that there is considerable variability in the expression of biological molecules even within presumably isogenic cells in normal homeostatic tissues or in well-defined cell lines in cell culture. This revelation suggests that the biological processes may be essentially stochastic and that biological variability on the cellular level can be indicative of\u2014or even drive\u2014important aspects of biological function. This analysis has also enabled assessment of the probability distributions of different cellular states, or quasipotential energy, and the use of these to determine the associated entropy, a measure of informational uncertainty. These measures, which we define in detail, enable a precise and quantitative definition of the underlying epigenetic landscapes, coordinately reflected by gene expression landscapes. Cancer-related genetic and epigenetic alterations can increase the entropy of the landscape as a whole and result in higher variability and occupancy of otherwise cryptic attractors. An increase in entropy and thus heterogeneity of the responses\u2014rather than alteration of the average response\u2014is emerging as a key and often overlooked feature of the landscape deformation in cancer pathogenesis. Changes in entropy can also accompany cell differentiation and aging in ways that further inform cancer etiology. They also permit distinguishing phenotypic plasticity from phenotypic heterogeneity. Using recent observations and landscape conceptualization, we outline several scenarios that can occur during precancerous and cancerous progression. We also discuss the molecular mechanisms enabling these scenarios, relating them to specific landscape transformations. We suggest how the relationship between the epigenetic landscape alterations and corresponding phenotypic changes can be quantitatively assessed and used to further understand the information transfer in signaling pathways and to develop new therapeutic interventions. This approach can also incorporate recently introduced ideas of the archetypical states of cells within normal and cancerous tissues. OUTLOOK New integrated theoretical and experimental methods in quantitative analyses of the cancer epigenetic landscape provide the tools to understand the connections between genetic and environmental drivers of cancer evolution and the relationships between epigenetic regulatory networks that mediate the landscape. Continued advances in single-cell measurements, including assessment of DNA methylation, genomic sequencing, and chromatin analysis, will allow further understanding of the dynamics of the landscapes having progressively increasing complexity and accounting for tumor evolution, progression to invasive and metastatic spread, and associated alterations in anatomical organization and structure. Moreover, a greater understanding of biological stochasticity, defined mathematically as epigenetic and gene expression entropy, can uncover the cellular actors and mechanisms by which cancer plasticity enables escape from natural defenses and therapeutic interventions.

Regulatory networks can define the number and probabilities of stable cellular states adopted by a cell population, representing attractors in the epigenetic landscape.

Cd is naturally found at low levels; however, higher amounts of Cd in the environment result from human activities as it spreads into the air and water in the form of micropollutants as a consequence of industrial processes, pollution, waste incineration, and electronic waste recycling. The human body has a limited ability to respond to Cd exposure since the metal does not undergo metabolic degradation into less toxic species and is only poorly excreted. The extremely long biological half-life of Cd essentially makes it a cumulative toxin; chronic exposure causes harmful effects from the metal stored in the organs.

Exposure to Cd compounds is primarily associated with an elevated risk of lung, kidney, prostate, and pancreatic cancer. Cd has also been linked to cancers of the breast, urinary system, and bladder. The multiple mechanisms of Cd-induced carcinogenesis include oxidative stress with the inhibition of antioxidant enzymes, the promotion of lipid peroxidation, and interference with DNA repair systems.

Description A new class of bacterial genotoxins Individuals with inflammatory bowel disease are at increased risk of developing colorectal cancer compared with the general population. The gut microbiome is among the many factors that can influence tumorigenesis, in part by modulating the immune system and producing microbial metabolites. Cao et al. developed a functional screen to test whether gut bacteria from patients with inflammatory bowel disease have genotoxic effects (see the Perspective by Puschhof and Sears). The authors discovered a family of DNA damage\u2013inducing microbial metabolites called indolimines, which were produced by the Gram-negative bacteria Morganella morganii. In a mouse model of colon cancer, M. morganii exacerbated tumor burden, but a mutant form of the bacteria unable to produce indolimine did not. This diverse series of genotoxic small molecules from the human microbiome may play a role in intestinal tumorigenesis. \u2014PNK Functional screening of commensal gut microbiota reveals small-molecule genotoxins in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. INTRODUCTION Gut microbiota can potentially contribute to the development and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC) by producing small-molecule genotoxins. For example, select commensal Escherichia coli strains produce the canonical microbiota-derived genotoxin colibactin, which engenders the formation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in intestinal epithelial cells and exacerbates CRC in mouse models. Furthermore, human CRCs harbor colibactin-associated mutational signatures, implying a direct role for microbiota-induced DNA damage in CRC. However, the impacts of microbiota-derived genotoxins beyond colibactin remain largely unexplored. RATIONALE Given the extensive diversity of small-molecule metabolites produced by bacteria, we hypothesized that additional taxa from the human gut microbiome might produce previously undiscovered small molecules that cause DNA damage in host cells. Identifying and characterizing such genotoxins and their respective biosynthetic pathways may reveal causal roles of gut microbes in shaping host biology and disease susceptibility. Thus, we designed a large-scale electrophoresis-based DNA damage screening pipeline to evaluate the genotoxicity of a collection of more than 100 gut commensals isolated from patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). RESULTS We identified diverse bacteria from the human microbiota whose small-molecule metabolites caused genotoxicity in both cell-free and cell-based DNA damage assays. For example, small-molecule metabolites from gram-positive bacteria (including Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium ramosum strains) and gram-negative bacteria (including multiple Morganella morganii strains) directly damaged DNA in cell-free assays and induced the expression of the DSB marker \u03b3-H2AX and cell-cycle arrest in epithelial cells. However, the DNA damage patterns caused by these metabolites were distinct from colibactin-induced cross-links, and these isolates lacked the biosynthetic machinery to produce colibactin or other known genotoxins. These data thus implied the existence of previously unrecognized microbiota-derived genotoxins. M. morganii is enriched in the gut microbiota of both IBD and CRC patients. Using a combination of comparative metabolomics and bioactivity-guided natural product-discovery techniques, we discovered a family of M. morganii-derived small-molecule genotoxins\u2014termed the indolimines\u2014that elicited DNA damage in cell-based and cell-free assays. Furthermore, we identified a previously uncharacterized bacterial decarboxylase (annotated as an aspartate aminotransferase encoded by the aat gene) that was essential for indolimine synthesis and constructed an isogenic aat mutant M. morganii that lacked genotoxicity in both cell-free and cell-based DNA damage assays. Compared with the non\u2013indolimine-producing mutant, wild-type M. morganii caused increased intestinal permeability and induced transcriptional signatures associated with abnormal DNA replication and intestinal epithelial cell proliferation in gnotobiotic mice. Furthermore, indolimine-producing M. morganii induced increased colonic tumor burden in the context of a mock microbial community in a mouse model of CRC. CONCLUSION By leveraging function-based assessments of the microbiome, we uncovered the existence of a broader universe of microbiota-derived small-molecule genotoxins. We found that diverse bacterial strains isolated from IBD patients exhibited DNA-damaging activities and discovered a previously undescribed family of genotoxins, termed the indolimines, produced by the IBD- and CRC-associated species M. morganii. Indolimine-producing M. morganii caused increased intestinal permeability and exacerbated colon tumorigenesis in gnotobiotic mice. Overall, these studies imply an expanded role for microbiota-derived genotoxins in shaping host biology and disease susceptibility.

Bacteria in this complex habitat seek to outcompete their neighbors for nutrients and eliminate competitors with antibacterial toxins. Antagonism can be mediated by diverse effectors including toxic proteins and small molecule inhibitors that are released extracellularly or delivered by specialized secretion systems to targeted cells. Two prototypical microbiota-derived enterotoxins, colibactin and tilimycin, and the newly discovered family of indolimines represent an expanding group of non-proteinaceous small molecules which specifically target DNA. In addition to cell killing, they generate mutations and genome instability in intoxicated microbes and host cells alike. They have been studied in detail because of their direct toxicity to human cells and important etiological roles in intestinal pathologies.

These toxins display significant sequence and structure diversity, which results in a wide range of specificities for several different ion channels and receptors. Despite the recognized importance of these compounds, our ability to determine their binding targets and toxicities remains a significant challenge. Predicting the target receptors of conotoxins, based solely on their amino acid sequence, remains a challenge due to the intricate relationships between structure, function, target specificity, and the significant conformational heterogeneity observed in conotoxins with the same primary sequence. We have previously demonstrated that the inclusion of post-translational modifications, collisional cross sections values, and other structural features, when added to the standard primary sequence features, improves the prediction accuracy of conotoxins against non-toxic and other toxic peptides across varied datasets and several different commonly used machine learning classifiers. Here, we present the effects of these features on conotoxin class and molecular target predictions, in particular, predicting conotoxins that bind to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). We also demonstrate the use of the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE)-Tomek in balancing the datasets while simultaneously making the different classes more distinct by reducing the number of ambiguous samples which nearly overlap between the classes. In predicting the alpha, mu, and omega conotoxin classes, the SMOTE-Tomek PCA PLR model, using the combination of the SS and P feature sets establishes the best performance with an overall accuracy (OA) of 95.95%, with an average accuracy (AA) of 93.04%, and an f1 score of 0.959. Using this model, we obtained sensitivities of 98.98%, 89.66%, and 90.48% when predicting alpha, mu, and omega conotoxin classes, respectively. Similarly, in predicting conotoxins that bind to nAChRs, the SMOTE-Tomek PCA SVM model, which used the collisional cross sections (CCSs) and the P feature sets, demonstrated the highest performance with 91.3% OA, 91.32% AA, and an f1 score of 0.9131.

FGF21 has been shown to ameliorate diabetic nephropathy, and in addition FGF-21-treated mice impeded mitogenicity, whereas it is unclear whether FGF21 can influence DN progression by regulating the cell cycle in diabetic nephropathy. Methods In order to create a diabetic model, STZ injections were given to C57BL/6J mice for this investigation. Then, FGF21 was administered, and renal tissue examination and pathological observation were combined with an assessment of glomerular injury, inflammation, oxidative stress, and the fibrinogen system in mice following the administration of the intervention. Furthermore, we used db/db mice and FGF21 direct therapy for 8 weeks to investigate changes in fasting glucose and creatinine expression as well as pathological changes in glomeruli glycogen deposition, fibrosis, and nephrin expression. To investigate the mechanism of action of FGF21 in the treatment of glycolytic kidney, transcriptome sequencing of renal tissues and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of differential genes were performed. Results The study\u2019s findings demonstrated that FGF21 intervention increased clotting time, decreased oxidative stress and inflammation, and avoided thrombosis in addition to considerably improving glomerular filtration damage. After 8 weeks of FGF21 treatment, glomerular glycogen deposition, fibrosis, and renin expression decreased in db/db mice. Moreover, there was a notable reduction of creatinine and fasting blood glucose levels. Additionally, the CDK1 gene, a key player in controlling the cell cycle, was discovered through examination of the transcriptome sequencing data. It was also shown that FGF21 dramatically reduces the expression of CDK1, which may help diabetic nephropathy by averting mitotic catastrophe and changing the renal cell cycle.

Not surprisingly, bones are constantly reabsorbed, formed, and remodeled under physiological conditions. Once bone metabolic homeostasis is interrupted (including inflammation, tumors, fractures, and bone metabolic diseases), the body rapidly initiates bone regeneration to maintain bone tissue structure and quality. Macroautophagy/autophagy is an essential metabolic process in eukaryotic cells, which maintains metabolic energy homeostasis and plays a vital role in bone regeneration by controlling molecular degradation and organelle renewal. One relatively new observation is that mesenchymal cells, osteoblasts, osteoclasts, osteocytes, chondrocytes, and vascularization process exhibit autophagy, and the molecular mechanisms and targets involved are being explored and updated. The role of autophagy is also emerging in degenerative diseases (intervertebral disc degeneration [IVDD], osteoarthritis [OA], etc.) and bone metabolic diseases (osteoporosis [OP], osteitis deformans, osteosclerosis). The use of autophagy regulators to modulate autophagy has benefited bone regeneration, including MTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase) inhibitors, AMPK activators, and emerging phytochemicals. The application of biomaterials (especially nanomaterials) to trigger autophagy is also an attractive research direction, which can exert superior therapeutic properties from the material-loaded molecules/drugs or the material\u2019s properties such as shape, roughness, surface chemistry, etc. All of these have essential clinical significance with the discovery of autophagy associated signals, pathways, mechanisms, and treatments in bone diseases in the future.

Using a massively parallel assay for m6A (MPm6A), we discover that m6A specificity is globally regulated by suppressors that prevent m6A deposition in unmethylated transcriptome regions. We identify exon junction complexes (EJCs) as m6A suppressors that protect exon junction\u2013proximal RNA within coding sequences from methylation and regulate mRNA stability through m6A suppression. EJC suppression of m6A underlies multiple global characteristics of mRNA m6A specificity, with the local range of EJC protection sufficient to suppress m6A deposition in average-length internal exons but not in long internal and terminal exons. EJC-suppressed methylation sites colocalize with EJC-suppressed splice sites, which suggests that exon architecture broadly determines local mRNA accessibility to regulatory complexes. Description Methylation suppression Methylation of the N6 position of adenine (m6A) is a chemical tag for many messenger RNAs (mRNAs) added by m6A \u201cwriter\u201d proteins. Tagged mRNAs are marked for regulation through m6A \u201creader\u201d proteins, which bind methylated mRNAs and alter their expression.

Objectives: Dendrocin-ZM1 (DZM1) and vancomycin are two compounds whose effects on MRSA are examined in this study. Methods: The synergistic bactericidal effect of the peptide-conventional antibiotic combinations was evaluated using the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) assays, and checkerboard method. Additionally, the time-killing kinetics of DZM1 alone and in combination with vancomycin on MRSA ATCC 43300 strain were assessed. Structural alterations and morphological changes of the MRSA ATCC 43300 strain exposed to DZM1 (1/16 MBC) and vancomycin (1/8 MBC), alone or in combination (1/16 MBC DZM1 + 1/8 MBC vancomycin), were analyzed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively. Results: Dendrocin-ZM1 exhibited antimicrobial activity against MRSA clinical isolates and MRSA ATCC 43300 (MIC and MBC: 16 \u00b5g/mL). A synergistic effect was observed when DZM1 was combined with vancomycin (FIC: 0.187) against MRSA ATCC 43300. The combination of DZM1 with vancomycin at sub-MBC concentrations demonstrated sustained bactericidal activity against MRSA ATCC 43300 strain. According to SEM results, DZM1 increased bacterial cell membrane permeability, enhancing the antibacterial activity of vancomycin. Transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed severe membrane damage and subsequent cell lysis in the MRSA ATCC 43300 strain when treated with the combination of DZM1 and vancomycin.

From this library, we selected a set of 14 peptide conjugates including both highly and poorly active sequences and we performed a structure-activity relationship study by NMR and MD simulations. Analysis of their structure by NMR in 30% TFE-d3 and in zwitterionic DPC-d38 and anionic SDS-d25 micelles showed that the presence of an \u03b1-helix fragment together with a flexible random coil can be related to a high antibacterial activity and a low hemolysis. In contrast, the sequences with a rigid \u03b1-helix structure were low active and highly hemolytic. PRE-NMR experiments in presence of MnCl2 and 16-DSA revealed that the highly active peptides flg15-BP475 and BP100-Pep13 interacted stronger with DPC-d38 micelles than the low active peptide BP13-BP16. In the two former sequences this interaction took place through the \u03b1-helix region. From GaMD simulations of BP100-Pep13 conducted in membranes composed of anionic DPPG lipids, after its electrostatic interaction, the peptide flipped and the hydrophobic residues were faced to the membrane triggering its insertion and also causing membrane thinning.

Concurrently, we examined the changes in inflammation and liver damage in the ileum of ALD and healthy mice following foodborne infection with V. vulnificus. Results Compared with the control group, the expression levels of ZO\u20101, Claudin\u20101 and E\u2010cadherin were reduced in the ileum of ALD mice, while those of NLRP3, caspase\u20101(p20), GSDMD\u2010N and IL\u20101\u03b2 were elevated. Nlrp3 \u2212/\u2212 and Gsdmd \u2212/\u2212 ALD mice showed an increased gut bacterial load, decreased ileal expression of E\u2010cadherin, more severe ileitis, pronounced liver damage, steatosis and higher plasma levels of FITC\u2010dextran, D\u2010LA and ZO\u20101 compared with WT mice. Notably, Nlrp3 \u2212/\u2212 ALD mice exhibited a higher presence of Deferribacterota and Enterobacteriaceae. Furthermore, ALD mice infected with V. vulnificus infection exhibited no further activation of NLRP3 in the ileum, leading to increased intestinal permeability and bloodstream infections. Conclusions This study indicated that NLRP3 activation in the ileum of ALD mice stabilizes the inflammation\u2010related gut microbiota, preserves the intestinal epithelial barrier, and diminishes inflammation and liver injury. Furthermore, the compromised immune defence in ALD mice may contribute to their heightened susceptibility to bacterial pathogens. Key points Activation of the NLRP3\u2010GSDMD pathway in the ileum of Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) mice.

A thorough understanding of the underlying mechanism is integral to solving these problems, and cell death has gained much attention. In addition to apoptosis, autophagy, and necrosis, several novel cell death pathways, such as necroptosis, mitotic catastrophe, paraptosis and pyroptosis, have been reported in PDT treatment. The type of induced cell death depends on the dose of PDT, the subcellular location of PSs, and the regulation of signaling pathways. In addition, different types of cell death induced by the same type of PDT, such as apoptosis and autophagy, may interact with each other. Some types of cell death can also trigger immunogenic cell death (ICD), which can ignite an immune response against antigens derived from dying/dead cells and present improved antitumor effects. On the basis of these mechanisms, several strategies, such as targeted PSs, PDT combined with immunotherapy and ICD\u2010based vaccines, have been proposed to improve therapeutic efficacy.

Receptor activation can lead to activation of the G\u03b1s protein and a subsequent increase of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Receptor interaction with inverse agonists results in a decrease of basal cAMP levels and therefore a downstream effect of reduced neuronal excitability and neurotransmission. Recently, pellotine (1a), a Lophophora alkaloid, was unexpectedly shown to be an inverse agonist of the 5-HT7R. Therefore, we evaluated close analogs of compound 1a, both naturally occurring and synthetic analogs, as inverse agonists of the 5-HT7R. Functional evaluation in a GloSensor cAMP assay revealed a preference for an 8-hydroxy-6,7-dimethoxy substitution pattern over 6,7,8-trimethoxy analogs or 8-hydroxy-6,7-methylenedioxy analogs. This was supported by molecular dynamics simulations, where the 8-hydroxy substitution allowed more robust interaction with the 5-HT7R, which correlated with inverse agonism efficacy. Additionally, N-methylation (as in 1a) improved the potency of the evaluated analogs. In this series, the most potent inverse agonist was anhalidine (1b) (EC50 = 219 nM, Emax = -95.4%), which lacks the 1-methyl, compared to pellotine (1a), and showed a 2-fold higher functional potency.

However, the dynamic and energetic details quantifying the balance and contribution of these factors, particularly the balancing nature of specific interactions formed by antibodies with the epitope residues remain scarcely characterized. In this study, we performed molecular dynamics simulations, ensemble-based deep mutational scanning of SARS-CoV-2 spike residues and binding free energy computations for two distinct groups of broadly neutralizing antibodies : E1 group (BD55-3152, BD55-3546 and BD5-5840) and F3 group (BD55-3372, BD55-4637 and BD55-5514). Using these approaches, we examine the energetic determinants by which broadly potent antibodies can largely evade immune resistance. Our analysis revealed the emergence of a small number of immune escape positions for E1 group antibodies that correspond to R346 and K444 positions in which the strong van der Waals and interactions act synchronously leading to the large binding contribution. According to our results, E1 and F3 groups of Abs effectively exploit binding hotspot clusters of hydrophobic sites critical for spike functions along with selective complementary targeting of positively charged sites that are important for ACE2 binding. Together with targeting conserved epitopes, these groups of antibodies can lead to the expanded neutralization breadth and resilience to antigenic shift associated with viral evolution. The results of this study and the energetic analysis demonstrate excellent qualitative agreement between the predicted binding hotspots and critical mutations with respect to the latest experiments on average antibody escape scores.

Concordantly, YTHDF1 protein negatively correlated with CD8+ T-cell infiltration in independent tissue microarrays cohorts, implying its role in TIME. Genetic depletion of Ythdf1 augmented antitumour immunity in CT26 (MSS-CRC) and MC38 (MSI-H-CRC) syngeneic tumours, while Ythdf1 knockin promoted an immunosuppressive TIME facilitating CRC in azoxymethane-dextran sulphate-sodium or ApcMin/+ models. scRNA-seq identified reduction of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), concomitant with increased cytotoxic T cells in Ythdf1 knockout tumours. Integrated MeRIP-seq, RNA-seq and Ribo-seq revealed p65/Rela as a YTHDF1 target. YTHDF1 promoted p65 translation to upregulate CXCL1, which increased MDSC migration via CXCL1-CXCR2 axis. Increased MSDCs in turn antagonised functional CD8+ T cells in TIME. Importantly, targeting YTHDF1 by CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) or VNPs-siYTHDF1 boosted anti-PD1 efficacy in MSI-H CRC, and overcame anti-PD1 resistance in MSS CRC.

One resistance mechanism involves defects in interferon\u2010\u03b3 (IFN\u2010\u03b3) signaling, in which IFN\u2010\u03b3 is linked to improved responsiveness to ICIs. Herein, the roles of RNA N6 \u2010methyladenosine (m6A) modifications in regulation of IFN\u2010\u03b3 signaling and the responsiveness to ICIs are unveiled. The m6A\u2010binding protein YTH N 6\u2010methyladenosine RNA\u2010binding protein F1 (YTHDF1) is overexpressed in GC tissues, correlating with the suppression of cancer immunity and poorer survival rates. YTHDF1 overexpression impaired the responsiveness to IFN\u2010\u03b3 in GC cells, and knockdown studies indicated the redundant effects of YTHDF2 and YTHDF3 with YTHDF1 in IFN\u2010\u03b3 responsiveness. RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing revealed YTHDFs directly target interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) mRNA, a master regulator of IFN\u2010\u03b3 signaling, leading to reduced RNA stability and consequent downregulation of IFN\u2010\u03b3 signaling. Furthermore, in mouse syngeneic tumor models, Ythdf1 depletion in cancer cells resulted in reduced tumor growth and increased tumor\u2010infiltrating lymphocytes, which are attributed to the augmentation of IFN\u2010\u03b3 signaling.

M1 and M2 macrophages are two polarized forms of mononuclear phagocyte in vitro differentiation with distinct phenotypic patterns and functional properties, but in vivo, there is a wide range of different macrophage phenotypes in between depending on the microenvironment and natural signals they receive. In human infections, pathogens use different strategies to combat macrophages and these strategies include shaping the macrophage polarization towards one or another phenotype. Macrophages infiltrating the tumours can affect the patient\u2019s prognosis. M2 macrophages have been shown to promote tumour growth, while M1 macrophages provide both tumour-promoting and anti-tumour properties. In autoimmune diseases, both prolonged M1 activation, as well as altered M2 function can contribute to their onset and activity. In human atherosclerotic lesions, macrophages expressing both M1 and M2 profiles have been detected as one of the potential factors affecting occurrence of cardiovascular diseases. In allergic inflammation, T2 cytokines drive macrophage polarization towards M2 profiles, which promote airway inflammation and remodelling. M1 macrophages in transplantations seem to contribute to acute rejection, while M2 macrophages promote the fibrosis of the graft. The view of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages and M2 macrophages suppressing inflammation seems to be an oversimplification because these cells exploit very high level of plasticity and represent a large scale of different immunophenotypes with overlapping properties.

We find that HEM loss is more effective than cross-entropy loss across a wide range of tasks: unknown class rejection, adversarial robustness, learning with imbalanced data, continual learning, and semantic segmentation (a pixel-level classification task).

A fine-tuned systemic induction system is involved in ROS-mediated disease development in plants. In regulated concentrations, ROS act as a signaling molecule and activate different pathways to suppress the pathogens. However, an excess of these ROS is deleterious to the plant system. Along with altering cell structure, ROS cause a variety of physiological reactions in plants that lower plant yield. ROS also degrade proteins, enzymes, nucleic acids, and other substances. Plants have their own mechanisms to overcome excess ROS and maintain homeostasis. Microbes, especially endophytes, have been reported to maintain ROS homeostasis in both biotic and abiotic stresses by multiple mechanisms.

This study investigated the impact of pre-sowing treatment with exogenous auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) at various concentrations (0, 10, 1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001, 0.00001 mg L\u22121) on the growth and antioxidant responses of three cultivars (cvs) of Phaseolus vulgaris L.

Ufimskaya cv exhibited significant increases in shoot, main root, and total root lengths at 0.001 mg L\u22121 IAA, while higher and lower concentrations inhibited growth. The reduced catalase (CAT) activity in roots and the elevated CAT activity in shoots correlated with shoot length and total root length of Ufimskaya cv.

The growth of only the main root of Elsa cv peaked at 0.1 mg L\u22121 IAA, and there were neutral or inhibitory effects with other concentrations. The positive correlation between CAT activity in shoots and the main root length and total root length as well as positive correlation between MDA content in roots and the total root length of Elsa cultivar were revealed. The shoot length and total root length of Zolotistaya cv were neutral or negatively responded to all concentration IAA, but the number of roots increased by 2\u20134 times. For Zolotistaya cv, positive correlations were observed between CAT activity in roots and the length of the main root and the total root length.

Cytotoxic innate and adaptive immune cells can block tumor proliferation, and others can prevent the immune system from rejecting malignant cells and provide a favorable environment for tumor progression. These cells communicate with the microenvironment through cytokines, a chemical messenger, in an endocrine, paracrine, or autocrine manner. These cytokines play an important role in health and disease, particularly in host immune responses to infection and inflammation. They include chemokines, interleukins (ILs), adipokines, interferons, colony-stimulating factors (CSFs), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which are produced by a wide range of cells, including immune cells, such as macrophages, B-cells, T-cells, and mast cells, as well as endothelial cells, fibroblasts, a variety of stromal cells, and some cancer cells. Cytokines play a crucial role in cancer and cancer-related inflammation, with direct and indirect effects on tumor antagonistic or tumor promoting functions. They have been extensively researched as immunostimulatory mediators to promote the generation, migration and recruitment of immune cells that contribute to an effective antitumor immune response or pro-tumor microenvironment. Thus, in many cancers such as breast cancer, cytokines including leptin, IL-1B, IL-6, IL-8, IL-23, IL-17, and IL-10 stimulate while others including IL-2, IL-12, and IFN-\u03b3, inhibit cancer proliferation and/or invasion and enhance the body\u2019s anti-tumor defense.

Accordingly, targeting and blocking tumor-promoting cytokines or activating and amplifying tumor-inhibiting cytokines are considered cancer-directed therapies.

Modern subunit vaccines offer more precise target and safe protection compared to traditional whole-pathogen vaccines. However, subunit vaccines require adjuvants to stimulate the immune system due to the less immunogenicity. Adjuvants strengthen immunogenicity by enhancing, modulating, and prolonging the immune response. Unfortunately, few adjuvants have sufficient potency and low enough toxicity for clinical use, highlighting the urgent need for new vaccine adjuvants with the characteristics of safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness. Notably, some natural polysaccharides have been approved as adjuvants in human vaccines, owing to their intrinsic immunomodulation, low toxicity, and high safety. Natural polysaccharides are mainly derived from plants, bacteria, and yeast. Partly owing to the difficulty of obtaining them, synthetic polysaccharides emerged in clinical trials. The immune mechanisms of both natural and synthetic polysaccharides remain incompletely understood, hindering the rational development of polysaccharide adjuvants.

Five molecular-genetic subtypes of breast cancer are recognized. The most aggressive course is known to be characterized by non-luminal subtypes, in particular, a triplenegative breast cancer. The aim of this research is to determine the association between the percentage of the cells showing distinct differentiation types, and cytokine production by breast cancer bioptates in both luminal and non-luminal breast cancer subtypes. Bioptates of 49 women with the invasive breast carcinoma of nonspecific type, at the average age of 59 years, were used as the material for the study. The patients were divided into three groups according to the molecular-genetic subtype of cancer. Group I included patients with luminal subtype A, group II \u2013 with luminal B and group III \u2013 with non-luminal subtypes of breast cancer. Spontaneous and in vitro stimulated by polyclonal activators production of cytokines was evaluated. The level of cytokineproducing reserve by the biopsy specimens was expressed as the influence index of polyclonal activators, due to its accuracy, thus making it possible to avoid errors due to the similar sizes of bioptates from each patient and their incubation conditions. The percentage of tumor cells of varying degrees of differentiation in the samples was assessed using light microscopy by means of the Nottingham grading system. When assessing spontaneous and stimulated production of cytokines, as well as degree of cell differentiation of tumor samples, direct and reverse correlations were revealed between the study groups. The most important parameter was the influence index of the polyclonal activator which characterized production of IL-10 and VEGF-A by the bioptates. Therefore, we can provide personalized information for each patient, in particular, for these two cytokines, even before starting the treatment.The analysis of ROC-curves showed good quality and optimal level of cytokine concentration and percentage of low-differentiated cells. This approach could predict the presence of unfavorable non-luminal breast cancer subtypes in the best way.

Its treatment is challenging due to the peculiar glioblastoma cell biology and its microenvironment complexity. Specifically, a small fraction of glioma stem cells within the tumor mass drives tumor growth and invasiveness by hijacking brain resident and immune cells.

The TME, which is highly immunosuppressive and shaped by hypoxia, impairs anti-tumor immunity and limits the efficacy of immunotherapy.

It is often detected at late stages, resulting in unfavorable outcomes, with tumor cell heterogeneity and medication resistance. Tumor\u2010associated macrophages are among the key cells contributing to cancer progression. They are categorized into two primary phenotypes: Proinflammatory (M1) and anti\u2010inflammatory (M2) which are involved in the onset and progression of NSCLC. The role of common cytokines secreted by macrophages in the progression of lung cancer are described, and the effects of various substances such as RNA or protein on the differentiation and polarization of two phenotypes of macrophages are highlighted to characterize the impact of the immune state of tumors on therapeutic effect of treatments and patient prognosis. Researchers have primarily aimed to investigate innovative carriers and strategies based on macrophages to modify the tumor microenvironment. Objectives These approaches are often integrated with other treatments, particularly immunotherapy, to enhance therapeutic efficacy. Methods A comprehensive review was carried out by systematically synthesizing existing literature on PubMed, using the combination of the keywords \u201cTAMs\u201d, \u201cNSCLC\u201d, \u201cDrug resistance\u201d, and \u201ctherapy\u201d. The available studies were screened for selection based on quality and relevance. Conclusions TAMs promote tumor invasion, growth, and metastasis by promoting angiogenesis and EMT. In addition, they contribute to the development of drug resistance and the immunosuppressive microenvironment establishment. The immunosuppressive factors secreted by TAM can weaken the activity of immune cells, inhibit their killing effect on tumors, leading to immune suppression and hindering the effectiveness of treatment. Therefore, TAM is a key target for the development of cancer immunotherapy. Various strategies are being explored, including reducing the recruitment of TAMs and influencing their polarization to treat NSCLC.

Identifying key macrophage populations found in human fibrotic tissues could lead to new treatments for fibrosis. Here, we used human liver and lung single-cell RNA sequencing datasets to identify a subset of CD9+TREM2+ macrophages that express SPP1, GPNMB, FABP5, and CD63. In both human and murine hepatic and pulmonary fibrosis, these macrophages were enriched at the outside edges of scarring and adjacent to activated mesenchymal cells. Neutrophils expressing MMP9, which participates in the activation of TGF-\u03b21, and the type 3 cytokines GM-CSF and IL-17A coclustered with these macrophages. In vitro, GM-CSF, IL-17A, and TGF-\u03b21 drive the differentiation of human monocytes into macrophages expressing scar-associated markers. Such differentiated cells could degrade collagen IV but not collagen I and promote TGF-\u03b21\u2013induced collagen I deposition by activated mesenchymal cells. In murine models blocking GM-CSF, IL-17A or TGF-\u03b21 reduced scar-associated macrophage expansion and hepatic or pulmonary fibrosis. Our work identifies a highly specific macrophage population to which we assign a profibrotic role across species and tissues. It further provides a strategy for unbiased discovery, triage, and preclinical validation of therapeutic targets based on this fibrogenic macrophage population. Description A five-marker signature identifies scar-associated macrophages that differentiate in response to GM-CSF, IL-17A, and TGF-\u03b2 across species and tissues. Fibrogenic fiend Macrophages are key players in responding to tissue injury, and specific macrophage subsets can drive fibrosis progression or resolution. Fabre et al. showed that CD9+TREM2+ macrophages further defined by expression of SPP1, GPNMB, FABP5, and CD63 can mediate fibrosis. Analysis of human and murine hepatic and pulmonary fibrosis samples revealed accumulation of these macrophages near scar sites and proximal to activated mesenchymal cells. These macrophages also clustered with MMP9-expressing neutrophils that secreted GM-CSF and IL-17A and drove TGF-\u03b21 activation. In vitro analysis revealed that GM-CSF, IL-17A, and TGF-\u03b21 can promote differentiation of these macrophages, which are unable to degrade collagen I and contribute to collagen I\u2013associated fibrosis.

However, the mechanisms underlying the developmental process of monoecious figs in response to the entry of pollinating fig wasps (pollinators) and the metabolic changes occurring during this process remain elusive. Our study employed a combination of controlled experiments in the field and LC-MS methods to investigate the impact of pollinating fig wasp entry on the developmental phase of figs, as well as the metabolic alterations occurring during this process. A total of 381 metabolites and 155 differential metabolites were identified, with the predominant classes of metabolites being organic acids, lipids, and benzene aromatic compounds. The results suggest that in the absence of wasp entry, the receptive phase of fig would exhibit an extended duration. However, upon the entry of fig wasps, the receptive phase of figs would terminate within a span of 1 to 2 days, concomitant with substantial fluctuations in the composition and proportions of metabolites within the fig. Our research focuses on the analysis of linoleic acid metabolism, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and flavonoid biosynthesis pathways. Our findings suggest that the entry of wasps triggers alterations in the metabolic regulatory mechanisms of figs. Prior to wasp entry, metabolites primarily regulate fig growth and development. However, after wasp entry, metabolites predominantly govern lipid accumulation and the establishment of defense mechanisms, indicating a transition in fig development.

The proliferation of laryngeal cancer cells relies on the expression of CTSL, with overexpression of this gene enhancing the proliferative capacity of these cells. Concurrently, CTSL is closely associated with the autophagic levels in laryngeal cancer cells.

Plants have evolved several adaptive strategies to cope with drought. Stomata are essential structures for plants to control water status and photosynthesis rate. Stomatal closure is an efficient way for plants to reduce water loss and improve survivability under drought conditions. The opening and closure of stomata depend on the turgor pressure in guard cells. Three key signaling molecules, including abscisic acid (ABA), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and calcium ion (Ca2+), play pivotal roles in controlling stomatal closure. Plants sense the water-deficit signal mainly via leaves and roots. On the one hand, ABA is actively synthesized in root and leaf vascular tissues and transported to guard cells. On the other hand, the roots sense the water-deficit signal and synthesize CLAVATA3/EMBRYO-SURROUNDING REGION RELATED 25 (CLE25) peptide, which is transported to the guard cells to promote ABA synthesis. ABA is perceived by pyrabactin resistance (PYR)/PYR1-like (PYL)/regulatory components of ABA receptor (RCAR) receptors, which inactivate PP2C, resulting in activating the protein kinases SnRK2s. Many proteins regulating stomatal closure are activated by SnRK2s via protein phosphorylation. ABA-activated SnRK2s promote apoplastic ROS production outside of guard cells and transportation into the guard cells. The apoplastic H2O2 can be directly sensed by a receptor kinase, HYDROGEN PEROXIDE-INDUCED CA2+ INCREASES1 (HPCA1), which induces activation of Ca2+ channels in the cytomembrane of guard cells, and triggers an increase in Ca2+ in the cytoplasm of guard cells, resulting in stomatal closure. In this review, we focused on discussing the signaling transduction of ABA, ROS, and Ca2+ in controlling stomatal closure in response to drought. Many critical genes are identified to have a function in stomatal closure under drought conditions. The identified genes in the process can serve as candidate genes for genetic engineering to improve drought resistance in crops.

This creates a situation where we have deep cellular profiles of one sample or condition, and bulk profiles across multiple samples and conditions. To bridge this gap, we propose BuDDI (BUlk Deconvolution with Domain Invariance). BuDDI utilizes domain adaptation techniques to effectively integrate available corpora of case-control bulk and reference scRNA-seq observations to infer cell-type-specific perturbation effects. BuDDI achieves this by learning independent latent spaces within a single variational autoencoder (VAE) encompassing at least four sources of variability: 1) cell type proportion, 2) perturbation effect, 3) structured experimental variability, and 4) remaining variability. Since each latent space is encouraged to be independent, we simulate perturbation responses by independently composing each latent space to simulate cell-type-specific perturbation responses. We evaluated BuDDI\u2019s performance on simulated and real data with experimental designs of increasing complexity. We first validated that BuDDI could learn domain invariant latent spaces on data with matched samples across each source of variability. Then we validated that BuDDI could accurately predict cell-type-specific perturbation response when no single-cell perturbed profiles were used during training; instead, only bulk samples had both perturbed and non-perturbed observations. Finally, we validated BuDDI on predicting sex-specific differences, an experimental design where it is not possible to have matched samples.

Soft rot, caused by the pathogen Rhizopus stolonifer, is a major postharvest disease affecting sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam). The main theme of this study is to determine the CAC inhibitory mechanism against Rhizopus stolonifer, the causative agent of sweet potato soft rot. To ascertain the practical applicability of CAC, both in vitro and in vivo methodologies were employed. The aim of the in vitro experiments in this study was to delineate the effects of a 0.5% (w/v) CAC solution on the growth inhibition of Rhizopus stolonifer, encompassing mycelial morphology and colony expansion. In vivo experiments were carried out using \u201cXinxiang\u201d sweet potato varieties and the application of a 0.5% (w/v) CAC solution as a pretreatment. Specifically, the tissue treated with 0.5% CAC maintained better appearance quality and texture characteristics; peroxidase, \u03b2-1,3-glucanase, chitinase, and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase activities were enhanced. Conversely, the same treatment resulted in a downregulation of polyphenol oxidase, catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, cellulase, and polygalactosidase activities. Moreover, CAC treatment was found to maintain elevated levels of total phenolics and flavonoids within the sweet potato tissues. In summary, the study demonstrates that 0.5% CAC fortifies the resistance of sweet potato to soft rot by activating defense-related enzymes, suppressing the activity of cell wall-degrading enzymes, and promoting the accumulation of antimicrobial compounds.

Results: Both preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that adipokines play a role in modulating cardiovascular function, thereby contributing to the development of cardiometabolic HFpEF. Leptin promotes myocardial hypertrophy, fibrosis, endothelial dysfunction, and inflammation, though contradictory evidence suggests potential cardioprotective roles in subgroups like obese African American women. Adiponectin generally offers protective effects but presents a paradox, where elevated levels may correlate with worse outcomes, which may reflect either a compensatory response to cardiac dysfunction or a maladaptive state characterized by adiponectin resistance. Resistin is associated with increased cardiovascular risk through pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic effects, though its role in HFpEF requires further clarification.

New research clarifies the pathobiologic mechanisms responsible for plaque development/progression/destabilization leading to MACE (plaque hypothesis), but the translation of these insights to clinical management strategies has lagged. This narrative review elaborates the plaque hypothesis and explicates the current understanding of underlying pathobiologic mechanisms, the provocative destabilizing influences, the diagnostic and therapeutic implications, and their actionable clinical management approaches to optimize the management of patients with chronic coronary disease.\n\n\nObservations\nClinical trials of management strategies for patients with chronic coronary artery disease demonstrate that while MACE rate increases progressively with the anatomic extent of coronary disease, revascularization of the ischemia-producing obstruction does not forestall MACE. Most severely obstructive coronary lesions often remain quiescent and seldom destabilize to cause a MACE. Coronary lesions that later provoke acute myocardial infarction often do not narrow the lumen critically. Invasive and noninvasive imaging can identify the plaque anatomic characteristics (plaque burden, plaque topography, lipid content) and local hemodynamic/biomechanical characteristics (endothelial shear stress, plaque structural stress, axial plaque stress) that can indicate the propensity of individual plaques to provoke a MACE.\n\n\nConclusions and Relevance\nThe pathobiologic construct concerning the culprit region of a plaque most likely to cause a MACE (plaque hypothesis), which incorporates multiple convergent plaque features, informs the evolution of a new management strategy capable of identifying the high-risk portion of plaque wherever it is located along the course of the coronary artery. Ongoing investigations of high-risk plaque features, coupled with technical advances to enable prognostic characterization in real time and at the point of care, will soon enable evaluation of the entire length of the atheromatous coronary artery and broaden the target(s) of our therapeutic intervention to include all regions of the plaque (both flow limiting and nonflow limiting).", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-12-14", "synthetic_support_claim": "The plaque burden along the entire coronary tree, not solely severe obstructions, is linked to MACE.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Most severely obstructive coronary lesions should always be prioritized for revascularization to prevent MACE effectively."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "3751ba3c30e2d68b776d5140704d33eac2f14a4f", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3751ba3c30e2d68b776d5140704d33eac2f14a4f", "title": "The Chinese Herbal Medicine Li Qi Huo Xue Di Wan Ameliorates Ischemia or Hypoxia-Induced Cardiac Injury and Remodeling in the Heart Through a Mechanism Involving Reduction of Necroptosis.", "abstract": "Li Qi Huo Xue Di Wan (LQHXDW), a Chinese herbal medicine, is commonly used to treat symptoms such as palpitations, chest tightness, chest pain, and shortness of breath.

The mouse heart was subjected to ischemia for 14\u2009days, showing evident myocardial injury and notable cardiac remodeling, accompanied by a reduction in cardiac function; these phenomena were reversed in the presence of LQHXDW. In the cultured cardiomyocyte exposed to hypoxia, incubation with LQHXDW increased the cell viability and reduced lactate dehydrogenase release.

This study suggests that Lp082 has a therapeutic effect on colitis in mice. ABSTRACT Probiotics can effectively improve ulcerative colitis (UC), but the mechanism is still unclear. Here, shotgun metagenome and transcriptome analyses were performed to explore the therapeutic effect and the mechanism of the probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum HNU082 (Lp082) on UC. The results showed that Lp082 treatment significantly ameliorated dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced UC in mice, which was manifested as increases in body weight, water intake, food intake, and colon length and decreases in disease activity index (DAI), immune organ index, inflammatory factors, and histopathological scores after Lp082 intake. An in-depth study discovered that Lp082 could improve the intestinal mucosal barrier and relieve inflammation by cooptimizing the biological barrier, chemical barrier, mechanical barrier, and immune barrier. Specifically, Lp082 rebuilt the biological barrier by regulating the intestinal microbiome and increasing the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Lp082 improved the chemical barrier by reducing intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM) and increasing goblet cells and mucin2. Lp082 ameliorated the mechanical barrier by increasing zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), zonula occludens-2 (ZO-2), and occludin while decreasing claudin-1 and claudin-2. Lp082 optimized the immune barrier by reducing the content of interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) and increasing IL-10, transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21), and TGF-\u03b22, inhibiting the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Taken together, probiotic Lp082 can play a protective role in a DSS-induced colitis mouse model by protecting the intestinal mucosal barrier, attenuating the inflammatory response, and regulating microbial imbalance. This study provides support for the development of probiotic-based microbial products as an alternative treatment strategy for UC. IMPORTANCE Many studies have focused on the therapeutic effect of probiotics on ulcerative colitis (UC), but few studies have paid attention to the mechanism of probiotics, especially the therapeutic effect. This study suggests that Lp082 has a therapeutic effect on colitis in mice. Its mechanisms of action include protecting the mucosal barrier and actively modulating the gut microbiome, modulating inflammatory pathways, and reducing neutrophil infiltration.

These investigations have demonstrated that epidemics thrive under environmental stressors such as climate change, the depletion of natural resources, and detrimental human activities such as wars, conflicts, antibiotic overuse, and pollution. Moreover, bacteria possess a remarkable ability to adapt and mutate. Unfortunately, the current development of antibiotics is insufficient, and the future appears grim unless we abandon our current approach of generating synthetic antibiotics that rapidly lose their effectiveness against multidrug-resistant bacteria.

Existing antibiotic treatments are often rendered ineffective due to the development of bacterial resistance, while Scutellaria barbata (SLB) has attracted widespread attention for its remarkable anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties. However, its role in acne treatment has not been comprehensively studied. This study used high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to analyze the bioactive components in a 70% ethanol extract of SLB. The antibacterial activity against C. acnes was systematically evaluated using well diffusion, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), and biofilm formation assays. Additionally, the effects of SLB on nitric oxide (NO) production and phagocytic activity were tested in RAW 264.7 cells. An acne skin model was established by treating HaCaT keratinocytes with heat-inactivated C. acnes. The results demonstrated that SLB significantly inhibited the growth of C. acnes and disrupted its biofilm formation.

According to WHO, about 5% of the worldwide population suffers from depression. Newer studies report a staggering global prevalence of 27.6%, and it is rising. Professionally, depression belonging to affective disorders is a psychiatric illness, and the category of major depressive disorder (MDD) comprises various diagnoses related to persistent and disruptive mood disorders. Due to this fact, it is imperative to find a way to assess depression quantitatively using a specific biomarker or a panel of biomarkers that would be able to reflect the patients\u2019 state and the effects of therapy. Cytokines, hormones, oxidative stress markers, and neuropeptides are studied in association with depression. The latest research into inflammatory cytokines shows that their relationship with the etiology of depression is causative. There are stronger cytokine reactions to pathogens and stressors in depression. If combined with other predisposing factors, responses lead to prolonged inflammatory processes, prolonged dysregulation of various axes, stress, pain, mood changes, anxiety, and depression. This review focuses on the most recent data on cytokines as markers of depression concerning their roles in its pathogenesis, their possible use in diagnosis and management, their different levels in bodily fluids, and their similarities in animal studies.

Among the list, IL-6 and IL-17 are host-derived paradoxical effectors that attune immune responses in malignant lung cells. Their excessive release in the cytokine milieu stabilizes immunosuppressive phenotypes, resulting in cellular perturbations. During tumor development, the significance of these molecules is reflected in their potential to regulate oncogenesis by initiating a myriad of signaling events that influence tumor growth and the metastatic ability of benign cancer cells.

However, diagnosis is more precise, and the increased number of new cases is related to the improved diagnosis tools. Despite better early diagnosis and better therapies, melanoma has remained a significant public health challenge because of its aggressive behavior and high potential for metastasis. In 2020, cutaneous melanoma constituted approximately 1.3% of all cancer deaths that occurred within the European Union, thereby highlighting the necessity for effective prevention, timely diagnosis, and sustainable treatment measures, especially as a growing number of cases occur among younger patients. Melanoma is regarded as one of the most inflamed cancers due to its high immune cell presence and strong response to immunotherapy, fueling the need for development of immune-driven innovative treatments. Approved therapies, including immune checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4), have notably improved survival rates in melanoma. However, the limitations of the PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 axes inhibitors, such as low response rates, treatment resistance, and toxicity, have driven the need for continued research and advancements in treatment strategies. Current clinical trials are exploring various combinations of immune checkpoint inhibitors with costimulatory receptor agonists, chemotherapy, targeted therapies, and other immunotherapies, with the goal of improving outcomes and reducing side effects for melanoma patients. Emerging approaches, including adoptive cell therapy with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and oncolytic virotherapy, are showing promise.

Consistent with immunological imprinting, most antibodies derived from memory B cells or plasma cells of Omicron breakthrough cases cross-react with the Wuhan-Hu-1, BA.1, BA.2, and BA.4/5 receptor-binding domains, whereas Omicron primary infections elicit B cells of narrow specificity up to 6 months after infection. Although most clinical antibodies have reduced neutralization of Omicron, we identified an ultrapotent pan-variant\u2013neutralizing antibody that is a strong candidate for clinical development. Description Defending against Omicron The Omicron BA.1 lineage of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in late 2021 and quickly became dominant, in part because of a large number of mutations that allowed escape from existing antibodies. New infection waves have come from other Omicron sublineages. Park et al. found that either a vaccination booster or a breakthrough infection elicits neutralization activity against the Omicron variants, but only a breakthrough infection induces an antibody response in the nasal mucosa, which might give better protection against transmission. Testing a panel of antibodies, the authors showed that the antibody S2X324 potently neutralizes all SARS-CoV-2 variants tested, making it a candidate for therapeutic development.

The extent to which the currently used messenger RNA (mRNA)\u2013based COVID-19 vaccines induce mucosal immunity remains poorly characterized. We evaluated mucosal neutralizing antibody responses in a cohort of 183 individuals. Participants were sampled at several time points after primary adenovirus vector\u2013based or mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccination and after mRNA-based booster vaccinations. Our findings revealed that repeated vaccination with mRNA boosters promoted severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) neutralizing antibodies in nasal secretions. Nasal and serum neutralizing antibody titers of both IgG and IgA isotypes correlated to one another. We investigated the source of these mucosal antibodies in a mouse model wherein mice received repeated mRNA vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. These experiments indicated that neutralizing antibody\u2013producing cells reside in the spleen and bone marrow, whereas no proof of tissue homing to the respiratory mucosa was observed, despite the detection of mucosal antibodies. Serum transfer experiments confirmed that circulating antibodies were able to migrate to the respiratory mucosa. Collectively, these results demonstrate that, especially upon repeated vaccination, the currently used COVID-19 mRNA vaccines can elicit mucosal neutralizing antibodies and that vaccination might also stimulate mucosal immunity induced by previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, migration of circulating antibodies to the respiratory mucosa might be a main mechanism. These findings advance our understanding of mRNA vaccine\u2013induced immunity and have implications for the design of vaccine strategies to combat respiratory infections. mRNA booster vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 induce circulating virus neutralizing antibodies that may enter the respiratory mucosa. Editor\u2019s summary mRNA vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 elicit robust antibody responses in the circulation, which aid in protection from severe disease. However, the extent to which mRNA vaccines, which are delivered intramuscularly, can elicit mucosal immune responses is unclear. In a pair of papers, Declercq et al. and Lasrado et al. come to distinct conclusions. Using human nasal swab samples in both studies, Declercq et al. show that repeated vaccination for SARS-CoV-2 promotes neutralizing antibodies in the nose, whereas Lasrado et al. observed no obvious increase in neutralizing antibody titers after booster vaccination. These differing results may be due to the number of SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations or exposures, time since last exposure, and experimental approaches, but this pair of papers underscores the need to better understand the mucosal immune response in humans. \u2014Courtney Malo", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-10-23", "synthetic_support_claim": "Repeated vaccination with mRNA boosters promoted SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in nasal secretions.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines do not induce mucosal immunity in the respiratory tract."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "e7b8e2948b04fc57f9424a26919bf1e9d5b96411", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e7b8e2948b04fc57f9424a26919bf1e9d5b96411", "title": "Characterization of Vaccine-Enhanced Humoral Immune Responses Against Emergent SARS-CoV-2 Variants in a Convalescent Cohort", "abstract": "Vaccination of COVID-19\u2013convalescent individuals may generate \u2018hybrid\u2019 immunity of enhanced magnitude, durability, and cross-reactive breadth.

However, several Trp metabolism end-products are essential to intestinal homeostasis. Here, we investigated the role of metabolites from the kynurenine pathway. Design Targeted quantitative metabolomics was performed in two large human IBD cohorts (1069 patients with IBD). Dextran sodium sulphate-induced colitis experiments in mice were used to evaluate effects of identified metabolites. In vitro, ex vivo and in vivo experiments were used to decipher mechanisms involved. Effects on energy metabolism were evaluated by different methods including Single Cell mEtabolism by profiling Translation inHibition. Results In mice and humans, intestinal inflammation severity negatively correlates with the amount of xanthurenic (XANA) and kynurenic (KYNA) acids. Supplementation with XANA or KYNA decreases colitis severity through effects on intestinal epithelial cells and T cells, involving Aryl hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR) activation and the rewiring of cellular energy metabolism. Furthermore, direct modulation of the endogenous tryptophan metabolism, using the recombinant enzyme aminoadipate aminotransferase (AADAT), responsible for the generation of XANA and KYNA, was protective in rodent colitis models.

Prior research indicated that, in contrast to other ruminants, PPs in the small intestine of Bactrian camels are found in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum and display polymorphism. Using this information, we analyzed the microbial and metabolic characteristics in various segments of the Bactrian camel's small intestine to further elucidate how the immune system varies across different regions. Methods In this study, the microbiota and metabolite of 36 intestinal mucosal samples, including duodenal (D-PPs), jejunal (J-PPs), and ileal PPs (I-PPs), were profiled for six Bactrian camels using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). To confirm meaningful associations, we conducted connection analyses on the significantly different objects identified in each group's results. ELISA was used to analyze the levels of IgA, IgG, and IgM in the same tissues. Results The microbiota and metabolite profiles of J-PPs and I-PPs were found to be similar, whereas those of D-PPs were more distinct. In J-PPs and I-PPs, the dominant bacterial genera included Clostridium, Turicibacter, and Shigella. In contrast, D-PPs had a significant increase in the abundance of Prevotella, Fibrobacter, and Succinobacter. Regarding the metabolomics, D-PPs exhibited high levels of polypeptides, acetylcholine, and histamine. On the other hand, J-PPs and I-PPs were characterized by an enrichment of free amino acids, such as L-arginine, L-glutamic acid, and L-serine. These metabolic differences mainly involve amino acid production and metabolic processes. Furthermore, the distribution of intestinal immunoglobulins highlighted the specificity of D-PPs. Our results indicated that proinflammatory microbes and metabolites were significantly enriched in D-PPs. In contrast, J-PPs and I-PPs contained substances that more effectively enhance immune responses, as evidenced by the differential distribution of IgA, IgG, and IgM.

In this study, we investigated the functional role of the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)- stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signalling in renal inflammation and fibrosis.\n\n\nEXPERIMENTAL APPROACH\nMice with global cGAS deficiency or global or myeloid cell-specific STING deficiency or wild-type mice treated with RU.521, a selective cGAS inhibitor, were used to examine the role of cGAS-STING signalling in renal inflammation and fibrosis in a preclinical model of obstructive nephropathy in vivo. Bone marrow-derived macrophages were used to determine whether tubular epithelial cell-derived DNA can activate cGAS-STING signalling in vitro.\n\n\nKEY RESULTS\nFollowing obstructive injury, cGAS-STING signalling was activated in the kidneys during the development of renal fibrosis. Mice with deficiency of cGAS or STING exhibited significantly less macrophage proinflammatory activation, myofibroblast formation, total collagen deposition, and extracellular matrix (ECM) protein production in the kidneys following obstructive injury. Pharmacological inhibition of cGAS with RU.521 reduced macrophage proinflammatory activation, suppressed myofibroblast formation, and attenuated kidney fibrosis following obstructive injury. Mechanistically, cGAS-STING signalling in macrophages is activated by double-stranded DNA released from damaged tubular epithelial cells, which induces inflammatory responses.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS\nOur study identifies the cGAS-STING signalling pathway as a critical regulator of macrophage proinflammatory activation during the development of renal fibrosis.

This review provides a comprehensive state-of-the-art conceptual review of radiological features, clinical detection and classification challenges, pathophysiology, underlying biological mechanism(s) and risk factors/predictors associated with ARIA. We summarize the existing literature and current lines of evidence with ARIA-oedema/effusion (ARIA-E) and ARIA-haemosiderosis/microhaemorrhages (ARIA-H) seen across anti-amyloid clinical trials and therapeutic development. Both forms of ARIA may occur, often early, during anti-amyloid-\u03b2 monoclonal antibody treatment. Across randomized controlled trials, most ARIA cases were asymptomatic. Symptomatic ARIA-E cases often occurred at higher doses and resolved within 3\u20134 months or upon treatment cessation. Apolipoprotein E haplotype and treatment dosage are major risk factors for ARIA-E and ARIA-H. Presence of any microhaemorrhage on baseline MRI increases the risk of ARIA. ARIA shares many clinical, biological and pathophysiological features with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. There is a great need to conceptually link the evident synergistic interplay associated with such underlying conditions to allow clinicians and researchers to further understand, deliberate and investigate on the combined effects of these multiple pathophysiological processes. Moreover, this review article aims to better assist clinicians in detection (either observed via symptoms or visually on MRI), management based on appropriate use recommendations, and general preparedness and awareness when ARIA are observed as well as researchers in the fundamental understanding of the various antibodies in development and their associated risks of ARIA. To facilitate ARIA detection in clinical trials and clinical practice, we recommend the implementation of standardized MRI protocols and rigorous reporting standards.

By aligning genomes for 240 species, we identify bases that, when mutated, are likely to affect fitness and alter disease risk. At least 332 million bases (~10.7%) in the human genome are unusually conserved across species (evolutionarily constrained) relative to neutrally evolving repeats, and 4552 ultraconserved elements are nearly perfectly conserved. Of 101 million significantly constrained single bases, 80% are outside protein-coding exons and half have no functional annotations in the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) resource. Changes in genes and regulatory elements are associated with exceptional mammalian traits, such as hibernation, that could inform therapeutic development. Earth\u2019s vast and imperiled biodiversity offers distinctive power for identifying genetic variants that affect genome function and organismal phenotypes. Description INTRODUCTION A major challenge in genomics is discerning which bases among billions alter organismal phenotypes and affect health and disease risk. Evidence of past selective pressure on a base, whether highly conserved or fast evolving, is a marker of functional importance. Bases that are unchanged in all mammals may shape phenotypes that are essential for organismal health. Bases that are evolving quickly in some species, or changed only in species that share an adaptive trait, may shape phenotypes that support survival in specific niches. Identifying bases associated with exceptional capacity for cellular recovery, such as in species that hibernate, could inform therapeutic discovery. RATIONALE The power and resolution of evolutionary analyses scale with the number and diversity of species compared. By analyzing genomes for hundreds of placental mammals, we can detect which individual bases in the genome are exceptionally conserved (constrained) and likely to be functionally important in both coding and noncoding regions. By including species that represent all orders of placental mammals and aligning genomes using a method that does not require designating humans as the reference species, we explore unusual traits in other species. RESULTS Zoonomia\u2019s mammalian comparative genomics resources are the most comprehensive and statistically well-powered produced to date, with a protein-coding alignment of 427 mammals and a whole-genome alignment of 240 placental mammals representing all orders. We estimate that at least 10.7% of the human genome is evolutionarily conserved relative to neutrally evolving repeats and identify about 101 million significantly constrained single bases (false discovery rate < 0.05). We cataloged 4552 ultraconserved elements at least 20 bases long that are identical in more than 98% of the 240 placental mammals. Many constrained bases have no known function, illustrating the potential for discovery using evolutionary measures. Eighty percent are outside protein-coding exons, and half have no functional annotations in the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) resource. Constrained bases tend to vary less within human populations, which is consistent with purifying selection. Species threatened with extinction have few substitutions at constrained sites, possibly because severely deleterious alleles have been purged from their small populations. By pairing Zoonomia\u2019s genomic resources with phenotype annotations, we find genomic elements associated with phenotypes that differ between species, including olfaction, hibernation, brain size, and vocal learning. We associate genomic traits, such as the number of olfactory receptor genes, with physical phenotypes, such as the number of olfactory turbinals. By comparing hibernators and nonhibernators, we implicate genes involved in mitochondrial disorders, protection against heat stress, and longevity in this physiologically intriguing phenotype. Using a machine learning\u2013based approach that predicts tissue-specific cis-regulatory activity in hundreds of species using data from just a few, we associate changes in noncoding sequence with traits for which humans are exceptional: brain size and vocal learning. CONCLUSION Large-scale comparative genomics opens new opportunities to explore how genomes evolved as mammals adapted to a wide range of ecological niches and to discover what is shared across species and what is distinctively human. High-quality data for consistently defined phenotypes are necessary to realize this potential. Through partnerships with researchers in other fields, comparative genomics can address questions in human health and basic biology while guiding efforts to protect the biodiversity that is essential to these discoveries.

If the genetic basis for convergent evolution is predictable to some extent, it may be possible to infer organismic phenotypes and the capability of organisms to utilize new ecological resources based on genome sequence data. While repeated amino acid changes have been studied in association with convergent evolution, relatively little is known about the potential contribution of repeated gene copy number changes. In this study, we explore whether gene copy number changes of particular gene families are linked to diet shifts in mammals and assess whether trophic ecology can be inferred from the copy numbers of a specific set of gene families. Using 86 mammalian genome sequences, we identified 24 gene families with a trend toward higher copy numbers in herbivores, carnivores, and omnivores, even after phylogenetic corrections. We were able to confirm previous findings on genes such as amylase, olfactory receptors, and xenobiotic metabolism genes, and identify novel gene families whose copy numbers correlate with dietary patterns. For example, omnivores exhibited higher copy numbers of genes encoding regulators of translation. We also established a discriminant function based on the copy numbers of 13 gene families that can help predict trophic ecology to some extent.

The amassing knowledge that the inhabited microbiome regulates the gut physiology and immune functions in IBD, has led researchers to explore the effectiveness of prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics in treating IBD. This therapeutic approach focuses on restoring the dynamic balance between the microflora and host defense mechanisms in the intestinal mucosa to prevent the onset and persistence of intestinal inflammation. Numerous microbial strains and carbohydrate blends, along with their combinations have been examined in experimental colitis models and clinical trials, and the results indicated that it can be an attractive therapeutic strategy for the suppression of inflammation, remission induction, and relapse prevention in IBD with minimal side effects. Several mechanisms of action of probiotics (for e.g., Lactobacillus species, and Bifidobacterium species) have been reported such as suppression of pathogen growth by releasing certain antimicrobial mediators (lactic and hydrogen peroxide, acetic acid, and bacteriocins), immunomodulation and initiation of an immune response, enhancement of barrier activity, and suppression of human T-cell proliferation. Prebiotics such as lactulose, lactosucrose, oligofructose, and inulin have been found to induce the growth of certain types of host microflora, resulting in an enriched enteric function. These non-digestible food dietary components have been reported to exert anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the expression of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1-related cytokines while augmenting interleukin-10 levels. Although pro-and prebiotics has established their efficacy in healthy subjects, a better understanding of the luminal ecosystem is required to determine which specific bacterial strain or combination of probiotics and prebiotics would prove to be the ideal treatment for IBD.

New varieties of chili pepper plants resistant to saline and drought can be obtained through unconventional breeding (overexpression of the dehydrin gene). As a first step in assembling saline and drought-resistant chili plants, growth response and dehydrin gene expression tests were carried out from explants of chili pepper plants of the TM999 variety in vitro on salt and drought treatment media. This study aims to obtain information on the initial response to the growth and expression of the dehydrin gene from chili pepper plants of the TM999 variety before further research is carried out to increase the expression of the dehydrin gene through a molecular approach. The method used in this study is a complete randomized design with two treatments: Sodium chloride (NaCl) and polyethylene glycol (PEG-6000). The results obtained in this study showed that chili pepper varieties TM999 were more tolerant of drought stress than salinity based on several growth response data in both treatments.

Results The foliar spray of SA partially mitigated these salt-induced effects, as evidenced by a reduction of malondialdehyde content, and improvements of leaf K+/Na+ ratios, pigment biosynthesis, and electron transport efficiency under NaCl stress. Additionally, SA increased the contents of total phenolic compound and soluble protein by 16.2% and 28.7% to alleviate NaCl-induced oxidative damage. Under salt stressed conditions, the activities of antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase, catalase, and peroxidase increased by 4.2%~14.4% in SA sprayed tobacco seedlings. Exogenous SA also increased ascorbate and glutathione levels and reduced their reduced forms by increasing the activities of glutathione reductase, ascorbate peroxidase, monodehydroascorbate reductase and dehydroascorbate reductase. qRT\u2212PCR analysis revealed that the key genes regulating SA biosynthesis, carbon assimilation, the antioxidant system and the ascorbate\u2212glutathione cycle were activated by SA under conditions of salt stress.

Methods A differential analysis was performed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between DR and control samples using the GSE94019 dataset from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Pearson correlation analysis was then utilized to select genes linked to mitochondrial function and PCD (M-PCD). Candidate genes were identified by overlapping DR-DEGs and M-PCD genes, followed by functional annotation.

An optimized cell-penetrating peptide derivative, bxyPenetratin (bxyWP), is used to non-covalently complex with the anti-VEGF protein aflibercept (AFL) via reversible hydrophobic interaction. The interaction is crucial for AFL delivery, neither impairing the affinity of AFL to pathological VEGF, nor being interfered by endogenous proteins in tear fluids.

In recent years, the emergency of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) has revolutionized the management of HCC. Especially, the combination of atezolizumab (anti-PD1) and bevacizumab (anti-VEGF) has been approved by the FDA as the first-line treatment for advanced HCC. Despite great breakthrough in systemic therapy, HCC continues to portend a poor prognosis owing to drug resistance and frequent recurrence. The tumor microenvironment (TME) of HCC is a complex and structured mixture characterized by abnormal angiogenesis, chronic inflammation, and dysregulated extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, collectively contributing to the immunosuppressive milieu that in turn prompts HCC proliferation, invasion, and metastasis. The tumor microenvironment coexists and interacts with various immune cells to maintain the development of HCC. It is widely accepted that a dysfunctional tumor-immune ecosystem can lead to the failure of immune surveillance. The immunosuppressive TME is an external cause for immune evasion in HCC consisting of 1) immunosuppressive cells; 2) co-inhibitory signals; 3) soluble cytokines and signaling cascades; 4) metabolically hostile tumor microenvironment; 5) the gut microbiota that affects the immune microenvironment. Importantly, the effectiveness of immunotherapy largely depends on the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). Also, the gut microbiota and metabolism profoundly affect the immune microenvironment. Understanding how TME affects HCC development and progression will contribute to better preventing HCC-specific immune evasion and overcoming resistance to already developed therapies.

One approach is to stimulate antigen-presenting cells (APCs) to uptake neoantigens. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTb) contains pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) recognized by APCs and adhesion molecules that facilitate MTb invasion of APCs. Therefore, we suggest using MTb as a carrier to enhance APC phagocytosis of neoantigens, thereby promoting antigen cross-presentation. Methods The successful preparation of the MTb carrier (phMTb) was confirmed through electron and confocal microscopy. Fluorescence microscopy was used to detect PAMPs and adhesion molecules on phMTb as well as to observe its role in aiding dendritic cells (DCs) in antigen uptake into endosomes or lysosomes. Flow cytometry was used to assess the retention of PAMPs and adhesion molecules on phMTb, investigate antigen uptake by DCs, evaluate their activation and maturation status, examine the presentation of tumor neoantigens, and analyze immune cells in draining lymph nodes and tumor tissues. The efficacy of phMTb vaccine formulations in combination with anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antibody therapy was assessed using the MC38 mouse tumor models. Adverse effects were evaluated through H&E staining of major organs, assessment of reproductive capability and detection of biochemical indices. Results The engineered porous hollow phMTb carrier successfully encapsulated model tumor neoantigens, with or without the adjuvant CpG. The phMTb retained PAMPs and adhesion molecules on its surface, similar to the parental MTb, thereby enhancing DC uptake of phMTb and its formulations containing tumor neoantigens and CpG. Vaccines formulated with phMTb facilitated DC maturation, activation, cross-presentation of tumor neoantigens, and promoted migration of phMTb-laden DCs to lymph nodes, enhancing effector and memory CD8+ T lymphocyte function. In murine tumor models, immunization with phMTb-formulated neoantigen vaccines elicited a robust tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte immune response with minimal adverse effects. Additionally, vaccination with phMTb-formulated neoantigen vaccines effectively reversed the tumor\u2019s immune-suppressive microenvironment.

Traditional models like cell cultures and animal studies provide valuable insights but have limitations in replicating the complexity of human disease and raise ethical concerns. By focusing on bioreactor-based in vitro systems, which can mimic the physical and chemical environment of the gastrointestinal tract, this study aims to provide more accurate models for studying cancer and its treatment side effects. These advancements could lead to better insights into disease mechanisms, potentially improving treatment strategies and benefiting the broader research community. Abstract Human diseases are multifaceted, starting with alterations at the cellular level, damaging organs and their functions, and disturbing interactions and immune responses. In vitro systems offer clarity and standardisation, which are crucial for effectively modelling disease. These models aim not to replicate every disease aspect but to dissect specific ones with precision. Controlled environments allow researchers to isolate key variables, eliminate confounding factors and elucidate disease mechanisms more clearly. Technological progress has rapidly advanced model systems. Initially, 2D cell culture models explored fundamental cell interactions. The transition to 3D cell cultures and organoids enabled more life-like tissue architecture and enhanced intercellular interactions. Advanced bioreactor-based devices now recreate the physicochemical environments of specific organs, simulating features like perfusion and the gastrointestinal tract\u2019s mucus layer, enhancing physiological relevance. These systems have been simplified and adapted for high-throughput research, marking significant progress.

The aim was to evaluate the intake of phytoestrogens and the estrogenic effect of the diet of women at university in Chihuahua (Mexico). In total, 400 female university students individually filled out a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) that included 120 foods. Estimates of the intake of phytoestrogen (genistein, daidzein, biochanin A, formononetin, matairesinol, coumestrol, enterolactone, secoisoresinol, enterodiol) in the subjects\u2019 daily diet were based on published reports. Quantification of phytoestrogens was expressed in \u00b5g day\u22121. The estrogenic effect of those compound identified according to the foods consumed was estimated using the in vitro E-SCREN test. SPSS v.22.0 (IBM, Chicago, IL, USA) was applied for statistical analysis following descriptive analysis and stepwise regression. p < 0.050 was taken as significant.

This study aimed to investigate miR-208 potential as an oncogene in breast cancer by examining its impact on cell motility and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Tissue samples from 25 Iraqi women with malignant breast cancer and 25 with benign breast cancer were analysed. Total RNA was extracted from the samples and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed using SYBR Green technology to measure miR-208 expression levels. Tissue samples from both benign and malignant tumours were analysed to determine U6 gene expression. The analysis showed that the typical Ct values for benign and malignant samples were 29.83 and 29.67 respectively. No significant difference in U6 expression levels was detected between benign and malignant tumours. However, upon comparing the initial malignant and the benign tumours samples, miRNA-208 \u0394\u0394CT values were found to be substantially lower (-7.105 and -0.781 respectively) with a p-value of less than 0.05.

This study explored the therapeutic potential of combined curcumin (CUR) and metformin (MET) treatment in CRC models. Our findings indicate that the combination treatment (COMB) effectively downregulates the expression of divalent metal transporter\u20101 (DMT\u20101), leading to a reduction in cell proliferation aligned with suppression of the pAKT/mTOR/Cyclin D1 signaling pathway. The COMB increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, triggering activation of the NRF2/KEAP1 pathway. This pathway elicits an antioxidant response to manage oxidative stress in CRC cell lines. Interestingly, the response of NRF2 varied between CT26 and HCT116 cells. Moreover, our study highlights the induction of apoptosis and autophagy, as evidenced by upregulations in Bax/Bcl\u20102 ratios and autophagy\u2010related protein expressions. Notably, the COMB promoted lipid peroxidation and downregulated xCT levels, suggesting the induction of ferroptosis. Ferroptosis has been shown to activate autophagy, which helps eliminate cells potentially damaged by the increased oxidative stress. Furthermore, the COMB effectively diminished the migratory ability of CRC cells. In vivo experiments using CRC\u2010bearing mouse models, the results confirmed the anti\u2010tumor efficacy of the COMB, leading to substantial inhibition of tumor growth without inducing general toxicity. In conclusion, our study suggests that combining CUR with MET holds promise as a potential option for CRC treatment, with critical mechanisms likely involving ROS elevation, autophagy, and ferroptosis.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-11-28", "synthetic_support_claim": "The combined curcumin and metformin treatment induces ferroptosis and suppresses tumor growth in CRC models.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Combined curcumin and metformin treatment prevents CRC metastasis to distant organs in clinical settings."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "8831d4a34048912ad86f89f05962d8ede1c3740a", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8831d4a34048912ad86f89f05962d8ede1c3740a", "title": "Exploring the Pathophysiological Mechanisms of Acute Gastrointestinal Injury in Acute Exacerbations of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: An Integrative Review", "abstract": "Acute gastrointestinal injury (AGI) complicating acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) represents a complex multisystem pathophysiological phenomenon involving systemic inflammation, hypoxemia, microcirculatory dysfunction, and gut microbiota dysbiosis.

Specifically in skeletal muscle, remarkable plasticity is demonstrated by the remodeling of muscle structure and function in terms of muscular size, force, endurance, and contractile velocity as a result of the functional demands induced by various types of exercise training. This plasticity, and the mechanistic basis for adaptations to skeletal muscle in response to exercise training, is underpinned by activation and/or repression of molecular pathways and processes induced in response to each individual acute exercise session. These pathways include the transduction of signals arising from neuronal, mechanical, metabolic, and hormonal stimuli through complex signal transduction networks, which are linked to a myriad of effector proteins involved in the regulation of pre- and post-transcriptional processes, and protein translation and degradation processes. This review therefore describes acute exercise-induced signal transduction and the molecular responses to acute exercise in skeletal muscle including emerging concepts such as epigenetic pre- and post-transcriptional regulation, and the regulation of protein translation and degradation.

We used electrical stimulation\u2010induced muscle contraction as a resistance exercise model (5 sets \u00d7\u200910 times of 3\u2009s of 100\u2010Hz electrical stimulation) on the tibialis anterior muscle of rats and measured the transcriptome in the muscle before and at 0, 1, 3, 6, and 12\u2009h after muscle contractions by RNA sequencing.

We found that the function of the upregulated genes differed after muscle contractions depending on their response rate. Genes related to muscle differentiation and response to mechanical stimulus were enriched in the sustainedly upregulated genes. Furthermore, there was a positive correlation between the magnitude of upregulated mRNA expression and the corresponding protein expression level at 12\u2009h after muscle contractions.

Our aim was to examine skeletal muscle proteome response to 10-week RT (RT1) followed by 10-week training cessation (i.e. detraining, DT), and finally, 10-week retraining (RT2). Thirty healthy, untrained participants conducted either periodic RT (RT1-DT-RT2, n=17) or a 10-week no-training control period (n=13) followed by 20 weeks of RT (n=11). RT included twice-weekly supervised whole-body RT sessions, and resting vastus lateralis biopsies were obtained every ten weeks for proteomics analysis using high-end DIA-PASEF\u2019s mass spectrometry. The first RT period altered 150 proteins (93% increased) involved in e.g. energy metabolism and protein processing compared with minor changes during the no-training control period. The proteome adaptations were similar after the second RT compared to baseline demonstrating reproducibility in proteome adaptations to RT. Many of the proteins induced by RT1 were reversed towards baseline after detraining and increased again after retraining. These reversible proteins were especially involved in aerobic energy metabolism. Interestingly, several proteins increased after RT1 remain elevated after detraining, including carbonyl reductase 1 (CBR1) and proteins involved in muscle contraction, cytoskeleton and calcium-binding. Amongst the latter, calcium-activated protease calpain-2 (CAPN2) has been recently identified as an epigenetic muscle memory gene. We show that resistance training evokes retained protein levels even after 2.5 months of no training. This is the first study to demonstrate a potential proteomic memory of resistance training-induced muscle growth in human skeletal muscle. Key points Repeated resistance training in humans separated by a training break (i.e. detraining) enables the identification of temporal protein signatures over the training, detraining, and retraining periods as well as studying reproducibility of protein changes to resistance training. Muscle proteome adaptations were similar after a second period of resistance training when compared to baseline, demonstrating reproducibility in proteome adaptations to earlier resistance training. Many of the proteins induced by resistance training were reversed towards baseline after detraining and increased again after retraining. These reversible proteins were especially involved in aerobic energy metabolism. Several proteins increased after resistance training remain elevated after detraining, including carbonyl reductase 1 (CBR1) and calcium-binding proteins such as calpain-2 (CAPN2), a recently identified epigenetic muscle memory gene. Human skeletal muscle experiences retained protein changes following resistance training persisting over two months demonstrating a potential proteomic memory of resistance training-induced muscle growth. Human skeletal muscle proteome response was investigated after 10-week resistance training (RT1) followed by 10-week training cessation (i.e. detraining, DT), and finally, 10-week retraining (RT2).

The effects of the gut microbiota on the enteric nervous system (ENS) in the adult intestine, however, remain poorly understood. In the current study, we investigated the effects of the gut microbiota on the ENS. Male C57BL/6 SPF mice at 12 weeks of age were given a cocktail of four antibiotics (ABX) orally to induce dysbiosis (ABX mice). As early as six hours after ABX administration, the weight of the cecum of ABX mice increased to be significantly greater than that of vehicle-treated animals; moreover, ABX-induced dysbiosis reduced the density of enteric nerve fibers (marked by tubulin-\u03b23 immunoreactivity) in the lamina propria of the proximal colon to approximately 60% that of control. TAK242, a TLR4 antagonist, significantly lowered the nerve fiber density in the lamina propria of the proximal colonic mucosa to approximately 60% that of vehicle-treated SPF mice. We thus developed and tested the hypothesis that mucosal glia expressing TLR4 are activated by enteric bacteria and release neurotrophic factors that contribute to the maintenance of enteric neural circuits. Neurotrophic factors in the mucosa of the SPF mouse proximal colon were examined immunohistochemically. Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) was abundantly expressed in the lamina propria; most of the CNTF immunoreactivity was observed in mucosal glia (marked by S100\u03b2 immunoreactivity). Administration of CNTF (subcutaneously, 0.3 mg/kg, 3 doses, 2 hours apart) to ABX mice significantly increased mucosal nerve fiber density in the ABX mouse proximal colon to nearly control levels. The effect of CNTF on enteric mucosal nerve fibers was examined in isolated preparations of proximal colon of ABX mice. As it did in vivo, exposure to CNTF in vitro significantly increased enteric mucosal nerve fiber density in the ABX-treated colon. In conclusion, our evidence suggests that gut microbiota constitutively activate TLR4 signaling in enteric mucosal glia, which secrete CNTF in response.

Heritability enrichment analysis and disease variant mapping demonstrated that smooth muscle cells (SMCs) harbor the greatest genetic risk for CAD.

It is believed that animals learn to predict rewards by updating predictions whenever the outcome deviates from expectations, and that such reward prediction errors (RPEs) are signaled by the mesolimbic dopamine system\u2014a key controller of learning. However, instead of learning prospective predictions from RPEs, animals can infer predictions by learning the retrospective cause of rewards. Hence, whether mesolimbic dopamine instead conveys a causal associative signal that sometimes resembles RPE remains unknown. We developed an algorithm for retrospective causal learning and found that mesolimbic dopamine release conveys causal associations but not RPE, thereby challenging the dominant theory of reward learning. Our results reshape the conceptual and biological framework for associative learning. Description A framework for associative learning How do animals learn to associate environmental cues with delayed outcomes such as rewards? Temporal difference reinforcement learning (TDRL) is the most widely accepted model of reward learning. Jeong et al. now challenge this view by introducing a formal account and model of dopamine\u2019s role in learning. They present an algorithm that supports retrospective causal learning, allowing animals to infer the causes of an event. To directly compare the two competing hypotheses, the authors devised eight experimental tests. In each of the eight tests in every animal tested, they challenge the TDRL signaling model and show that every observation is consistent with their causal inference algorithm. These findings provide a fresh physiological and theoretical framework for associative learning in the brain. \u2014PRS Animals learns retrospectively that there are causal associations of conditioned stimuli and reward. INTRODUCTION How do animals learn to prospectively predict delayed outcomes such as rewards from environmental cues? Considerable evidence shows that the neuromodulator dopamine is critical for such associative learning. This evidence has supported the hypothesis that midbrain dopamine neurons and nucleus accumbens dopamine release signal a temporal difference (TD) reward prediction error (RPE)\u2014the difference between received and predicted reward. Hence, it is widely believed that animals use the TD algorithm to learn reward predictions. Recent results, however, suggest that dopamine signaling may not be fully consistent with RPEs. Despite this, the TDRPE hypothesis remains the best explanation of associative learning in the brain because no alternate model exists that successfully explains experimental observations inconsistent with TDRPE while also capturing experimental phenomena currently best explained by TDRPE. RATIONALE Here, we propose a new theory of associative learning. Since causes must precede outcomes, we propose that animals learn associations by looking back in memory to infer causes of meaningful outcomes such as rewards. For instance, imagine a child learning that the bell of an ice cream van predicts ice cream. Learning what cues precede ice cream (retrospective) is simpler than learning the future outcome of a near-infinite number of cues, only a few of which may result in ice cream (prospective). Thus, once a meaningful outcome such as ice cream is realized, the child can look back in memory to infer that the bell causes ice cream. Such learning only requires a memory of the previous bell when ice cream is received, and not active maintenance of predictions of ice cream prior to its receipt. We developed a model based on this concept\u2014adjusted net contingency for causal relations (ANCCR, pronounced \u201canchor\u201d)\u2014and tested whether this model is capable of learning reward predictions and explaining nucleus accumbens dopamine release better than TDRPE. In this model, a current event is considered a \u201cmeaningful causal target\u201d (i.e., an event whose cause should be learned) when it is either innately meaningful (e.g., ice cream) or when it has been learned to be a cause of other meaningful causal targets (e.g., bell of ice cream van after it has been learned to be a cause of ice cream). Our central hypothesis is that mesolimbic dopamine conveys the learned meaningfulness of events by signaling ANCCR and guides causal learning of the current event. RESULTS We first showed using simulations that ANCCR identifies relationships between events spread in time (e.g., cues and rewards) better than TD without loss of generality across timescales. Next, we showed that many classic experimental results supporting TDRPE coding are also consistent with ANCCR signaling. Thus, we sought to test dopamine activity during experiments that distinguish these two hypotheses. To this end, we devised eleven experimental tests that are capable of qualitatively distinguishing between both hypotheses. We performed these tests by using fiber photometry of an optical dopamine sensor (dLight1.3b) to measure nucleus accumbens dopamine release. We did so across tasks including repeated exposure to random rewards, variations of cue-reward learning, and sequential conditioning with and without optogenetic inhibition of dopamine release. In all cases, we observed that the results were inconsistent with TDRPE but consistent with ANCCR. CONCLUSION Collectively, these results demonstrate that dopamine function can be better understood as providing a signal to initiate learning of causes of a meaningful stimulus. These results reshape current understanding of the algorithms and neural mechanisms of associative learning in the brain. Retrospective causal learning of meaningful outcomes. How do we learn that environmental stimuli (e.g., bell of ice cream van) predict rewards (e.g., ice cream)? The standard model learns prospectively using prediction errors. Here, we present an alternative that learns predictions using retrospective identification of causes of meaningful outcomes. These models make different predictions about mesolimbic dopamine, a critical controller of learning.

Recently, it has been shown that the main sources of catecholamines to the hippocampus, ventral tegmental area (VTA) and locus coeruleus (LC), may have overlapping release of neurotransmitters and effects on the hippocampus. Therefore, to dissect the impacts of both VTA and LC circuits on hippocampal function, a thorough examination of how these pathways might differentially operate during behavior and learning is necessary. We therefore utilized two-photon microscopy to functionally image the activity of VTA and LC axons within the CA1 region of the dorsal hippocampus in head-fixed male mice navigating linear paths within virtual reality (VR) environments. We found that within familiar environments some VTA axons and the vast majority of LC axons showed a correlation with the animals\u2019 running speed. However, as mice approached previously learned rewarded locations, a large majority of VTA axons exhibited a gradual ramping-up of activity, peaking at the reward location. In contrast, LC axons displayed a pre-movement signal predictive of the animal\u2019s transition from immobility to movement. Interestingly, a marked divergence emerged following a switch from the familiar to novel VR environments. Many LC axons showed large increases in activity that remained elevated for over a minute, while the previously observed VTA axon ramping-to-reward dynamics disappeared during the same period. In conclusion, these findings highlight distinct roles of VTA and LC catecholaminergic inputs in the dorsal CA1 hippocampal region.

Methods This study involved treating seeds and seedlings with two distinct concentrations of astringent seeds water extracts under the aluminum ion stress. Then the germination of seeds and growth of seedlings were evaluated and compared. Results Under aluminum stress, both seed germination and seedling growth were notably inhibited. Treatment with a low-concentration of the extract significantly alleviated this inhibition. Root elongation in the seedlings increased by 36.95% compared to the control group, and the aluminum ion accumulation at the root tips was reduced by 38.89% relative to the aluminum-stressed group. This treatment also normalized the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) in the roots and leaves, enhanced the activities of antioxidative enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), and restored the levels of endogenous hormones including gibberellin (GA3), indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), methyl jasmonate (Ja-ME), and abscisic acid (ABA). Furthermore, the low-concentration of the extract positively impacted the disorganized chloroplast structures. In contrast, a high-concentration of the extract failed to revert most of these stress indicators.

Recent studies suggest that these effects are partly mediated through the regulation of macrophage polarization, wherein macrophages differentiate into pro-inflammatory M1 or anti-inflammatory M2 phenotypes. Our review highlights how resveratrol modulates macrophage polarization through various signaling pathways to achieve therapeutic effects. For example, resveratrol can activate the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) pathway and inhibit the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT3) and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P)-YAP signaling axes, promoting M1 polarization or suppressing M2 polarization, thereby inhibiting tumor growth. Conversely, it can promote M2 polarization or suppress M1 polarization by inhibiting the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway or activating the PI3K/Akt and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathways, thus alleviating inflammatory responses. Notably, the effect of resveratrol on macrophage polarization is concentration-dependent; moderate concentrations tend to promote M1 polarization, while higher concentrations may favor M2 polarization. This concentration dependence offers new perspectives for clinical treatment but also underscores the necessity for precise dosage control when using resveratrol.

Among the different stresses, extreme temperatures (heat and cold) disturb plant growth and development, reduces productivity, and in severe cases, leads to plant death. The plants have developed numerous strategies to safeguard themselves against the detrimental impact of temperature stress. Exposure to stress evokes the accumulation of various metabolites like sugars, sugar alcohols, organic acids, and amino acids. Plants accumulate the amino acid proline (Pro) in response to several abiotic stresses, including temperature stress. Proline abundance may result from de novo synthesis, hydrolysis of proteins, and reduced utilization or degradation. Pro also imparts stress tolerance by maintaining the osmotic balance (still controversial), cell turgidity, and indirectly modulating the metabolism of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, the crosstalk of Pro with other osmoprotectants and signaling molecules like glycine betaine, abscisic acid, nitric oxide, hydrogen sulfide, soluble sugars, etc., helps in strengthening the protective mechanism under stressful environments. The development of temperature-smart cultivars can be achieved by manipulating the biosynthesis of Pro through genetic engineering. Therefore, this review presented an overview of plant responses to extreme temperatures and an outline of the Pro metabolism under extreme temperatures. The exogenous application of Pro as a \"shield molecule\" under extreme temperatures is also presented. Proline crosstalk and interaction with other molecules have also been discussed. Finally, the potential of genetic engineering of Pro-related genes has been explained to develop temperature-smart plants.

The objective of this study was to investigate the ability of postbiotic and paraprobiotic substances to regulate oxidative stress and inflammation. We hypothesized that both postbiotics and paraprobiotics could demonstrated significant efficacy in reducing oxidative stress and inflammation, with distinct differences in their effectiveness. A total of 88 Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains were assessed for antioxidant activity.

However, the connection between the mucosa and systemic autoimmunity in RA remains unclear. Using dual immunoglobulin A (IgA) and IgG family plasmablast\u2013derived monoclonal autoantibodies obtained from peripheral blood of individuals at risk for RA, we identified cross-reactivity between RA-relevant autoantigens and bacterial taxa in the closely related families Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae. After generating bacterial isolates within the Lachnospiraceae/Ruminococcaceae genus Subdoligranulum from the feces of an individual, we confirmed monoclonal antibody binding and CD4+ T cell activation in individuals with RA compared to control individuals. In addition, when Subdoligranulum isolate 7 but not isolate 1 colonized germ-free mice, it stimulated TH17 cell expansion, serum RA\u2013relevant IgG autoantibodies, and joint swelling reminiscent of early RA, with histopathology characterized by antibody deposition and complement activation. Systemic immune responses were likely due to mucosal invasion along with the generation of colon-isolated lymphoid follicles driving increased fecal and serum IgA by isolate 7, because B and CD4+ T cell depletion not only halted intestinal immune responses but also eliminated detectable clinical disease. In aggregate, these findings demonstrate a mechanism of RA pathogenesis through which a specific intestinal strain of bacteria can drive systemic autoantibody generation and joint-centered antibody deposition and immune activation. Description An autoantibody-targeted Subdoligranulum strain activates T cells in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis and drives arthritis in mice. A bacterial driver of arthritis Autoantibodies can be detected in individuals at risk for developing rheumatoid arthritis (RA) before development of clinical disease. The source of these autoantibodies, however, remains unclear. Here, Chriswell et al. identified that IgG and IgA autoantibodies from individuals who are at risk for RA cross-react against gut bacteria in the Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae families. Further analysis identified a bacterial strain from the Subdoligranulum genus that was associated with autoantibody development.

Baseline sampling included 124 participants (30 progressed to RA), with longitudinal sampling of 19 participants (5 progressed to RA) over 15 months at five timepoints. Gut microbiome taxonomic alterations were investigated using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and confirmed with shotgun metagenomic DNA sequencing on 49 samples.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt baseline, CCP+ at risk progressors showed significant differences in Prevotellaceae abundance compared with non-progressors, contingent on intrinsic RA risk factors and time to progression. Longitudinal sampling revealed gut microbiome instability in progressors 10 months before RA onset, a phenomenon absent in non-progressors. This may indicate a late microbial shift before RA onset, with Prevotellaceae contributing but not dominating these changes. Structural changes in the gut microbiome during arthritis development were associated with increased amino acid metabolism.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThese data suggest conflicting reports on Prevotellaceae overabundance are likely due to sampling within a heterogeneous population along a dynamic disease spectrum, with certain Prevotellaceae strains/clades possibly contributing to the establishment and/or progression of RA.

We hypothesized that this response is not limited to the site of CAP application and it is transmitted through the plant. The resulting stress response can influence the plant microbiome on the intact plant. These hypotheses were tested by the application of CAP to live sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum var. Kiera). A single upper leaf of the plant underwent a 60 s CAP treatment at three different wattage intensity levels. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in directly treated leaves and leaves in the vicinity of the treatment site (i.e., one, two, or three nodes away) was measured using the fluorescein degradation assay (ex/em: 485/525). Leaves directly exposed to CAP showed a marked increase in ROS production. Interestingly, basil leaves not directly treated by CAP also showed a significant (p < 0.05) increase in ROS generation compared to untreated control, extending to the two nearest nodes from the treatment site in all plants tested. The leaf microbiomes were evaluated using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. CAP appeared to drive restructuring of the leaf microbiota profiles, despite maintaining a similar \u03b1\u2010diversity. CAP treatment intensity led to significant differences (p < 0.05) in the relative abundances of a variety of dominant bacterial families (e.g., Psuedomonadaceae and Streptomycetaceae) and phyla, and the effects on certain taxa were dependent on leaf distance from the treatment site. CAP's ability to restructure plant microbiota may have applications to improve produce microbial safety and shelf\u2010life. Practical Application Cold atmospheric plasma induces a stress response in a living plant beyond the site of application. This response includes an increase in the production of reactive oxygen species that can trigger pathways to enhance the production of phytochemicals.

The inflammatory response immediately following these diseases profoundly impacts patient prognosis and recovery. Efficient resolution of inflammation is crucial not only for halting the inflammatory process but also for restoring tissue homeostasis. Efferocytosis, the phagocytic clearance of dying cells by phagocytes, especially microglia and macrophages, plays a critical role in this resolution process. Upon tissue injury, phagocytes are recruited to the site of damage where they engulf and clear dying cells through efferocytosis. Efferocytosis suppresses the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, stimulates the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, modulates the phenotype of microglia and macrophages, accelerates the resolution of inflammation, and promotes tissue repair. It involves three main stages: recognition, engulfment, and degradation of dying cells. Optimal removal of apoptotic cargo by phagocytes requires finely tuned machinery and associated modifications.

Both oxidative stress and inflammation are central to its pathophysiology, with trace elements such as zinc, copper, iron, manganese, magnesium, selenium, and calcium playing key roles in various cellular processes. Objective: This article reviews the role of trace elements in COPD, focusing on their involvement in disease pathogenesis and their therapeutic potential. Specifically, we examine the effects of zinc, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, selenium, and calcium in COPD. Methods: We performed a comprehensive narrative review of the literature across databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar, identifying studies that explore the therapeutic effects of trace elements in COPD. The studies included in the review consisted of cohort analyses, randomized controlled trials, and clinical investigations. Results: Zinc, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, selenium, and calcium are critical to both the pathophysiology and management of COPD. These trace elements contribute to the regulation of inflammation, the modulation of oxidative stress, and the maintenance of lung function. Zinc and copper, for instance, reduce oxidative stress and modulate immune responses, while iron is essential for oxygen transport. Magnesium, manganese, selenium, and calcium are vital for muscle function, respiratory performance, reducing inflammation, and improving pulmonary function. Conclusions: The minerals zinc, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, selenium, and calcium may contribute to beneficial effects as part of the standard therapeutic management of COPD.

However, it is not known whether terpenes derived from cannabis alone or in combination with the cannabinoid \u22069-THC impacts the function of alveolar macrophages, a specialized pulmonary innate immune cell that is important in host defense against pathogens. Therefore, we investigated the immunomodulatory properties of two commercially-available cannabis terpene mixtures on the function of MH-S cells, a murine alveolar macrophage cell line. MH-S cells were exposed to terpene mixtures at sublethal doses and to the bacterial product lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We measured inflammatory cytokine levels using qRT-PCR and multiplex ELISA, as well as phagocytosis of opsonized IgG-coated beads or mCherry-expressing Escherichia coli via flow cytometry. Neither terpene mixture affected inflammatory cytokine production by MH-S cells in response to LPS. Terpenes increased MH-S cell uptake of opsonized beads but had no effect on phagocytosis of E. coli. Addition of \u22069-THC to terpenes did not potentiate cytotoxicity nor phagocytosis.

However, as the list of omics technologies continues to grow, the field of bioinformatics has changed in two fundamental ways. Despite enormous success in expanding our understanding of the biological world, the failure of bulk methods to account for biologically important variability among cells of the same or different type has led to a major shift toward single-cell and spatially resolved omics methods, which attempt to disentangle the conflicting signals contained in heterogeneous samples by examining individual cells or cell clusters. The second major shift has been the attempt to integrate two or more different classes of omics data in a single multimodal analysis to identify patterns that bridge biological layers.

Cellular stress is a condition that leads to disrupted homeostasis by extrinsic and intrinsic factors. Among other stressors, hypoxia is a driving force for breast cancer (BC) progression and a general hallmark of solid tumors. Thus, intratumoral hypoxia is an important determinant of invasion, metastasis, treatment failure, prognosis, and patient mortality. Acquisition of the epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype is also a consequence of tumor hypoxia. The cellular response to hypoxia is mainly regulated by the hypoxia signaling pathway, governed by hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), mainly HIF1\u03b1. HIFs are a family of transcription factors (TFs), which induce the expression of target genes involved in cell survival and proliferation, metabolic reprogramming, angiogenesis, resisting apoptosis, invasion, and metastasis. HIF1\u03b1 cooperates with a large number of other TFs. In this review, we focused on the crosstalk and cooperation between HIF1\u03b1 and other TFs involved in the cellular response to hypoxia in BC. We identified a cluster of TFs, proposed as the HIF1\u03b1-TF interactome, that orchestrates the transcription of target genes involved in hypoxia, due to their post-translational modifications (PTMs), including phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, ubiquitination/deubiquitination, SUMOylation, hydroxylation, acetylation, S-nitrosylation, and palmitoylation. PTMs of these HIF1\u03b1-related TFs drive their stability and activity, degradation and turnover, and the bidirectional translocation between the cytoplasm or plasma membrane and nucleus of BC cells, as well as the transcription/activation of proteins encoded by oncogenes or inactivation of tumor suppressor target genes.

Increased levels of oxidative stress (OS) reduce the antioxidant defenses, affect the autophagy/mitophagy processes, and the regulatory mechanisms of cell survival, promoting inflammation in the lung. In fact, OS potentiate the inflammatory activities in the lung, favoring the progression of chronic airway diseases. OS increases the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), including superoxide anions (O2\u2212), hydroxyl radicals (OH) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), by the transformation of oxygen through enzymatic and non-enzymatic reactions. In this manner, OS reduces endogenous antioxidant defenses in both nucleated and non-nucleated cells.

To better understand the molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets of PND, this narrative review synthesized evidence from peer-reviewed studies, identified through comprehensive searches of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science. Key findings highlight neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, neurotransmitter imbalances, microvascular changes, and white matter lesions as central to PND pathophysiology, with particular parallels to encephalocele- and sepsis-associated cognitive impairments. Among these, neuroinflammation, mediated by pathways such as the NLRP3 inflammasome and blood\u2013brain barrier disruption, emerges as a pivotal driver, triggering cascades that exacerbate neuronal injury. Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction synergistically amplify these effects, while neurotransmitter imbalances and microvascular alterations, including white matter lesions, contribute to synaptic dysfunction and cognitive decline.

The onset of the neurodegenerative process is triggered decades before the first symptoms appear, probably due to a combination of genomic and epigenetic phenomena. Therefore, the primary objective of any effective treatment is to intercept the disease process in its presymptomatic phases. Since the approval of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (Tacrine, Donepezil, Rivastigmine, Galantamine) and Memantine, between 1993 and 2003, no new drug was approved by the FDA until the advent of immunotherapy with Aducanumab in 2021 and Lecanemab in 2023. Over the past decade, more than 10,000 new compounds with potential action on some pathogenic components of AD have been tested. The limitations of these anti-AD treatments have stimulated the search for multi-target (MT) drugs. In recent years, more than 1000 drugs with potential MT function have been studied in AD models. MT drugs aim to address the complex and multifactorial nature of the disease.

This study investigated the role of food insecurity as an effect modifier between the gut microbiome, including groups of gut microbes (microbial cliques), and RCI. Methods Data came from the Survey of the Health of Wisconsin and its ancillary Wisconsin Microbiome Study. The analytical sample (n = 360) included adult participants with complete data on food insecurity, RCI, and 16S rRNA sequencing data from stool samples. A \u201cmini-cog\u201d memory test was implemented to assess RCI. Food insecurity was assessed using a set of survey-based questions. Alpha diversity and individual taxa associations with RCI were estimated using linear regression. Microbial cliques associated with RCI were identified using an interpretable machine-learning-based algorithm. All analyses were stratified by food insecurity level, and regression models were adjusted for relevant confounders. Results Food insecurity status was weakly associated with RCI (b = 0.06, 95%CI=[0.00, 0.12]). Gut microbiome a-diversity had an inverse association with RCI in both the food secure (b=\u22120.08, 95%CI=[\u22120.15, \u22120.02]) and insecure groups (b=\u22120.09, 95%CI=[\u22120.26, 0.07]).

The goal was to understand how these heavy metals impact the growth, antioxidant systems, and secondary metabolic pathways in tomato seedlings. The results showed that compared with the control, Cd + Pb stress significantly increased the content of soluble sugar by 37.40% and 33.46% on days 5 and 15, respectively, and the content of proline by 77.91% to 93.91% during the entire period in tomato seedlings.

Copper and lead are among the most widespread metals in everyday life, mainly due to the worldwide expansion of industrialization, and are present in soil, water, and air. Using Allium sativum as a bioindicator for this study, statistical analysis confirmed significant differences in genotoxicity between the two metals, reflected by the inhibition of mitotic activity (MI) or increased indices of cellular abnormalities (AI).

Copper caused a significant reduction in MI, even at relatively low concentrations, with the IC50 observed at 0.50 mM after 72 h of exposure. In contrast, for lead, the IC50 was recorded from 0.75 mM after 72 h exposure. The advantages of the Allium test were demonstrated by its simplicity and high sensitivity in detecting abnormalities.

Description Spermidine fights cancer in aging mice Abundance of the polyamine spermidine decreases in aging mice, and supplementation can have restorative effects and extend life span. Al-Habsi et al. explored whether loss of spermidine might contribute to loss of antitumor immunity in aged mice. Restoration of spermidine concentrations enhanced antitumor responses stimulated by programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) monoclonal antibody therapy. Spermidine appeared to directly affect T cell function by increasing fatty acid oxidation. Tagged spermidine bound to components of the mitochondrial trifunctional protein complex, thus increasing fatty acid oxidation and the production of ATP. The authors propose that these effects may contribute to the effects of spermidine in promoting longevity. \u2014LBR Spermidine helps to restore antitumor immunity in older mice. INTRODUCTION In mammals, the power of the immune system decreases with age. This is because of multiple factors, including a decrease in the output and diversity of the antigenic repertoire of T cells caused by thymus involution; changes in the cellular metabolism caused by inflammation; and defective proliferative, differentiation, or survival capacities of the immune cells. Aged individuals frequently suffer from severe infections and cancers, and often the therapies applied, including programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) blockade in cancer immunotherapy, are ineffective when compared with results in young patients. A biogenic polyamine, spermidine (SPD), decreases with age, and SPD supplementation was shown to improve or delay several age-related pathologies, including those of the immune system. Among the proposed mechanisms responsible for rejuvenation of the immune system by SPD were enhanced autophagy, translational activity, and mitochondrial metabolism. SPD supplementation has previously been shown to enhance the antitumor immunity in animal models. However, it remains largely unknown how SPD deficiency relates to the T cell immune suppression induced by aging. RATIONALE Because CD8+ T cells are key players in tumor immunity, we investigated how aging would affect the metabolic and functional characteristics of CD8+ T cells. We asked whether SPD insufficiency could be a factor contributing to nonresponsiveness to PD-1 antibody therapy in aged mice. We sought to characterize the CD8+ T cell population changes induced by SPD supplementation in aged mice and to identify the molecular mechanisms for the SPD action. RESULTS We found that the total and free intracellular concentrations of SPD in CD8+ T cells from aged mice were about half as much as the concentrations found in young mice. Bioenergetically, aged CD8+ T cells showed impaired mitochondrial activity with lower oxygen consumption rate, adenosine 5\u2032-triphosphate (ATP) production, and fatty acid oxidation (FAO) activity compared with young CD8+ T cells. We show that SPD supplementation enhanced the antitumor activity of PD-1 blockade immunotherapy in aged mice. SPD supplementation proved to also be effective in young mice with tumors unresponsive to single anti\u2013programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibody therapy. SPD and anti\u2013PD-L1 antibody combination treatment enhanced the proliferation, cytokine production, and mitochondrial ATP production of CD8+ T cells in vivo. In vitro, SPD effectively enhanced mitochondrial functions and metabolized palmitate into tricarboxylic acid cycle components within 1 hour, which suggests the possibility of direct SPD binding to mitochondria-related proteins. Biochemical analysis identified SPD binding to mitochondrial trifunctional protein (MTP), which is the central enzyme of fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation. MTP is composed of \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits, both of which bind SPD. Several assays using the MTP synthesized and purified from Escherichia coli revealed that SPD bound with strong affinity [binding affinity (dissociation constant, Kd) = 0.1 \u03bcM] and allosterically enhanced their enzymatic FAO activities. Furthermore, we found that spermine, another polyamine derived from SPD with important cellular protective functions, also directly binds to MTP and competitively inhibits FAO activity of SPD, which suggests the importance of SPD and spermine balance for FAO evaluation in aged cells. T cell\u2013specific deletion of the MTP \u03b1 subunit abolished enhancement of PD-1 blockade immunotherapy by SPD, indicating that MTP is required for SPD-dependent T cell activation. CONCLUSION SPD enhances FAO by directly binding and activating the MTP. SPD supplementation enhances the FAO activity and boosts the mitochondrial activities and cytotoxic functions of CD8+ T cells. We provide new insights into the properties of SPD that may facilitate the development of strategies to prevent and improve outcomes of age-related immune pathologies and combat unresponsiveness to PD-1 blockade therapy in cancers, regardless of age. SPD binds to MTP and activates FAO in T cells. SPD directly activates MTP, which plays a central role in FAO. SPD concentration is decreased in aged T cells, leading to low FAO activity and ATP production compared with those in young T cells. SPD supplementation activates FAO in aged and young T cells, which enhances the efficacy of PD-1 blockade cancer immunotherapy.

Spermidine is an important member of the polyamines family and is involved in a range of abiotic stress responses in plants. Mitochondria play an essential role in cellular homeostasis and are key components of the stress response. Our results indicated that mitochondrial respiratory intensity increased by 80% in wild-type (WT) under heat stress, but the activities of key enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and electron transport chain (ETC) were significantly reduced upon the knockdown of the spermidine synthase gene (spdS). Furthermore, the content of mitochondrial pyruvate decreased by 36.1%, whereas the levels of free fatty acid increased by 28.8% under heat stress. Upon spdS knockdown, the content of mitochondrial pyruvate was similar to that in the WT, but the medium-chain fatty acid (C6:0) decreased by 68.6%-84.2%, whereas the long-chain fatty acid (C18:2) marginally increased. Subsequent studies demonstrated that spermidine promoted the translation of long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCAD) and mitochondrial trifunctional protein (MTP, also known as HADH), thereby enhancing fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation under heat stress. In conclusion, spermidine enhances key TCA cycle and ETC enzyme activities and is involved in heat stress-induced fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation by promoting the translation of LCAD and HADH, thereby improving the heat tolerance of Ganoderma lucidum.\n\n\nIMPORTANCE\nPolyamines are stress-responsive molecules that enhance the tolerance of plants to multiple abiotic stresses by regulating a variety of biological processes.

However, the potential of yeast to augment the growth-promoting and disease-suppressing effects of PGPB on tobacco remains unclear. Methods This study investigated the effects of Pichia sp. microbial fertilizer (J1), PGPB-Klebsiella oxytoca microbial fertilizer (ZS4), and their composite fertilizer (JZ) on tobacco growth indexes, soil properties, and soil microbial community through a pot experiment. Additionally, field experiments were conducted to further assess the efficacy of the composite microbial fertilizer on tobacco growth and the incidences of soil-borne diseases, including tobacco bacterial wilt (TBW) and tobacco black shank (TBS). Results and discussions In the pot experiment, application of the microbial fertilizers significantly enhanced soil organic matter (OM), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total potassium (TK), available phosphorus (AP), and available potassium (AK) levels. Compared to the control group (CK), J1, ZS4, and JZ microbial fertilizers significantly promoted tobacco growth, and the composite microbial fertilizers demonstrated superior to the individual microbial fertilizers. We found that the application of microbial fertilizer led to significant alterations in the structure and composition of the bacterial and fungal communities based on the high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions. The bacterial and fungal diversity indexes showed a decreasing trend. Key microorganisms such as Sphingomonas, Kitasatospora, Nitrosospira, Mortierella, and Trichoderma were identified as influential in regulating soil physicochemical parameters to enhance tobacco growth.

Alternatively, priming can stimulate defence responses to RWA infestation. This study investigated the priming potential of two priming agents, avirulent Puccinia triticina (Pt) isolates and salicylic acid (SA), against RWA infestation. The priming effect of Pt isolates and SA in reducing RWA-induced leaf damage and increased antioxidant activities is an indication of defence responses. Selected South African wheat cultivars and Lesotho landraces, grown under greenhouse conditions, were inoculated with Pt isolates (UVPt13: avirulent, UVPt26: virulent) and treated with SA at the seedling or booting stages. The leaf damage rating score was used for phenotyping. The antioxidant-mediated defence responses were evaluated in three selected cultivars for further priming investigation. Our results revealed that the priming agents significantly reduced the leaf damage in most cultivars at both growth stages, and UVPt13 and SA priming significantly (p \u2264 0.05) increased superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and ascorbate peroxidase activities. However, catalase activity exhibited a more pronounced decline in plants treated with the UVPt13 isolate. The Pt isolate priming was more efficient than the SA application.

Design In this study, we substantiate the causal role of the gut microbiota by use of faecal conditioned media along with faecal microbiota transplantation. Using untargeted and comprehensive approaches, we discovered the mechanism by which the obese microbiota instigates gut permeability, inflammation and abnormalities in glucose metabolism. Results We demonstrated that the reduced capacity of the microbiota from both obese mice and humans to metabolise ethanolamine results in ethanolamine accumulation in the gut, accounting for induction of intestinal permeability. Elevated ethanolamine increased the expression of microRNA-miR-101a-3p by enhancing ARID3a binding on the miR promoter. Increased miR-101a-3p decreased the stability of zona occludens-1 (Zo1) mRNA, which in turn, weakened intestinal barriers and induced gut permeability, inflammation and abnormalities in glucose metabolism. Importantly, restoring ethanolamine-metabolising activity in gut microbiota using a novel probiotic therapy reduced elevated gut permeability, inflammation and abnormalities in glucose metabolism by correcting the ARID3a/miR-101a/Zo1 axis. Conclusion Overall, we discovered that the reduced capacity of obese microbiota to metabolise ethanolamine instigates gut permeability, inflammation and glucose metabolic dysfunctions, and restoring ethanolamine-metabolising capacity by a novel probiotic therapy reverses these abnormalities.

However, the associative relationship between sedentary behavior and these health outcomes remains unclear. This study aims to clarify the association between sedentary lifestyle and psychological and sleep health among adolescents through propensity scores matching analysis. Methods A total of 2,846 adolescents from three universities participated in the study. Data on demographics, exercise habits, eating patterns, sedentary behavior, psychological health, sleep health, self-esteem, and social support were collected. A sedentary lifestyle was defined as sitting for more than six hours daily. Psychological health was assessed using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale for anxiety and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) for depression, while sleep quality was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Self-esteem was evaluated with the Self-Esteem Scale (SES), and social support was measured using the Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS). Propensity scores matching analysis was employed to investigate the associative relationship between sedentary lifestyles and the measured outcomes. Results Prior to propensity scores matching, significant differences were observed in baseline characteristics between participants with and without sedentary lifestyles, including gender (P=0.01), dietary habits (P<0.001), mobile device usage (P<0.001), stress events (P=0.001), physical activity (P<0.001), and chronic diseases (P=0.024). Participants with sedentary lifestyles exhibited higher scores on the GAD-7 (P<0.001), PHQ-9 (P<0.001), and PSQI (P<0.001), along with lower self-esteem (SES, P=0.041) and social support (SSRS, P<0.001) compared to their more active counterparts. Following propensity scores matching, no significant differences in baseline characteristics were found between the two groups (All P>0.282), indicating a successful matching process. Post-matching analysis revealed that individuals with sedentary lifestyles had significantly higher GAD-7 (P=0.002), PHQ-9 (P=0.013), and PSQI scores (P=0.001) than those without sedentary lifestyles, while no significant differences were found in SES (P=0.755) and SSRS (P=0.676).

Modern research has confirmed that the active components of AM, including Astragalus polysaccharides, flavonoids (formononetin and calycosin), Astragalus saponins (Astragaloside I and Astragaloside III), and Astragalus nanovesicles, are effective in the treatment of colorectal cancer. The mechanisms mainly involve inducing apoptosis, inhibiting tumor angiogenesis and the metastasis of cancer cells, regulating the cell cycle and tumor microenvironment, and reversing drug resistance. Moreover, it offers a synergistic enhancement when used in combination with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy, or surgical treatment. AM also has great potential in treating colorectal cancer when combined with other herbs.

Methods The expression and mutational characteristics of four DRGs were first analyzed in bulk RNA-Seq and single-cell RNA sequencing data, IHC staining identified the role of DRGs in BLCA progression, and two DRG clusters were identified by consensus clustering. Using the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from these two clusters, we transformed ten machine learning algorithms into more than 80 combinations and finally selected the best algorithm to construct a disulfidptosis-related prognostic signature (DRPS). We based this selection on the mean C-index of three BLCA cohorts. Furthermore, we explored the differences in clinical characteristics, mutational landscape, immune cell infiltration, and predicted efficacy of immunotherapy between high and low-risk groups.

Notwithstanding progress in therapy, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), the prognosis for individuals with metastatic ccRCC remains poor, presumably owing to metabolic alterations leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, which affects treatment response variability. Methods We analyzed histological and immunohistochemical data from a cohort at Dalian Medical University\u2019s First Affiliated Hospital alongside RNA-sequencing transcriptome data from the TCGA database. Histologically, eosinophilic and clear ccRCC subtypes were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards models for survival analysis and prognosis. Differential gene expression (DEG) analysis and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis were performed to explore transcriptomic differences and relevant pathways. Results The study discovered substantial histological and molecular differences between the eosinophilic and clear cell subtypes of ccRCC. The eosinophilic subtype linked with frequent high-grade tumors (69.05% eosinophil vs 35.35% clear) and a poorer prognosis (HR=2.659, 95% CI:1.437\u20134.919, P=0.002). DEG analysis revealed distinct expression patterns among subtypes and identified a risk score signature that remained significant even after adjusting for clinical variables (HR=3.967, 95% CI: 1.665\u20139.449, P=0.002), showing less favorable survival in the high-risk group (P < 0.0001). RRM2 emerged as the most prognostic gene from this risk score, particularly in the eosinophilic subtype, alongside other clinical variables. By IHC, RRM2 shows high IHC score in eosinophilic compared to clear subtype (P=0.019). In addition, highly expressed RRM2 correlates with poor outcomes and is linked to mitochondrial genes, immunological pathways, and ICIs treatment.

Lychee seeds are considered promising ingredients for developing functional foods owing to their nutraceutical properties and phytochemical composition. This study aimed to induce obesity in zebrafish (Danio rerio) through a hyperlipidic diet supplemented with different concentrations of lychee seed flour and to evaluate its effects on adipose tissue, biochemical parameters, oxidative stress, and caudal fin regeneration.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA total of 200 adult zebrafish were u anded and divided into five experimental groups: control, hyperlipidic diet (HFD), and HFD supplemented with 2%, 4%, and 6% lychee seed flour. After 12 wk of feeding, biochemical parameters (glycemia, triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein-HDL, aspartate aminotransferase-AST, alanine aminotransferase-ALT, and cortisol) and oxidative stress biomarkers, such as Catalase (CAT), Superoxide Dismutase (SOD), Glutathione-S-Transferase (GST), Glutathione (GSH), and Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), were evaluated.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe results showed that the HFD4% group exhibited a significant reduction in the diameter of visceral adipocytes compared with the control, HFD, and HFD2% groups. There was a higher prevalence of severe steatosis in the control and HFD groups and mild steatosis in the HFD6% group. The HFD4% and HFD6% groups had the lowest glycemic levels, whereas the HFD6% group had the highest HDL levels.

Mitochondrial dysfunction as well as disruptions of cellular bioenergetics have been shown to be ubiquitous in some of the most prevalent diseases in our society, such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, cancer, and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. However, the etiology and pathogenesis of mitochondrial dysfunction in multiple diseases have yet to be elucidated, making it one of the most significant medical challenges in our history. However, the rapid advances in our knowledge of cellular metabolism coupled with the novel understanding at the molecular and genetic levels show tremendous promise to one day elucidate the mysteries of this ancient organelle in order to treat it therapeutically when needed. Mitochondrial DNA mutations, infections, aging, and a lack of physical activity have been identified to be major players in mitochondrial dysfunction in multiple diseases. This review examines the complexities of mitochondrial function, whose ancient incorporation into eukaryotic cells for energy purposes was key for the survival and creation of new species. Among these complexities, the tightly intertwined bioenergetics derived from the combustion of alimentary substrates and oxygen are necessary for cellular homeostasis, including the production of reactive oxygen species. This review discusses different etiological mechanisms by which mitochondria could become dysregulated, determining the fate of multiple tissues and organs and being a protagonist in the pathogenesis of many non\u2013communicable diseases. Finally, physical activity is a canonical evolutionary characteristic of humans that remains embedded in our genes. The normalization of a lack of physical activity in our modern society has led to the perception that exercise is an \u201cintervention\u201d. However, physical activity remains the modus vivendi engrained in our genes and being sedentary has been the real intervention and collateral effect of modern societies. It is well known that a lack of physical activity leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and, hence, it probably becomes a major etiological factor of many non\u2013communicable diseases affecting modern societies. Since physical activity remains the only stimulus we know that can improve and maintain mitochondrial function, a significant emphasis on exercise promotion should be imperative in order to prevent multiple diseases. Finally, in populations with chronic diseases where mitochondrial dysfunction is involved, an individualized exercise prescription should be crucial for the \u201cmetabolic rehabilitation\u201d of many patients.

Hence, we explore the protective effect of esculin (Esc), a coumarin glucoside on F--induced oxidative stress and cardiotoxicity in zebrafish larvae.

Glutathione S-transferase mu 2 (GSTM2), a phase II detoxification enzyme, regulates cellular antioxidant and detoxification processes in nonruminants. However, its involvement in NEFA-induced hepatic inflammation in dairy cows with fatty liver remains unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the role of GSTM2 in mediating hepatic inflammation caused by elevated NEFA levels in dairy cows with severe fatty liver. An in vivo study was conducted using 10 healthy cows (hepatic triglyceride [TG] content <1%) and 10 cows with severe fatty liver (hepatic TG content >10%), matched for the number of lactations (median = 3, range = 2-4) and DIM (median = 9 d, range = 3-15 d). Liver tissue and blood samples were collected before feeding. Compared with healthy cows, cows with severe fatty liver had higher plasma concentrations of NEFA, BHB, haptoglobin (HP), plasma amyloid A (SAA), and lower plasma concentration of glucose. These cows also showed significantly lower abundance of hepatic GSTM2 and overactivated hepatic inflammatory pathways, as indicated by increased abundance of phosphorylated inhibitor of \u03baB (I\u03baB)\u03b1 and nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) p65, NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing CARD (ASC), and caspase-1 (CASP1), as well as mRNA levels of tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNFA), IL6, and IL1B. In vitro, hepatocytes isolated from 5 healthy calves (1 d old, fasted female, 30-40 kg of BW) were used to determine the effects of GSTM2 on hepatic inflammation. First, hepatocytes were treated with NEFA (1.2 mM) for varying durations (0.5, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, or 18 h). The NEFA treatment significantly increased the phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1 and NF-\u03baB p65, protein abundance of NLRP3, ASC and CASP1, and mRNA levels of TNFA, IL6 and IL1B, peaking at 9 and 12 h. Second, hepatocytes were treated with different concentrations of NEFA (0, 0.6, 1.2, or 2.4 mM) for 9 h, which decreased GSTM2 protein and mRNA abundance. Meanwhile, GSTM2 was silenced using small interfering RNA or overexpressed using adenovirus for 48 h in hepatocytes, followed by NEFA treatment. Silencing GSTM2 augmented the NEFA-induced increase in phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1 and NF-\u03baB p65, as well as protein abundance of NLRP3, ASC and CASP1, and mRNA levels of TNFA, IL6 and IL1B.

In this study, we employed temporal quantitative proteomics and phosphoproteomics, complemented by computational clustering, PTM-SEA analysis, and kinase activity prediction, to monitor the response of MFM223 triple negative breast cancer cells to FGFR2 inhibition. Strikingly, we observed a marked enrichment of ribosome biogenesis function modules immediately following treatment, a phenomenon not observed with other inhibitors.

While variational autoencoders (VAEs) have shown promise in modeling perturbation responses, their limited explainability poses a significant challenge, as the learned features often lack clear biological meaning.

One of the most effective ways to achieve explainability is incorporating the concept of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) in designing deep learning models such as VAEs. GRNs elicit the underlying causal relationships between genes and are capable of explaining the transcriptional responses caused by genetic perturbation treatments. Results: We propose GPO-VAE, an explainable VAE enhanced by GRN-aligned Parameter Optimization that explicitly models gene regulatory networks in the latent space.

The test looks at patterns in blood samples to detect a cancer signal. NHS-Galleri has enrolled over 140,000 people, invited from the general population of England aged 50\u201377 years who did not have or were not being investigated for cancer. Blood is being collected up to three times: first when people join the study and again 12 and 24 months later. Half the participants (chosen at random) will have their blood tested and half will have their blood stored. Participants will not be told whether their blood will be tested or stored. Participants with a cancer signal detected result will be sent for further diagnostic testing in the NHS. The trial will help the NHS decide whether to introduce screening using this test. Abstract We report the design of the NHS-Galleri trial (ISRCTN91431511), aiming to establish whether a multi-cancer early detection (MCED) test that screens asymptomatic individuals for cancer can reduce late-stage cancer incidence. This randomised controlled trial has invited approximately 1.5 million persons and enrolled over 140,000 from the general population of England (50\u201377 years; \u22653 years without cancer diagnosis or treatment; not undergoing investigation for suspected cancer). Blood is being collected at up to three annual visits. Following baseline blood collection, participants are randomised 1:1 to the intervention (blood tested by MCED test) or control (blood stored) arm. Only participants in the intervention arm with a cancer signal detected have results returned and are referred for urgent investigations and potential treatment. Remaining participants in both arms stay blinded and return for their next visit.

To maximise the use of limited diagnostic resources and increase efficiency, the colorectal services at University Hospitals North Midlands Trust (UHNM) developed the triage-to-test (TTT) service with risk stratification for diagnostic testing in patients with suspected colorectal cancer using faecal immunochemical testing (FIT) result. Our retrospective cohort study looked at the pick-up rate of colorectal cancer (CRC) and non-colorectal cancer (non-CRC) in FIT-negative patients. Methods: The study was a retrospective review of all symptomatic patients over 18 years of age who had undergone FIT testing in the community between 1 November 2021 and 11 February 2022 and who were referred directly to the UHNM colorectal pathway from primary care (n=2,374). FIT negativity was set at <9.9 \u03bcg/g of faeces, as per the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) DG30 guidelines. Patients were investigated and risk stratified in accordance with their FIT result and presenting symptoms. Results: About 61.5% of patients referred were FIT negative (n=1,459) and 38.5% were FIT positive (n=915). Of those FIT-negative patients, 82 were excluded as their clinical outcomes were pending at the time of analysis. FIT positivity conferred a greater likelihood of colorectal cancer when compared with FIT-negative patients (p<0.0001). FIT-negative patients were most likely to have no significant pathology (32.5%, n=474). Incidence of colorectal cancer in the FIT-negative group was 0.5% (n=7) compared with 9.8% (n=89) in the FIT-positive group (odds ratio: 5.252, 95% CI: 4.012-6.875). Within the FIT-negative cohort, five patients were diagnosed with rectal cancer, one proximal descending colon cancer and one caecal cancer. Conclusion : The use of a FIT-negative TTT pathway ensures that any symptomatic patients presenting with red flag symptoms can be investigated appropriately. It also provides reassurance to clinicians who have an ethical duty to investigate patients in whom they suspect sinister pathology. Moreover, a triage-to-Test pathway reduces outpatient capacity burden on healthcare trusts as they may send patients directly for investigation.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2024-11-01", "synthetic_support_claim": "The triage-to-test (TTT) pathway significantly reduces outpatient capacity burden in colorectal cancer diagnostics.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "\"FIT-negative result conclusively rules out colorectal cancer in symptomatic patients.\""}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "b55541734c168c8bfdb1559ffcc6a1de8444119b", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b55541734c168c8bfdb1559ffcc6a1de8444119b", "title": "NHS-Galleri trial: Enriched enrolment approaches and sociodemographic characteristics of enrolled participants.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIMS\nCertain sociodemographic groups are routinely underrepresented in clinical trials, limiting generalisability. Here, we describe the extent to which enriched enrolment approaches yielded a diverse trial population enriched for older age in a randomised controlled trial of a blood-based multi-cancer early detection test (NCT05611632).\n\n\nMETHODS\nParticipants aged 50-77 years were recruited from eight Cancer Alliance regions in England. Most were identified and invited from centralised health service lists; a dynamic invitation algorithm was used to target those in older and more deprived groups. Others were invited by their general practice surgery (GP-based Participant Identification Centres in selected regions); towards the end of recruitment, specifically Asian and Black individuals were invited via this route, as part of a concerted effort to encourage enrolment among these individuals. Some participants self-referred, often following engagement activities involving community organisations. Enrolment took place in 11 mobile clinics at 151 locations that were generally more socioeconomically deprived and ethnically diverse than the England average. We reduced logistical barriers to trial participation by offering language interpretation and translation and disabled access measures. After enrolment, we examined (1) sociodemographic distribution of participants versus England and Cancer Alliance populations, and (2) number needed to invite (NNI; the number of invitations sent to enrol one participant) by age, sex, index of multiple deprivation (IMD) and ethnicity, and GP surgery-level bowel screening participation.\n\n\nRESULTS\nApproximately 1.5 million individuals were invited and 142,924 enrolled (98% via centralised health service lists/invitation algorithm) in 10.5 months. The enrolled population was older and more deprived than the England population aged 50-77 years (73.3% vs 56.8% aged 60-77 years; 42.3% vs 35.3% in IMD groups 1-2). Ethnic diversity was lower in the trial than the England population (1.4% vs 2.8% Black; 3.3% vs 5.3% Asian). NNI was highest in Black (32.8), Asian (28.2) and most-deprived (21.5) groups, and lowest in mixed ethnicity (8.1) and least-deprived (4.6) groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nEnrolment approaches used in the NHS-Galleri trial enabled recruitment of an older, socioeconomically diverse participant population relatively rapidly. Compared with the England and Cancer Alliance populations, the enrolled population was enriched for those in older age and more deprived groups. Better ethnicity data availability in central health service records could enable better invitation targeting to further enhance ethnically diverse recruitment.

Accordingly, a series of plant-derived bioactive compounds are in the clinical development phase against cancer. The present review highlights the significance of several medicinal plants, plant extracts, and their bioactive compounds for their potential anticancer activities. The presented results can be useful for researchers in developing novel anticancer drugs, public health specialists, and for the public in general. Abstract Cancer is one of the major deadly diseases globally. The alarming rise in the mortality rate due to this disease attracks attention towards discovering potent anticancer agents to overcome its mortality rate. The discovery of novel and effective anticancer agents from natural sources has been the main point of interest in pharmaceutical research because of attractive natural therapeutic agents with an immense chemical diversity in species of animals, plants, and microorganisms. More than 60% of contemporary anticancer drugs, in one form or another, have originated from natural sources. Plants and microbial species are chosen based on their composition, ecology, phytochemical, and ethnopharmacological properties. Plants and their derivatives have played a significant role in producing effective anticancer agents. Some plant derivatives include vincristine, vinblastine, irinotecan, topotecan, etoposide, podophyllotoxin, and paclitaxel. Based on their particular activity, a number of other plant-derived bioactive compounds are in the clinical development phase against cancer, such as gimatecan, elomotecan, etc. Additionally, the conjugation of natural compounds with anti-cancerous drugs, or some polymeric carriers particularly targeted to epitopes on the site of interest to tumors, can generate effective targeted treatment therapies.

Despite advancements in cancer therapeutics, effective treatments with minimal side effects remain elusive. Natural sources, such as camel milk, harbor bioactive compounds such as lactoferrin peptides, which hold promise as anticancer agents. This study investigated the potential of camel milk-derived lactoferrin peptides against breast cancer cells through a combined in silico and in vitro approach. By integrating computational modeling with experimental assays, we aimed to elucidate the anticancer mechanisms of these peptides and provide insights for their optimization as anticancer therapeutics. Methods In silico analysis involving pepetid design, and validation, then molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations was used to explore peptide-protein interactions and stability. Peptides were synthesized and tested for anticancer activity using MTT assays on MCF-7 cells, with HDFa normal cells used as controls. Results Results of this study showed that camel milk-derived lactoferrin peptides, particularly PEP66, exhibited strong anticancer activity against MCF-7 breast cancer cells, with the lowest IC50 value (52.82 \u03bcg/mL) compared to other peptides. In silico molecular docking and dynamics simulations revealed that PEP66 formed stable interactions with key residues in the HER2 catalytic site, indicating its potential as an effective anticancer agent. The selectivity index (SI) of PEP66 (3.19) also suggested lower toxicity to normal cells compared to cancer cells, reinforcing its therapeutic potential. Hydrogen bonding analysis highlighted key residues involved in stabilizing peptide-protein complexes, while molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated the stability of these interactions over time. Notably, PEP66 exhibited the highest stability and formed significant interactions with essential residues in the HER2 catalytic site, suggesting its potential as an effective anticancer agent. Conclusion Camel milk-derived lactoferrin peptides show promise as anticancer agents against breast cancer cells. The multidisciplinary approach employed in this study provides valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying their activity, paving the way for rational design strategies to enhance their efficacy.

These plants demonstrate a wide range of anticancer properties, including the ability to induce apoptosis (cell death), halt the cell cycle, inhibit angiogenesis, and regulate inflammatory responses. They contain a variety of phytochemicals, such as flavonoids, tannins, terpenoids, alkaloids, and organosulfur compounds, which contribute to their anticancer effects. For example, Spondias mombin contains flavonoids that inhibit the formation of tumors, whereas Xanthosoma sagittifolium exhibits cytotoxic effects against leukemia cells. Additionally, Elaeis guineensis exhibits antioxidant properties that counteract oxidative stress, a crucial factor in cancer progression.

MYBL2 has been reported to be overexpressed in various tumors and associated with poor prognosis in patients, but its biological role in ccRCC remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the mRNA and protein expression levels of MYBL2 in ccRCC samples and evaluated the prognostic value of MYBL2 using TCGA dataset. In\u00a0vitro functional assays were performed using CCK-8, EdU, colony formation, cell scratch, and transwell assays, as well as in\u00a0vivo tumorigenesis assays to investigate the biological functions of MYBL2 in ccRCC. Additionally, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to explore the downstream pathways of MYBL2, which were further validated. Finally, we predicted the target genes of MYBL2 using bioinformatics and validated them using ChIP and dual-luciferase reporter gene assays. MYBL2 expression was significantly higher in ccRCC than in adjacent normal tissues and was associated with poor prognosis. MYBL2 expression was positively correlated with the pathological tumor grade and clinical TNM stage of ccRCC patients. Knockdown of MYBL2 significantly inhibited the proliferation of renal cancer cells in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo, and knockdown of MYBL2 could inhibit cell invasion and migration, while overexpression of MYBL2 had the opposite effect. GSEA revealed that MYBL2 was associated with the mTOR signaling pathway and cell cycle pathway, which was confirmed by our study. Finally, we found that TOP2A was a target gene of MYBL2, and MYBL2 could bind to the TOP2A promoter to regulate its transcriptional activity, promoting the proliferation of clear cell renal cell carcinoma cells. MYBL2 emerges as a highly expressed factor that significantly correlates with adverse patient prognosis in ccRCC. Mechanistically, MYBL2 transcriptionally upregulates TOP2A, thereby modulating the proliferation of ccRCC cells.

Collagen-induced arthritic mice and TNF-\u03b1 transgenic mice were used to evaluate the roles of the gut commensal Parabacteroides distasonis in RA. The effects of P. distasonis-derived microbial metabolites on the differentiation of CD4+ T cells and macrophage polarisation were also investigated. Results The relative abundance of P. distasonis in new-onset patients with RA and patients with RA with history of the disease was downregulated and this decrease was negatively correlated with Disease Activity Score-28 (DAS28).

Regulatory T (Treg) cells inhibit vascular inflammation through the induction of immune tolerance toward LDL-related antigens. However, tolerogenic mechanisms that promote the generation of LDL-specific Treg cells in vivo remain unclear. METHODS: We identified LDL-specific T cells by activation-induced marker expression and analyzed expression profiles and suppressive functions of TCR (T-cell antigen receptor)-transgenic T cells upon repetitive transfer into antigen-transgenic mice via flow cytometry. RESULTS: We investigated the naturally occurring Treg-cell response against human LDL in standard chow diet\u2013fed mice that are transgenic for human ApoB100 (apolipoprotein B100). We found that IL (interleukin)-10 expression in LDL-specific T cells from spleen increases with age, albeit LDL-specific populations do not enlarge in older mice. To investigate the generation of IL-10\u2013producing LDL-specific T cells, we transferred naive CD4+ T cells recognizing human ApoB100 from TCR-transgenic mice into human ApoB100-transgenic mice. Adoptive transfer of human ApoB100-specific T cells induced immune tolerance in recipient mice and effectively inhibited activation of subsequently transferred naive T cells of the same specificity in vivo. Moreover, repetitive transfers increased the population of Treg type 1 cells that suppress ApoB100-specific responses via IL-10. In a translational approach, LDL-specific Treg type 1 cells from blood of healthy donors suppressed the activation of monocytic THP-1 cells in an IL-10\u2013dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: We show that repetitive transfer of naive ApoB100-specific T cells and recurrent LDL-specific T-cell stimulation induces Treg type 1 cell\u2013mediated immune tolerance against LDL in vivo.

Standard CVD treatments primarily focus on mitigating cardiovascular (CV) risk factors through lifestyle changes and cholesterol-lowering therapies. As atherosclerosis is marked by chronic arterial inflammation, the innate and adaptive immune systems play vital roles in its progression, either exacerbating or alleviating disease development. This intricate interplay positions the immune system as a compelling therapeutic target. Consequently, immunomodulatory strategies have gained increasing attention, though none have yet reached widespread clinical adoption. Safety concerns, particularly the suppression of host immune defenses, remain a significant barrier to the clinical application of anti-inflammatory therapies. Recent decades have revealed the significant role of adaptive immune responses to plaque-associated autoantigens in atherogenesis, opening new perspectives for targeted immunological interventions. Preclinical models indicate that vaccines targeting specific atherosclerosis-related autoantigens can slow disease progression while preserving systemic immune function. In this context, numerous experimental studies have advanced the understanding of vaccine development by exploring diverse targeting pathways. Key strategies include passive immunization using naturally occurring immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies and active immunization targeting low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and apolipoproteins, such as apolipoprotein B100 (ApoB100) and apolipoprotein CIII (ApoCIII). Other approaches involve vaccine formulations aimed at proteins that regulate lipoprotein metabolism, including proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), and angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3).

TDP-43 mislocalization results in cryptic splicing and polyadenylation of pre\u2013messenger RNAs (pre-mRNAs) encoding stathmin-2 (also known as SCG10), a protein that is required for axonal regeneration. We found that TDP-43 binding to a GU-rich region sterically blocked recognition of the cryptic 3\u2032 splice site in STMN2 pre-mRNA.

Description Rescue from TDP-43 proteinopathies Loss of the RNA-binding protein TDP-43 from the nuclei of affected neurons is a hallmark of neurodegeneration in TDP-43 proteinopathies, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. The RNA most affected by reduced TDP-43, STMN2, encodes stathmin-2, a protein required for axonal regeneration after injury. Baughn et al. found that TDP-43 sterically blocks recognition of a cryptic splice site in STMN2 pre-mRNA (see the Perspective by O\u2019Brien and Mizielinska). The CRISPR effector dCasRx or antisense oligonucleotides could block STMN2 pre-mRNA cryptic splicing. This approach was able to rescue stathmin-2 levels in TDP-43\u2013deficient human motor neurons and mouse genes edited to contain human STMN2 cryptic splice/polyadenylation sequences. \u2014SMH An antisense oligonucleotide approach shows potential for therapeutic restoration of stathmin-2 in TDP-43 proteinopathies. INTRODUCTION Nuclear clearance and cytoplasmic aggregation of the RNA-binding protein TDP-43 is the hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases called TDP-43 proteinopathies. This includes almost all instances of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and about half of frontotemporal dementia. In ALS, the motor neurons that innervate and trigger contraction of skeletal muscles degenerate, resulting in paralysis. One of the most highly abundant motor neuron mRNAs encodes stathmin-2, a protein necessary for axonal regeneration and maintenance of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). Loss of functional TDP-43 is accompanied by misprocessing of the STMN2 RNA precursor, which is driven by use of cryptic splicing and polyadenylation sites, and producing a truncated RNA that encodes a nonfunctional stathmin-2 fragment. RATIONALE Recognizing that stathmin-2 is essential for axonal recovery after injury and NMJ maintenance, a central interest in TDP-43 proteinopathies is to determine the mechanism through which TDP-43 enables correct processing of STMN2 mRNAs and to develop methods to restore stathmin-2 synthesis in neurons with TDP-43 dysfunction. RESULTS We found that TDP-43 binding to a 24-base, GU-rich motif within the first intron of the STMN2 pre-mRNA was required to suppress cryptic splicing and polyadenylation. Conversion of this GU-rich binding motif into a 19-base sequence bound by the MS2 bacteriophage coat protein (MCP) ablated TDP-43 binding and produced constitutive misprocessing of STMN2. Correct processing of this modified STMN2 pre-mRNA was restored by binding of MCP, suggesting that TDP-43 normally functions by sterically blocking access to the cryptic sites of RNA-processing factors. Further genome editing revealed that the cryptic 3\u2032 splice acceptor, not the cryptic polyadenylation site, was essential for initiating STMN2 pre-mRNA misprocessing. Rescue of stathmin-2 expression and axonal regeneration after injury in human motor neurons depleted of TDP-43 was achieved with steric binding antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs). Humanization (by insertion of the human STMN2 cryptic exon) sensitized mouse Stmn2 to TDP-43 expression level. Mice alternately humanized with the cryptic exon containing a disrupted TDP-43 binding site produced chronic Stmn2 pre-mRNA misprocessing independent of TDP-43 level. ASOs were identified that when injected into cerebral spinal fluid of mice with constitutive humanized Stmn2 RNA misprocessing, restored stathmin-2 mRNA and protein levels. CONCLUSION We determined that TDP-43 binding in the first intron of the STMN2 pre-mRNA sterically blocked access of RNA processing factors that would otherwise recognize and use a cryptic 3\u2032 splice site. We identified RNA-targeted CRISPR effectors and ASOs that restored STMN2 levels despite reduced TDP-43. ASO injection into cerebral spinal fluid, an approach feasible for human therapy, rescued stathmin-2 protein levels in the central nervous system of mice with chronically misprocessed Stmn2 pre-mRNAs. Steric blocking of cryptic splicing rescues stathmin-2 levels in the central nervous system. (A) TDP-43 sterically blocks recognition of a cryptic splice site in STMN2 pre-RNA, enabling correct processing of intron 1, stathmin-2 protein synthesis, and axonal regeneration after injury. (B) Nuclear clearance of TDP-43 in ALS and other TDP-43 proteinopathies results in cryptic splicing within the first STMN2 intron and loss of stathmin-2 protein.

Disordered swallow (dysphagia) is a serious problem in elderly humans, increasing the risk of aspiration, a key contributor to mortality. Despite this importance, very little is known about the pathophysiology of ageing dysphagia and the relative importance of frank muscle weakness compared to timing/activation abnormalities. In elderly humans and in aged Fisher 344 (F344) rats, a variety of motor pools exhibit weakness and atrophy (sarcopenia), contemporaneous to MN death. Synchronisation of swallow is dependent on the stability of MN dendrites, which integrate neural circuits. Dendritic derangement occurs in many neuromotor degenerative conditions prior to MN death. We hypothesise behavioural weakness and death of nucleus ambiguus MNs will occur by age 24\u00a0months in F344 rats and that this will be preceded by swallow-respiration dyscoordination and dendritic arbour degenerations from 18\u00a0months compared to controls at 6\u00a0months. Using pressure catheters to estimate laryngeal and diaphragm function during naturalistic water bolus applications, we show that swallow number and post-swallow apnoeas are altered from 18\u00a0months. Swallow pressure (weakness) and nucleus ambiguus MN numbers (evaluated via stereological assessments of Nissl staining) were reduced at 24\u00a0months. Dendritic lengths, surface areas and dendritic spines were reduced in nucleus ambiguus MNs from 18\u00a0months (evaluated by confocal imaging of Golgi-Cox impregnated brainstem). These results show that synapse loss occurs prior to MN death and behavioural weakness. Strategies to preserve synapses may be of utility in ameliorating sarcopenia. KEY POINTS: Dysphagia is a major contributor to ageing morbidity and mortality, but the underling pathophysiology is unexplored. Here, in Fischer 344 rats, we use pressure and timing evaluations of swallow-respiration, showing timing impairments occur prior to frank pressure defects. In nucleus ambiguus motor neurons, dendritic defects were apparent with the onset of swallow-respiration dyscoordination, with frank motor neuron loss occurring subsequently to synapse loss.

It is therefore not sufficient to evaluate these methods solely by RMSD to a native binding mode. It is vital, particularly for deep learning-based methods, that they are also evaluated on steric and energetic criteria.

Furthermore, these diseases often involve multiple targets, making the redevelopment of traditional medicines highly promising. Accurate prediction of potential snoRNA therapeutic targets is essential for early disease intervention and the redevelopment of traditional medicines. Additionally, researchers have developed artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods to screen and predict potential snoRNA therapeutic targets, thereby advancing traditional drug redevelopment. However, existing methods face challenges such as imbalanced datasets and the dominance of high-degree nodes in graph neural networks (GNNs), which compromise the accuracy of node representations. To address these challenges, we propose an AI model based on variational graph autoencoders (VGAEs) that integrates decoupling and Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) technologies. The model reconstructs snoRNA-disease graphs by learning snoRNA and disease representations, accurately identifying potential snoRNA therapeutic targets. By decoupling similarity from node degree, the model mitigates the dominance of high-degree nodes, enhances prediction accuracy in scenarios like lung cancer, and leverages KAN technology to improve adaptability and flexibility to new data.

And mutation of enzymes in the TCA cycle leads to the unusual accumulation of certain metabolites and oncometabolites. Mitochondria have been demonstrated as the target for cancer treatment. Cancer cells rely on two main energy resources: oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and glycolysis. By manipulating OXPHOS genes or adjusting the metabolites production in mitochondria, tumor growth can be restrained. For example, enhanced complex I activity increases NAD+/NADH to prevent metastasis and progression of cancers.

However, emerging research indicates that the Warburg effect is not just a strategy for cancer cells to proliferate at higher rates compared to normal cells; thus, it should not be considered an 'enemy' since it also plays complex roles in normal cellular functions and/or under stress conditions, prompting a reconsideration of its purely detrimental characterization. Moreover, this review highlights that distinguishing glycolysis as 'aerobic' and 'anaerobic' should not exist, as lactate is likely the final product of glycolysis, regardless of the presence of oxygen. Finally, this review explores the nuanced contributions of the Warburg effect beyond oncology, including its regulatory roles in various cellular environments and the potential effects on systemic physiological processes.

These conditions are often accompanied by chronic inflammation and dysregulated immune responses, which are closely linked to specific forms of cell death, including pyroptosis and ferroptosis. Pathogenic bacteria in the gut can trigger these cell death pathways through toxin release, while probiotics have been found to mitigate these effects by modulating immune responses.

Although these alterations are often transient, many patients with COVID-19 exhibit olfactory dysfunction that lasts months to years. Although animal and human autopsy studies have suggested mechanisms driving acute anosmia, it remains unclear how SARS-CoV-2 causes persistent smell loss in a subset of patients. To address this question, we analyzed olfactory epithelial samples collected from 24 biopsies, including from nine patients with objectively quantified long-term smell loss after COVID-19. This biopsy-based approach revealed a diffuse infiltrate of T cells expressing interferon-\u03b3 and a shift in myeloid cell population composition, including enrichment of CD207+ dendritic cells and depletion of anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages. Despite the absence of detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA or protein, gene expression in the barrier supporting cells of the olfactory epithelium, termed sustentacular cells, appeared to reflect a response to ongoing inflammatory signaling, which was accompanied by a reduction in the number of olfactory sensory neurons relative to olfactory epithelial sustentacular cells.

Transcription factor EB (TFEB) is a major effector of AMPK that increases expression of lysosome genes in response to energetic stress, but how AMPK activates TFEB remains unresolved. We demonstrate that AMPK directly phosphorylates five conserved serine residues in folliculin-interacting protein 1 (FNIP1), suppressing the function of the folliculin (FLCN)\u2013FNIP1 complex. FNIP1 phosphorylation is required for AMPK to induce nuclear translocation of TFEB and TFEB-dependent increases of peroxisome proliferator\u2013activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1\u03b1) and estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERR\u03b1) messenger RNAs. Thus, mitochondrial damage triggers AMPK-FNIP1\u2013dependent nuclear translocation of TFEB, inducing sequential waves of lysosomal and mitochondrial biogenesis. Description Linking AMPK to organelle biogenesis The kinase AMPK is a key sensor that helps to control energy homeostasis. Malik et al. reveal the mechanism by which AMPK controls the transcription factor TFEB to increase gene transcription and to support mitochondrial and lysosomal biogenesis. AMPK appears to act by direct phosphorylation of folliculin-interacting protein 1 (FNIP1). FNIP is part of a complex that acts as a GTP-activating protein for the GTPases RagC and RagD, which regulate the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 protein kinase signaling complex on the lysosomal surface. This results in release of TFEB from the lysosome, allowing it to act at the nucleus. \u2014LBR The energy-sensing protein kinase AMPK also regulates organelle biogenesis. INTRODUCTION Eukaryotes contain a highly conserved signaling pathway that becomes rapidly activated when adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels decrease, as happens during conditions of nutrient shortage or mitochondrial dysfunction. The adenosine monophosphate (AMP)\u2013activated protein kinase (AMPK) is activated within minutes of energetic stress and phosphorylates a limited number of substrates to biochemically rewire metabolism from an anabolic state to a catabolic state to restore metabolic homeostasis. AMPK also promotes prolonged metabolic adaptation through transcriptional changes, decreasing biosynthetic genes while increasing expression of genes promoting lysosomal and mitochondrial biogenesis. The transcription factor EB (TFEB) is a well-appreciated effector of AMPK-dependent signals, but many of the molecular details of how AMPK controls these processes remain unknown. RATIONALE The requirement of AMPK and its specific downstream targets that control aspects of the transcriptional adaptation of metabolism remain largely undefined. We performed time courses examining gene expression changes after various mitochondrial stresses in wild-type (WT) or AMPK knockout cells. We hypothesized that a previously described interacting protein of AMPK, folliculin-interacting protein 1 (FNIP1), may be involved in how AMPK promotes increases in gene expression after metabolic stress. FNIP1 forms a complex with the protein folliculin (FLCN), together acting as a guanosine triphosphate (GTP)\u2013activating protein (GAP) for RagC. The FNIP1-FLCN complex has emerged as an amino acid sensor to the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), involved in how amino acids control TFEB activation. We therefore examined whether AMPK may regulate FNIP1 to dominantly control TFEB independently of amino acids. RESULTS AMPK was found to govern expression of a core set of genes after various mitochondrial stresses. Hallmark features of this response were activation of TFEB and increases in the transcription of genes specifying lysosomal and mitochondrial biogenesis. AMPK directly phosphorylated five conserved serine residues in FNIP1, suppressing the function of the FLCN-FNIP1 GAP complex, which resulted in dissociation of RagC and mTOR from the lysosome, promoting nuclear translocation of TFEB even in the presence of amino acids. FNIP1 phosphorylation was required for AMPK to activate TFEB and for subsequent increases in peroxisome proliferation\u2013activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1\u03b1) and estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERR\u03b1) mRNAs. Cells in which the five serines in FNIP1 were mutated to alanine were unable to increase lysosomal and mitochondrial gene expression programs after treatment with mitochondrial poisons or AMPK activators despite the presence and normal regulation of all other substrates of AMPK. By contrast, neither AMPK nor its control of FNIP1 were needed for activation of TFEB after amino acid withdrawal, illustrating the specificity to energy-limited conditions. CONCLUSION Our data establish FNIP1 as the long-sought substrate of AMPK that controls TFEB translocation to the nucleus, defining AMPK phosphorylation of FNIP1 as a singular event required for increased lysosomal and mitochondrial gene expression programs after metabolic stresses. This study also illuminates the larger biological question of how mitochondrial damage triggers a temporal response of repair and replacement of damaged mitochondria: Within early hours, AMPK-FNIP1\u2013activated TFEB induces a wave of lysosome and autophagy genes to promote degradation of damaged mitochondria, and a few hours later, TFEB\u2013up-regulated PGC1\u237a and ERR\u237a promote expression of a second wave of genes specifying mitochondrial biogenesis. These insights open therapeutic avenues for several common diseases associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, ranging from neurodegeneration to type 2 diabetes to cancer. Mitochondrial damage activates AMPK to phosphorylate FNIP1, stimulating TFEB translocation to the nucleus and sequential waves of lysosomal and mitochondrial biogenesis. After mitochondrial damage, activated AMPK phosphorylates FNIP1 (1), causing inhibition of FLCN-FNIP1 GAP activity (2). This leads to accumulation of RagC in its GTP-bound form, causing dissociation of RagC, mTORC1, and TFEB from the lysosome (3). TFEB is therefore not phosphorylated and translocates to the nucleus, inducing transcription of lysosomal or autophagy genes, with parallel increases in NT-PGC1\u03b1 mRNA (4), which, in concert with ERR\u03b1 (5), subsequently induces mitochondrial biogenesis (6).

Here it is observed that the application of voltage results in noticeable differences to the charge state distributions (CSDs) of ubiquitin ions. The data can be described most generally in three distinct voltage regions: Under low-voltage conditions (<+200 V, LV regime), low charge states (2+ to 4+ ions) dominate the mass spectra. For midvoltage conditions (+200 to +600 V, MV regime), higher charge states (7+ to 12+ ions) are observed. For high-voltage conditions (>+600 V, HV regime), the \u201cnano-electrospray ionization (nESI)-type distribution\u201d is achieved in which the 6+ and 5+ species are observed as the dominant ions. Analysis of these results suggests that different pathways to progeny nanodroplet production result in the observed ions. For the LV regime, aerodynamic breakup leads to low charge progeny droplets that are selective for the native solution conformation ensemble of ubiquitin (minus multimeric species). In the MV regime, the large droplets persist for longer periods of time, leading to droplet heating and a shift in the conformation ensemble to partially unfolded species. In the HV regime, droplets access progeny nanodroplets faster, leading to native conformation ensemble sampling as indicated by the observed nESI-type CSD. The notable observation of limited multimer formation and adduct ion formation in the LV regime is hypothesized to result from droplet aero breakup resulting in protein and charge carrier partitioning in sampled progeny droplets.

After adjustment for age and sex, GrimAge2 outperforms GrimAge in predicting mortality across multiple racial/ethnic groups (meta P=3.6x10-167 versus P=2.6x10-144) and in terms of associations with age related conditions such as coronary heart disease, lung function measurement FEV1 (correlation= -0.31, P=1.1x10-136), computed tomography based measurements of fatty liver disease. We present evidence that GrimAge version 2 also applies to younger individuals and to saliva samples where it tracks markers of metabolic syndrome. DNAm logCRP is positively correlated with morbidity count (P=1.3x10-54). DNAm logA1C is highly associated with type 2 diabetes (P=5.8x10-155). DNAm PAI-1 outperforms the other age-adjusted DNAm biomarkers including GrimAge2 in correlating with triglyceride (cor=0.34, P=9.6x10-267) and visceral fat (cor=0.41, P=4.7x10-41).

To investigate the effects of the combined foliar application of zinc (Zn) and iron (Fe) nanoparticles with the recommended nitrogen dose (RND) on maize production and grain chemical composition under different water regimes, two field experiments were conducted in El-Ayyat city, Giza, Egypt, during the summer seasons of 2022 and 2023. This study utilized a split-split-plot experimental design with three replications. The main plots were designated to different water regimes (100, 80, 60, and 40% of estimated evapotranspiration), while the sub-plots were randomly distributed with Zn and Fe nanoparticle concentrations (0, 100, and 200 mg/L). The sub-sub-plots were randomly allocated to three maize cultivars (SC-P3062, SC-32D99, and SC-P3433). The results revealed that exposure to drought conditions resulted in a significant decline in the yield and yield-related attributes across all maize cultivars examined. Grain yield decreased by 10\u201350% under drought conditions. However, the foliar application of Zn and Fe nanoparticles was found to significantly improve grain yield, protein content, oil content, starch content, crude fiber, ash, and macro- and micronutrient concentrations in the maize cultivars under control and drought stress conditions. The foliar application of Zn and Fe nanoparticles at a concentration of 200 mg/L to the SC-P3433 maize cultivar led to the greatest grain yield per hectare, reaching 11,749 and 11,657 kg under the irrigation regimes with 100 and 80% total evapotranspiration, respectively. According to the assessment using the relative drought index, the SC-P3062 maize cultivar demonstrated tolerance (T) to water stress conditions. In conclusion, the foliar application of Zn and Fe nanoparticles (100\u2013200 mg/L) effectively mitigated the negative effects of drought stress on maize plants.

The treatments significantly influenced enzymatic activities and defense-related gene expression. On Day 6, peroxidase (POD) activity reached its highest value of 0.563 in the SP15 (siderophore + pathogen at 15 \u00b5g/mL) treatment, with S15 (siderophore-only at 15 \u00b5g/mL) showing a lower but significant increase of 0.453, while control groups remained unchanged.

Copper is also necessary for cellular processes, such as the regulation of intracellular signal transduction, catecholamine balance, myelination of neurons, and efficient synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. Copper is naturally present in some foods and is available as a dietary supplement. Only small amounts of copper are typically stored in the body and a large amount of copper is excreted through bile and urine. Given the critical role of copper in a breadth of cellular processes, local concentrations of copper and the cellular distribution of copper transporter proteins in the brain are important to maintain the steady state of the internal environment. The dysfunction of copper metabolism or regulatory pathways results in an imbalance in copper homeostasis in the brain, which can lead to a myriad of acute and chronic pathological effects on neurological function.

Accumulating evidence suggest that synapses are impaired during Wilson\u2019s disease (WD), contributing to neuronal dysfunction and cognitive decline. WD is a prototypical condition among the copper metabolism disorders. Cognitive impairment is a common feature of affected patients with neurological symptoms, presenting as memory deficits, decreased cognitive flexibility, and impaired learning capabilities. These cognitive deficits can significantly impact the quality of life, affecting work and academic performance. However, the mechanisms mediating the inhibitory synaptic dysfunction in WD are incompletely understood. We investigated the effects of the double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase/eukaryotic initiation factor 2\u03b1 (PKR/eIF2\u03b1) pathway on synaptic structure and function in WD using a murine model, toxic milk (TX mice). During mouse open-field tests, we noted a substantial rise in the mobility/immobility ratio among WD model animals compared to that in WT mice. Additionally, WD mice exhibited diminished central area exploration, as evidenced by reduced travel distance. Moreover, they displayed prolonged escape latency in the Barnes maze, suggesting that chronic copper accumulation is associated with neuropsychiatric alterations and cognitive impairment. We also found a decrease in the expression of synapse-associated proteins (synapsin 1, synaptophysin, postsynaptic density protein-93 [PSD93], postsynaptic density protein-95 [PSD95]), and vesicle-associated membrane protein2 [VAMP2]) besides abnormal neurotransmitter levels (including glutamate and GABA), indicating the presence of synaptic dysfunction in TX mice. Inhibiting PKR via C16 prevented these changes, suggesting that dysfunctional cognition is associated with the PKR/eIF2\u03b1 pathway. We also observed changes in synapses, vesicles, dendritic spine density, and dendritic length that were associated with the presence of cognitive dysfunction. Further investigation revealed that C16 treatment decreased the TUNEL-positive cell numbers in the hippocampus of TX mice and prevented 8-OHdG-induced synaptic dysfunction.

Invasive pest species are non-native organisms that humans have either accidentally or intentionally spread to new regions. One of the most effective and first lines of control strategies for controlling pests is the application of insecticides. These toxic chemicals are employed to get rid of pests, but they pose great risks to people, animals, and plants. Pesticides are heavily used in managing invasive pests in the current era. Due to the overuse of synthetic chemicals, numerous invasive species have already developed resistance. The resistance development is the main reason for the failure to manage the invasive species. Developing pesticide resistance management techniques necessitates a thorough understanding of the mechanisms through which insects acquire insecticide resistance. Insects use a variety of behavioral, biochemical, physiological, genetic, and metabolic methods to deal with toxic chemicals, which can lead to resistance through continuous overexpression of detoxifying enzymes. An overabundance of enzymes causes metabolic resistance, detoxifying pesticides and rendering them ineffective against pests. A key factor in the development of metabolic resistance is the amplification of certain metabolic enzymes, specifically esterases, Glutathione S-transferase, Cytochromes p450 monooxygenase, and hydrolyses. Additionally, insect guts offer unique habitats for microbial colonization, and gut bacteria may serve their hosts a variety of useful services. Most importantly, the detoxification of insecticides leads to resistance development. The complete knowledge of invasive pest species and their mechanisms of resistance development could be very helpful in coping with the challenges and effectively developing effective strategies for the control of invasive species.

Pest management is a key issue in the field of agriculture to boost yields and consequently local economy. From a food safety perspective, pest detection and control is certainly significant for producing healthy crops characterized by high-quality, pesticide-free fruits and vegs.

We delved into the transcriptomics of this pressured strain to gain insights into the molecular changes underlying insecticide resistance in Ae. aegypti. Our data suggest mosquito resistance is influenced by additional mechanisms that are difficult to explain using only classical mechanisms. The response by mosquitoes varies depending on the exposure time. Initially, when mosquitoes are in contact with insecticides, they modulate the expression of metabolic enzymes and gain some point mutations in the sodium channel genes. After long-term exposure, the mosquitoes respond to insecticides by expressing different proteins involved in the cuticle, energetic metabolism, and synthesis of proteases.

TYP, with bioavailability of only 2.78%, is an active component of Typha angustifolia L. and Pushen capsules which is clinically treated for hyperlipidemia. The metabolic process of TYP is identified, and key enzymes involved in TYP metabolism are validated through gene knockout and overexpression techniques. Through overexpressing \u03b1-rhamnosidase (Rha) in Escherichia coli, TYP is verified to metabolize into isorhamnetin-3-O-neohesperidin (M1) and isorhamnetin-3-O-glucoside (M2) after removing rhamnose through Rha. Besides, knockout of \u03b2-glucosidase (Glu) confirms that TYP generates M3 through Glu after removing glucose. Combined with molecular docking, M3 is transformed to generate 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (M4), protocatechuic acid (M5), and 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (M6) through flavonoid reductase (Flr) and chalcone isomerase (Chi). In conclusion, multiple enzymes involved in TYP metabolism (Rha/Glu\u2192Flr\u2192Chi) are identified.

The toxicokinetics and dynamics of Cd reveal its propensity for long biological retention and predominant storage in soft tissues. Until the 1950s, Cd pollution was caused by industrial activities, whereas nowadays, the main source is phosphate fertilizers, which strongly contaminate soil and water and affect human health and ecosystems. Cd enters the human body mainly through ingestion and inhalation, with food and tobacco smoke being the primary sources.

Besides growth reduction, the chlorophyll a and carotenoid contents as well as the chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters, namely, the maximum photochemical efficiency of PS II and non-photochemical quenching, were significantly decreased in the Ni-treated cucumber plants. Application of Ni resulted in changes in the phenolic acid and flavonoid profiles; however, the total content of the detected phenolic compounds remained unchanged in the leaf and slightly decreased in the root. The Ni-induced release of free phenolic acids from their conjugates was found in the leaf.

Studies have suggested that the risk allele of the zinc transporter 8 gene (SLC30A8) single-nucleotide poly-morphism (SNP) rs13266634 may contribute to T2DM susceptibility in addition to the complex protein interactions and alterations in the protein expressions and modifications associated with T2DM. This study was implemented to study the associations between SLC30A8 polymorphism, serum zinc levels, and the profiles of proteins differentially expressed in nondiabetic (n = 116) and prediabetic/diabetic (n = 149) subjects. Methods: SNP genotyping using TaqMan\u00ae assay and proteomic analysis by LC-MS/MS were performed in each group. Results: The results showed a higher risk of diabetes in individuals with the risk genotype CC accompanied by a low serum zinc level than in those with other genotypes. Profiles of proteins differentially expressed between the groups were identified and shown to be particularly associated with zinc-related functions, zinc transporter 8, and glucose metabolism. Proteins exclusively expressed in prediabetes/diabetes were assigned to a Reactome pathway related to zinc transporter and insulin processing. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that individuals carrying at least one copy of SLC30A8 rs13266634 accompanied by a low serum zinc level might be susceptible to T2DM, which could be due to alterations in insulin signaling and zinc metabolism.

While most individuals recover naturally, some develop long COVID (LC) syndrome, marked by persistent or new symptoms weeks to months after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Despite its prevalence, there are no clinical tests to distinguish LC patients from those fully recovered. Understanding the immunological basis of LC is essential for improving diagnostic and treatment approaches. Methods We performed deep immunophenotyping and functional assays to examine the immunological profiles of LC patients, individuals with active COVID-19, recovered patients, and healthy donors. This analysis assessed both innate and adaptive immune features, identifying potential biomarkers for LC syndrome. A Binomial Generalized Linear Model (BGLM) was used to pinpoint immune features characterizing LC. Results COVID-19 patients exhibited depletion of innate immune cell subsets, including plasmacytoid and conventional dendritic cells, classical, non-classical, and intermediate monocytes, and monocyte-derived inflammatory dendritic cells. Elevated basal inflammation was observed in COVID-19 patients compared to LC patients, whose immune profiles were closer to those of healthy donors and recovered individuals. However, LC patients displayed persistent immune alterations, including reduced T cell subsets (CD4, CD8, Tregs) and switched memory B cells, similar to COVID-19 patients. Through BGLM, a unique adaptive immune signature for LC was identified, featuring memory CD8 and gd T cells with low proliferative capacity and diminished expression of activation and homing receptors. Discussion The findings highlight a unique immunological signature associated with LC syndrome, characterized by persistent adaptive immune dysregulation.

T-cell depletion (TEX) is a progressive decline in T-cell function due to continuous stimulation of the TCR in the presence of sustained antigen exposure. Numerous studies have shown that TEX plays an essential role in the antitumor immune process and is significantly associated with patient prognosis. Hence, it is important to gain insight into the potential role of T cell depletion in the tumor microenvironment. The purpose of this study was to develop a trustworthy TEX-based signature using single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) and high-throughput RNA sequencing, opening up new avenues for evaluating the prognosis and immunotherapeutic response of HCC patients. Methods The International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases were used to download RNA-seq information for HCC patients. The 10x scRNA-seq. data of HCC were downloaded from GSE166635, and UMAP was used for clustering descending, and subgroup identification.

Finally, the differential expression of TEX genes was verified by qRT-PCR. Result 11 TEX genes were thought to be highly predictive of the prognosis of HCC and substantially related to HCC prognosis. Patients in the low-risk group had a greater overall survival rate than those in the high-risk group, according to multivariate analysis, which also revealed that the model was an independent predictor of HCC.

This technical mismatch together with complexity of EV\u2010containing fluids causes limitations and challenges with conducting, interpreting and reproducing EV FCM experiments. To address and overcome these challenges, researchers from the International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV), International Society for Advancement of Cytometry (ISAC), and the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) joined forces and initiated the EV FCM working group.

Therefore, the goal of this compendium is to provide the background information necessary to design and conduct reproducible EV FCM experiments.

Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) are essential mediators of cellular crosstalk; however, their role in the development of postinjury ALI remains unclear. We hypothesized that LC complicated by pneumonia increases the pro-inflammatory effect of alveolar sEVs on macrophages and the cytotoxicity of alveolar sEVs to pulmonary epithelial cells, worsening the severity of ALI.\n\n\nMETHODS\nStudies in C57BL/6 mice were designed with four groups: sham, LC, Pneumonia (Pneu), and LC + Pneu. Lung contusion was induced by a cortical controlled impactor, while pneumonia was conducted by intratracheal injection of 105 cfu Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) was harvested 24 hours postinfection, and sEVs were purified by centrifugation and size exclusion chromatography. To evaluate the effect of alveolar sEV on cells, sEVs from each group were cocultured with macrophages (RAW 264.7) to assess cytokine release and lung epithelial cells (MLE 12) to assess epithelial cytotoxicity.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe LC + Pneu group severely injured lungs histologically and increased the susceptibility to the bacteria. The LC + Pneu group showed higher concentrations of proteins, macrophage inflammatory protein 1-alpha (MIP1\u03b1), and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) in BAL. MIP1\u03b1 and ICAM-1 expression in the macrophages increased after incubation with sEVs from the LC + Pneu group. Moreover, the sEVs demonstrated higher cytotoxicity to epithelial cells and increased apoptosis in epithelial cells after incubation with sEVs from the LC + Pneu group.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nLung contusion complicated by pneumonia increased the pro-inflammatory effect of alveolar sEVs on macrophages and the cytotoxicity of alveolar sEVs to pulmonary epithelial cells, worsening the severity of ALI.

The gut microbiota, which vastly outnumbers human cells and has a genetic potential that exceeds that of the human genome, plays a crucial role in this interplay. The microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis is a bidirectional signalling pathway that operates through neural, endocrine, immune, and metabolic pathways. One of the major neuroendocrine systems responding to stress is the HPA axis which produces glucocorticoids such as cortisol in humans and corticosterone in rodents. Appropriate concentrations of cortisol are essential for normal neurodevelopment and function, as well as cognitive processes such as learning and memory, and studies have shown that microbes modulate the HPA axis throughout life. Stress can significantly impact the MGB axis via the HPA axis and other pathways. Animal research has advanced our understanding of these mechanisms and pathways, leading to a paradigm shift in conceptual thinking about the influence of the microbiota on human health and disease.

The present results indicated that TCP3 (PKK), TCP6 (YEGGD) and TCP9 (GPGLM) had significant cytoprotective effect on UVB-irradiated HaCaT cells (p < 0.001). Hoechst 33342 staining showed that apoptosis of UV-irradiated HaCaT cells could be significantly reduced by the treatment of TCP3 (PKK), TCP6 (YEGGD) and TCP9 (GPGLM); JC-1 staining showed that TCP3 (PKK), TCP6 (YEGGD) and TCP9 (GPGLM) could protect HaCaT cells from apoptosis by restoring mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP); Furthermore, TCP3 (PKK), TCP6 (YEGGD) and TCP9 (GPGLM) could significantly down-regulate the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 and reduce the expression level of the apoptosis-executing protein Caspase-3 by decreasing the expression of protein Caspase-8 and Caspase-9 (p < 0.05). The action mechanism indicated that TCP3 (PKK), TCP6 (YEGGD) and TCP9 (GPGLM) could up-regulate the expression levels of Nrf2, NQO1 and HO-1 (p < 0.05), which further increased the activity of downstream proteases (SOD, CAT and GSH-Px), and scavenged reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreased the intracellular levels of malondialdehyde (MDA).

Methods: The fifth passage of human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) was cultured for 24, 48, and 72 h with NaCl, namely, the control (270 mOsmol/kg), HS320 (320 mOsmol/kg), and HS350 (350 mOsmol/kg).

Results: The cell viability was significantly reduced after 24 h in the HS350 group and in all groups after longer incubation. AngII partly preserved the viability in the HAECs with shorter exposure and lower concentrations of NaCl.

Better knowledge of the immune system players in skeletal muscle would help to elucidate their implications in sarcopenia. Characterizing the activators of damage sensors and the downstream effectors explains the inference with skeletal muscle performance. Sarcopenia has also been linked to chronic diseases such as diabetes, metabolic syndrome and obesity. Implications of inflammatory signals from these diseases negatively affect skeletal muscle.

This study aims to explore the relationship between SIRI and mortality in sarcopenia patients. Methods We analyzed data from ten cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) spanning 1999 to 2018, selecting 3,141 sarcopenia patients. Mortality data were obtained from the National Death Index up to December 31, 2019. Participants were divided into three groups based on the ranking of their SIRI values. The association between SIRI and mortality was assessed using Cox proportional hazards models, with smooth curve fitting employed to test the correlation. Sensitivity analyses, subgroup analyses, and interaction tests were conducted to validate the stability of the findings. Results A total of 101,316 individuals were included in this study. During a median follow-up of 10.4 years (minimum follow-up time of approximately 0.08 years, maximum follow-up time of 20.75 years), 667 participants died.

Osteolytic skeletal disorders, such as osteoporosis, arise from an imbalance between the activities of osteoclasts and osteoblasts. The regulatory mechanisms underlying osteoclast differentiation, known as osteoclastogenesis, are governed by the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL)/receptor activator of NF-\u03baB (RANK)/osteoprotegerin (OPG) signaling system. In this system, the RANK, a type 1 transmembrane protein, acts as a central regulator of osteoclastogenesis through various signaling pathways. This review seeks to explore the influence of Traditional Chinese Medicines (TCM) on osteoclastogenesis, focusing on the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. This study aims to offer valuable insights into potential therapeutic strategies for managing osteolytic skeletal disorders by investigating the interaction between TCM and the regulatory mechanisms that control osteoclast function. A comprehensive literature review was conducted, concentrating on studies that examine the effects of TCM on osteoclastogenesis and the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Databases such as PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched for peer-reviewed articles, reviews, and clinical studies. The inclusion criteria focused on studies addressing the impact of TCM on osteoclast function and the associated molecular mechanisms, especially those involving the RANKL/RANK/OPG system and the NF-\u03baB pathway. The review identified several TCM compounds with regulatory effects on osteoclastogenesis. These compounds were found to modulate the NF-\u03baB pathway, influencing osteoclast differentiation and activity. Key findings highlighted the discovery of specific TCM herbs and their active ingredients that can inhibit osteoclast formation and function, promoting bone health. The mechanisms of action often involved suppressing RANKL-induced NF-\u03baB activation, a crucial process for osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption. This review underscores the potential of TCMs as therapeutic agents for osteolytic skeletal disorders through their modulation of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway.

The development of chemical tools\u2500fluorescent probes\u2500for the sensing and imaging of biomembranes is a rapidly growing research direction, stimulated by a high demand from cell biologists and biophysicists. This Account focuses on advances in these smart molecules, providing a voyage from the cell frontier\u2500plasma membranes (PM)\u2500toward intracellular membrane compartments\u2500organelles. General classification of the membrane probes can be based on targeting principles, sensing profile, and optical response. Probes for PM and organelle membranes are designed based on multiple targeting principles: conjugation with natural lipids or synthetic targeting ligands and in situ cell labeling by bio-orthogonal chemistry, conjugation to protein tags, and receptor-ligand interactions. Thus, to obtain membrane probes targeting PM with selectivity to one leaflet, we designed membrane anchor ligands based on a charged group and an alkyl chain. According to the sensing profile, we define basic membrane markers with constant emission and probes for biophysical and chemical sensing. The markers are built from classical fluorophores, exemplified by a series of bright cyanines and BODIPY dyes bearing the PM anchors (MemBright). Membrane probes for biophysical sensing are based on environment-sensitive fluorophores: (1) polarity-sensitive solvatochromic dyes; (2) viscosity-sensitive fluorescent molecular rotors; (3) mechanosensitive fluorescent flippers; and (4) voltage-sensitive electrochromic dyes. Our solvatochromic probes based on Nile Red (NR12S, NR12A, NR4A), Laurdan (Pro12A), and 3-hydroxyflavone (F2N12S) through polarity-sensing can visualize liquid ordered and disordered phases of lipid membranes, sense lipid order and its heterogeneity in cell PM, detect apoptosis, etc. Chemically sensitive probes, combining a dye, membrane-targeting ligand, and molecular recognition unit, enable the detection of pH, ions, redox species, lipids, and proteins at the biomembrane surface. In terms of the optical response profile, we can identify (1) fluorogenic (turn-on) probes, allowing background-free imaging; (2) ratiometric probes, e.g., solvatochromic probes, which enable ratiometric imaging by changing their emission/excitation color; (3) fluorescence lifetime-responsive probes, e.g., fluorescence molecular rotors and flippers, suitable for fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM); and (4) switchable probes, important for single-molecule localization microscopy. We showed that combining solvatochromic probes with on-off switching through a reversible binding specifically to cell PM enables the mapping of their biophysical properties with superior resolution. While the majority of efforts have been focused on PM, the probes for cellular organelles, such as endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, Golgi apparatus, etc., emerge rapidly. Thus, nontargeted solvatochromic probes can distinguish organelles by the emission color. Targeted solvatochromic probes based on Nile Red revealed unique signatures of polarity and lipid order of individual organelles and their different sensitivities to oxidative or mechanical stress. Lipid droplets, which are membraneless lipidic structures, constitute another interesting organelle target for probing the cell stress. Currently, we stand at the beginning of a long route with big challenges ahead, in particular (1) to achieve superior organelle specificity; (2) to label specific biomembrane leaflets, notably the inner leaflet of PM; (3) to detect lipid organization in a proximity of specific proteins; and (4) to probe biomembranes in tissues and animals.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-12-19", "synthetic_support_claim": "Nontargeted solvatochromic probes can distinguish organelles by the emission color.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "\"Biomembrane probes can be universally applied to study all types of cellular processes with equal efficiency.\""}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "46ab328107e288238a7711b6fa9a713f8f537bdf", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/46ab328107e288238a7711b6fa9a713f8f537bdf", "title": "Mapping of \u03b23-Adrenergic Receptor in Living Cells with a Ligand-Guided Fluorescent Probe.", "abstract": "Tracking the dynamic distribution of native proteins in living cells or tissues in real time is essential for understanding the functional mechanisms involved in their physiological or pathological processes.

Methods and results We integrated 12 single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets of immune cells isolated from healthy or atherosclerotic mouse aortas, and data from 11 patients (n = 4 coronary vessels, n = 7 carotid endarterectomy specimens) from two studies.

Bulk RNA sequencing data (GSE43292 and GSE28829) were used to analyzed the expression of FSCN1in AS. A cross-sectional clinical study was utilized to examine the association between FSCN1 and AS. Circulating concentrations of FSCN1 were measured using ELISA kits and assessed using logistic regression analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Apoeko mice fed with HFD and MAECs treated with oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) were established to detect the expression of FSCN1. Furthermore, we knocked down FSCN1 in MAECs to observe its influence on pyroptosis and migration. Results The HFD group had a significantly lower percentage of T cells, fibroblasts, and B cells and a significantly higher percentage of monocytes/macrophages cells. Strong interactions between endothelial cell (EC) and fibroblast in ND groups, while EC interactions with smooth muscle cells (SMC) and T cells were stronger in HFD groups. Semaphorin 7 (SEMA7) mediated signaling pathways were enriched in HFD groups and targeted EC driving by SMC. FSCN1was mainly expressed in EC and had a high expression in human AS samples. The cross-sectional study identified that high level of FSCN1 was associated with increased risk of AS. We also observed that high expression of FSCN1 in ox-LDL-induced MAECs and Apoeko mice fed with HFD. Knockdown of FSCN1 reduced pyroptosis and increased the migration in MAECs.

This approach provides tolerance values to subdomains within the protein. Results: Our algorithm identified several critical regions that were conserved across multiple NLGN isoforms.

Abstract Liver cancer is a complex and challenging disease with limited treatment options and dismal prognosis. Understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms driving liver cancer progression and metastasis is crucial for developing effective therapeutic strategies. The EPH/ephrin system, which comprises a family of cell surface receptors and their corresponding ligands, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of HCC.

By inducing the down-regulation of mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 (MAdCAM-1) in the ileum, post-ABX gut recolonization by Enterocloster species drove the emigration of enterotropic \u03b14\u03b27+CD4+ regulatory T 17 cells into the tumor. These deleterious ABX effects were mimicked by oral gavage of Enterocloster species, by genetic deficiency, or by antibody-mediated neutralization of MAdCAM-1 and its receptor, \u03b14\u03b27 integrin. By contrast, fecal microbiota transplantation or interleukin-17A neutralization prevented ABX-induced immunosuppression. In independent lung, kidney, and bladder cancer patient cohorts, low serum levels of soluble MAdCAM-1 had a negative prognostic impact. Thus, the MAdCAM-1\u2013\u03b14\u03b27 axis constitutes an actionable gut immune checkpoint in cancer immunosurveillance. Description Editor\u2019s summary Immune checkpoint blockade therapy for the treatment of cancer can have reduced efficacy when antibiotics are administered and then discontinued before the start of therapy. Fidelle et al. investigated whether bacteria that rebound may affect the treatment response (see the Perspective by Pratt and Milner). Enterocloster species that recolonized the guts of mice treated with antibiotics down-regulated the expression of MAdCAM-1, the ligand for integrin \u03b14\u03b27 that helps to retain an immunosuppressive subset of T cells (Tr17 cells) within the gut. This leads to transit of Tr17 cells to tumors and tumor-draining lymph nodes, where they compromise immune checkpoint blockade therapy. In cancer patients undergoing immunotherapy, low levels of serum-soluble MAdCAM-1 correlated with intestinal dysbiosis and poor clinical outcomes for renal, bladder, and lung tumors. \u2014Priscilla N. Kelly & Seth Thomas Scanlon The MAdCAM-1\u2013 \u03b14\u03b27 interaction is a gut immune checkpoint for cancer immunosurveillance. INTRODUCTION Resistance of cancers to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) can result from antibiotic (ABX) treatment, likely as a result of a deviated gut microbiota. ABX compromise clinical outcome when administered before, rather than during, ICI administration, suggesting that bacterial recolonization following ABX discontinuation may be deleterious. Gut commensals induce the differentiation of an immunosuppressive subset of FoxP3+ retinoic acid receptor\u2013related orphan receptor-\u03b3t (ROR\u03b3t+) regulatory (Treg17) cells. Lymphocytes primed in the mesenteric lymph nodes (mLNs) or homing to the intestinal lamina propria express the \u03b14\u03b27 integrin interacting with its counter-receptor, mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1), which is expressed in high endothelial venules (HEVs). RATIONALE We hypothesized that disruption of the MAdCAM-1\u2013\u03b14\u03b27 interaction that retains Treg17 cells might cause their migration from the gut to tumors and thereby compromise the anticancer effects of ICIs. We used two complementary methods to visualize the exodus of intestinal T cells to subcutaneous tumors and tumor-draining lymph nodes (tdLNs): (i) Kaede mice expressing a fluorescent protein that is photoconverted upon ultraviolet light illumination of the ileum and (ii) the injection of carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester into mLNs. Moreover, we used transgene-enforced Madcam1 expression in the liver to locally intercept Treg17 cells during their migration. RESULTS Several classes of ABX down-regulated Madcam1 expression in ileal venules, Peyer\u2019s patches and mLNs, coinciding with the ileal exodus of \u03b14\u03b27+ T helper (Th17) and Treg17 cells toward extraintestinal tumors and tdLNs. This ABX-induced reduction in MAdCAM-1 could be explained by the recolonization of the gut by the genus Enterocloster (encompassing the E. clostridioformis species), because its oral administration was sufficient to down-regulate MAdCAM-1 expression through its effects on bile acid metabolism. Genetic or antibody-mediated neutralization of MAdCAM-1 or \u03b14\u03b27 integrin phenocopied the immunosuppressive effects of ABX, promoting resistance to ICIs targeting programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and inducing a surge in gut-derived \u03b14\u03b27+ Treg17 cells in tdLNs and tumors. Restoration of MAdCAM-1 on ileal HEV by fecal microbial transplantation or blockade of IL-17A reversed the inhibitory effects of ABX. Ectopic expression of MAdCAM-1 in the liver caused the local retention of enterotropic \u03b14\u03b27+ Treg17 cells, reducing their accumulation in tumor beds and improving immunotherapy outcomes in mice. Finally, low-serum-soluble MAdCAM-1 was identified as a proxy of intestinal dysbiosis and a robust predictor of shorter overall and progression-free survival of renal, bladder, and lung cancer patients under immunotherapy with antibodies targeting PD-1 or PD-L1. In non-small-cell lung cancer patients, the prognostic value of soluble MAdCAM-1 was independent of PD-L1 expression. CONCLUSION The relocation of enterotropic and immunosuppressive Treg17 cells to cancerous tissue (tumors and tdLNs) is repressed by the molecular interaction between the HEV addressin MAdCAM-1 and the integrin \u03b14\u03b27 expressed by Treg17 cells. Disruption of the MAdCAM-1 expression by ABX or gut dysbiosis causes the relocation of Treg17 cells into tumors, consequently compromising cancer immunosurveillance and the therapeutic efficiency of ICIs in mice and patients. MAdCAM-1 as a gut immune checkpoint for cancer immunosurveillance. Bacteria from the genus Enterocloster, for example, after discontinuation of ABX, induce the down-regulation of MAdCAM-1 in the ileal lamina propria and mLNs, inducing the exodus of the immunosuppressive \u03b14\u03b27+ Treg17 cells from the gut to cancers and tdLNs.

ICIs work by inhibiting the mechanisms that allow tumors to evade immune detection. Although ICIs have shown promising results, especially in solid tumors, patient responses vary widely due to multiple intrinsic and extrinsic factors within the tumor microenvironment. Emerging evidence suggests that the gut microbiota plays a pivotal role in modulating immune responses at the tumor site and may even influence treatment outcomes in cancer patients receiving ICIs. This review explores the complex interactions between the gut microbiota and the tumor microenvironment, examining how these interactions could impact the effectiveness of ICI therapy. Furthermore, we discuss how dysbiosis, an imbalance in gut microbiota composition, may contribute to resistance to ICIs, and highlight microbiota-targeted strategies to potentially overcome this challenge. Additionally, we review recent studies investigating the diagnostic potential of microbiota profiles in cancer patients, considering how microbial markers might aid in early detection and stratification of patient responses to ICIs.

It exhibited a short latent period of 20\u2009min and a burst size of 160 plaque-forming units (PFU) per cell.

Here we identify the known protein phosphatase PtpB from Mycobacterium tuberculosis as a phospholipid phosphatase inhibiting the host inflammasome-pyroptosis pathway. Mechanistically, PtpB dephosphorylated phosphatidylinositol-4-monophosphate and phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate in host cell membrane, thus disrupting the membrane localization of the cleaved GSDMD to inhibit cytokine release and pyroptosis of macrophages. Notably, this phosphatase activity requires PtpB binding to ubiquitin. Disrupting phospholipid phosphatase activity or the ubiquitin-interacting motif of PtpB enhanced host GSDMD-dependent immune responses and reduced intracellular pathogen survival. Thus, pathogens inhibit pyroptosis and counteract host immunity by altering host membrane composition. Description How a pathogen inhibits pyroptosis Pyroptosis is a proinflammatory form of programmed cell death adopted by mammalian hosts to control infections, but how pathogens evade this immune response remains largely unexplored. Chai et al. found that PtpB, a known protein phosphatase secreted by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, acts as a phospholipid phosphatase that dephosphorylates host plasma membrane phosphoinositides upon activation by ubiquitin to inhibit pyroptosis. These findings reveal a delicate strategy by which pathogens suppress pyroptosis by altering host membrane composition, and provide a potential tuberculosis treatment by targeting the PtpB-ubiquitin interacting interface. \u2014SMH A mycobacterial phosphatase binds ubiquitin to alter host membrane phospholipids to subvert gasdermin D\u2013mediated cell death. INTRODUCTION Pyroptosis is a proinflammatory form of programmed cell death characterized by membrane pore formation that allows the release of intracellular inflammatory mediators, a process that is elicited by the inflammasome-mediated cleavage and activation of gasdermin D (GSDMD). Growing evidence supports a critical role for pyroptosis in the control of infections by mammalian hosts, but how pathogens evade this immune response remains largely unexplored. RATIONALE Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), an ancient pathogen that causes tuberculosis (TB), has developed numerous intracellular survival strategies to evade host immunity and to drive the occurrence and development of TB. One notable feature evolved by Mtb is a set of eukaryotic-like effectors, but their host targets and regulatory roles in pathogen\u2013host interactions remain largely unclear. In this study, we sought to identify the key pathogenic regulators of inflammasome-pyroptosis pathways from Mtb eukaryotic-like effectors, information that could improve our understanding of TB pathogenesis and provide potential targets for novel anti-TB treatment. RESULTS We examined the whole genome of Mtb to predict its secreted eukaryotic-like proteins possessing eukaryotic-like motifs or domains that might target host factors directly. These Mtb effector proteins were then subjected to further experimental analyses using an inflammasome reconstitution system for screening inhibitors of inflammasome-pyroptosis pathways. Out of 201 predicted Mtb-secreted eukaryotic proteins, six Mtb proteins (Rv0153c, Rv0561c, Rv0824c, Rv0861c, Rv1515c, and Rv1679) exhibited strong inhibitory effects on both NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) and absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) inflammasome pathways. Among these proteins, PtpB (i.e., Rv0153c) was most abundantly secreted by Mtb during infection. We thus focused on PtpB and further confirmed its inhibitory effect on AIM2 or NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) secretion. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that PtpB inhibited gasdermin D (GSDMD)\u2013dependent cytokine release and pyroptosis to promote Mtb intracellular survival in macrophages. Mechanistically, Mtb-secreted PtpB could target and dephosphorylate host plasma membrane phosphatidylinositol-4-monophosphate (PI4P) and phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2] to inhibit the membrane localization of the N-terminal cleavage fragment of GSDMD (GSDMD-N), thus preventing GSDMD-mediated immune responses. This phosphoinositide phosphatase activity requires binding of PtpB to ubiquitin. Accordingly, disrupting phospholipid phosphatase activity or the unusual ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM)\u2013like domain of PtpB markedly enhanced host innate immune responses and reduced intracellular pathogen survival in mice in a GSDMD-dependent manner. CONCLUSION We demonstrate that GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis and inflammatory cytokine release play a critical role in host anti-infection immunity, which is counteracted by Mtb effector protein PtpB. Our data reveal a role of the pathogen-derived phospholipid phosphatase in the regulation of GSDMD-dependent pyroptosis and cytokine releases, extending our understanding of the elaborate regulatory mechanism of cellular inflammasome-pyroptosis signaling pathways during pathogen infection. The present study also presents a strategy by which pathogens hijack ubiquitin to inhibit host pyroptosis by altering the phospholipid composition of the host membrane. Our discovery of the PtpB UIM-like domain, which is not homologous to any human protein, may provide potential selectivity for the development of anti-TB therapies. M. tuberculosis PtpB hijacks host ubiquitin to inhibit pyroptosis through altering host membrane phospholipid composition. M. tuberculosis\u2013secreted phospholipid phosphatase PtpB is activated by interacting with host ubiquitin through a UIM-like domain, by which it dephosphorylates host plasma membrane phosphoinositides PI4P and PI(4,5)P2 to inhibit the membrane targeting of GSDMD-N, thus disrupting the inflammatory cytokine release and pyroptosis upon activation of M. tuberculosis infection\u2013triggered inflammasome activation in macrophages.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-10-14", "synthetic_support_claim": "Mycobacterial phosphatase PtpB requires binding to ubiquitin to inhibit GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis in macrophages.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "PtpB from Mycobacterium tuberculosis directly interacts with and degrades gasdermin D to prevent pyroptosis."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "a70c47510a3b8ee7a517dea859bd99e4cbb59366", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a70c47510a3b8ee7a517dea859bd99e4cbb59366", "title": "Exploring the Antimycobacterial Potential of Podocarpusflavone A from Kielmeyera membranacea: In Vitro and In Vivo Insights", "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the leading infectious causes of death worldwide, highlighting the importance of identifying new anti-TB agents.

Methods: Classical chromatography was applied for fractionation and spectrometric techniques were utilized for chemical characterization. For in vitro tests, samples were assessed against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium marinum. The toxicity and efficacy of active samples were evaluated in vivo using different zebrafish models. Chemogenomics studies were applied to predict the isolated active compound\u2019s potential mode of action. Results: We performed fractionation of K. membranacea ethanolic extract (EE) and then its dichloromethane fraction (DCM), and the biflavonoid podocarpusflavone A (PCFA) was isolated and identified as a promising active compound. The EE and PCFA were found to be non-toxic to zebrafish larvae and were able to inhibit M. tuberculosis growth extracellularly. Additionally, PCFA demonstrated antimycobacterial activity within infected macrophages, especially when combined with isoniazid. In addition, the EE, DCM, and PCFA have shown the ability to inhibit M. marinum\u2019s growth during in vivo zebrafish larvae yolk infection. Notably, PCFA also effectively countered systemic infection established through the caudal vein, showing a similar inhibitory activity profile to rifampicin, both at 32 \u00b5M.

The reduced responsiveness of cancer cells is a multifaceted phenomenon that can arise from genetic, epigenetic, and microenvironmental factors. Various mechanisms have been discovered and extensively studied, including drug inactivation, reduced intracellular drug accumulation by reduced uptake or increased efflux, drug target alteration, activation of compensatory pathways for cell survival, regulation of DNA repair and cell death, tumor plasticity, and the regulation from tumor microenvironments (TMEs). To overcome cancer resistance, a variety of strategies have been proposed, which are designed to enhance the effectiveness of cancer treatment or reduce drug resistance. These include identifying biomarkers that can predict drug response and resistance, identifying new targets, developing new targeted drugs, combination therapies targeting multiple signaling pathways, and modulating the TME. The present article focuses on the different mechanisms of drug resistance in cancer and the corresponding tackling approaches with recent updates.

Many experimental data and clinical trials have shown that combinatorial treatment could be an efficient solution for some resistance problems. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the synergistic effects of combining prodigiosin (PG), a natural compound with known anticancer properties, with the commonly used chemotherapy drugs 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), oxaliplatin, and paclitaxel. The primary objective was to identify the most potent combination that could enhance tumor cytotoxicity while minimizing drug resistance. In vitro experiments using three cancer cell lines (LoVo, HCT-116, and A549) were conducted to assess the impact of these combinations on the cell viability and proliferation. Recorded data demonstrated that the combination of 20 \u03bcM PG with 1/2 IC50 of 5-FU showed the most significant decrease in cell viability, with remaining viabilities of 28, 32, and 43% for LoVo, HCT-116, and A549 cells, respectively. This combination resulted in a notable increase in the proportion of cells in the G0/G1 phase and a decrease in the S phase of the cell cycle. These findings indicated that this combination effectively induced cell-cycle arrest. In contrast, other combinations such as PG with paclitaxel or oxaliplatin were less effective. Furthermore, molecular docking studies revealed that PG targets Akt1, a key protein in the PI3K/Akt survival pathway, providing a possible explanation for its proapoptotic effects. These findings suggested that the combination of PG with 5-FU enhanced tumor cell sensitivity to chemotherapy, potentially offering a more effective treatment strategy for overcoming drug resistance.

Meta-inflammation is characterized by the accumulation of immune cells in adipose tissue, a deregulation in the synthesis and release of adipokines and a pronounced increase in the production of proinflammatory factors. In this state, the infiltration of macrophages and their metabolic activation contributes to complex paracrine and autocrine signaling, which sustains a proinflammatory microenvironment.

Methods The traditional Chinese medicine system pharmacology database (TCMSP) was used to identify the components and potential targets of HYQB capsule. Targets related to AV were identified by screening the GeneCards, Disease Gene Network (DisGeNET) and Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) databases. The protein\u2013protein interaction (PPI) network between targets of active ingredients and AV targets was built using the STRING database. Cytoscape3.7.2 software was used to create the visualization network for the \u2018herb\u2010component\u2010target\u2019 and identify the key targets. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were utilized for functional enrichment analysis of the primary targets. Subsequently, molecular docking technology was employed to confirm the interaction between key components and core targets. Results The technique discovered 50 different active substances and 270 associated therapeutic targets in the HYQB capsule as well as predicting 70 targets for treating acne vulgaris. Cytoscape hubba plug\u2010in identified 19 key target genes, with the top 5 being TNF, IL1B, CCL2, SIRT1, IFNG, and IL10. Analysis of KEGG pathways revealed significant enrichment of immune\u2010related pathways, including TNF and IL\u201017 signaling pathways, among the target genes. The HYQB capsule also involves lipid and atherosclerosis, Th17 cell differentiation, and the AGE\u2010RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complication signaling pathways. Molecular docking results showed that quercetin, luteolin, kaempferol, and wogonin, the core components of HYQB, had good binding ability with the first 4 core targets.

Microglia work to reestablish efficiency and stop further degeneration in the early stages of AD but mainly fail in the illness\u2019s later phases. This may be caused by a number of reasons, e.g., a protracted exposure to cytokines that induce inflammation and an inappropriate accumulation of amyloid beta (A\u03b2) peptide.

The activation of TLRs and scavenger receptors, inducing the activation of numerous inflammatory pathways, including the NF-kB, JAK-STAT, and NLRP3 inflammasome, facilitates microglial phagocytosis and activation in response to these mediators. A\u03b2/tau are taken up by microglia, and their removal from the extracellular space can also have protective effects, but if the illness worsens, an environment that is constantly inflamed and overexposed to an oxidative environment might encourage continuous microglial activation, which can lead to neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, iron overload, and neurotoxicity.

Remarkably, OMV-DPG-IR820 demonstrated tumor-targeting capabilities with guidance provided by near-infrared II (NIR-II) fluorescence imaging, leading to remarkable inhibition on both primary and distant tumors and preventing metastasis without causing noticeable adverse reactions.

Current radiotherapy and chemotherapy regimens can induce drug-resistance effects in cancer tissues, such as anti-apoptosis, anti-pyroptosis, and anti-necroptosis, leading to poor clinical outcomes in the treatment of breast cancer. Ferroptosis is a novel programmed cell death modality characterized by iron overload, excessive generation of reactive oxygen species, and membrane lipid peroxidation. The occurrence of ferroptosis results from the imbalance between intracellular peroxidation mechanisms (executive system) and antioxidant mechanisms (defensive system), specifically involving iron metabolism pathways, amino acid metabolism pathways, and lipid metabolism pathways. In recent years, it has been found that ferroptosis is associated with the progression of various diseases, including tumors, hypertension, diabetes, and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Studies have confirmed that triggering ferroptosis in breast cancer cells can significantly inhibit cancer cell proliferation and invasion, and improve cancer cell sensitivity to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, making induction of ferroptosis a potential strategy for the treatment of breast cancer.

We show in this paper that the tumor cell\u2019s surroundings are not simply \u2018bystanders\u2019 but are actively involved in tumor growth and can cause resistance to treatment. Initially, cells and ECM around tumor cells do not promote their growth but over time, tumor cells \u2018convert\u2019 their surroundings to promote their growth. An increase in tumor size means tumor cells must overcome a lack of oxygen and nutrients, be able to remove waste and form secondary tumors. A better knowledge of tumor cells and their surrounding means better drugs for tumor cells and their surroundings. Abstract Tumorigenesis is a complex and dynamic process involving cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions that allow tumor cell growth, drug resistance and metastasis. This review provides an updated summary of the role played by the tumor microenvironment (TME) components and hypoxia in tumorigenesis, and highlight various ways through which tumor cells reprogram normal cells into phenotypes that are pro-tumorigenic, including cancer associated- fibroblasts, -macrophages and -endothelial cells. Tumor cells secrete numerous factors leading to the transformation of a previously anti-tumorigenic environment into a pro-tumorigenic environment. Once formed, solid tumors continue to interact with various stromal cells, including local and infiltrating fibroblasts, macrophages, mesenchymal stem cells, endothelial cells, pericytes, and secreted factors and the ECM within the tumor microenvironment (TME). The TME is key to tumorigenesis, drug response and treatment outcome. Importantly, stromal cells and secreted factors can initially be anti-tumorigenic, but over time promote tumorigenesis and induce therapy resistance. To counter hypoxia, increased angiogenesis leads to the formation of new vascular networks in order to actively promote and sustain tumor growth via the supply of oxygen and nutrients, whilst removing metabolic waste. Angiogenic vascular network formation aid in tumor cell metastatic dissemination. Successful tumor treatment and novel drug development require the identification and therapeutic targeting of pro-tumorigenic components of the TME including cancer-associated- fibroblasts (CAFs) and -macrophages (CAMs), hypoxia, blocking ECM-receptor interactions, in addition to the targeting of tumor cells.

Methods Our study utilized diverse analytical approaches, encompassing Cox regression models, single-cell RNA sequencing, intercellular communication analysis, and Gene Ontology enrichment. We also conducted mutation profiling and explored potential immunotherapeutic agents. Furthermore, in vitro cellular experiments and in vivo mouse models were performed to validate findings. These methodologies aimed to establish deubiquitination-related gene signatures (DRGS) for predicting ESCC patient outcomes and response to immunotherapy. Results By integrating datasets from TCGA-ESCC and GSE53624, we developed a DRGS model based on 14 deubiquitination-related genes (DUBGs). This signature effectively forecasts ESCC prognosis, drug responsiveness, and immune cell infiltration patterns. It also influences the mutational landscape of patients. Those classified as high-risk exhibited reduced survival rates, increased genetic alterations, and more complex cellular interactions, potentially explaining their poor outcomes. Notably, in vitro and in vivo experiments identified MTOR, a key component of the signature, as a promising therapeutic target for ESCC treatment.

Increasing evidence from large human microbiome studies suggests that functional consequences of changes in the intestinal microbiome may provide more power for studying their impact on inflammation and immune responses. Although 16S rRNA analysis is one of the most popular and a cost-effective method to profile the microbial compositions, marker-gene sequencing cannot provide direct information about the functional genes that are present in the genomes of community members. Bioinformatic tools have been developed to predict microbiome function with 16S rRNA gene data. Among them, PICRUSt2 (Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States) has become one of the most popular functional profile prediction tools, which generates community-wide pathway abundances. However, no state-of-art inference tools are available to test the differences in pathway abundances between comparison groups. We have developed ggpicrust2, an R package, for analyzing functional profiles derived from 16S rRNA sequencing. This powerful tool enables researchers to conduct extensive differential abundance analyses and generate visually appealing visualizations that effectively highlight functional signals. With ggpicrust2, users can obtain publishable results and gain deeper insights into the functional composition of their microbial communities.

Different from previous efforts using polyester fiber columns for EV separations, nylon\u20106 shows potential for increased isolation efficiency, including somewhat higher column loading capacity and more gentle EV elution solvent strength. The efficacy of this approach to EV separation has been determined by scanning electron and transmission microscopy, nanoparticle flow cytometry (NanoFCM), and Bradford protein assays.

We determined that CRC patients resistant to bevacizumab treatment presented with elevated levels of histone lactylation and inhibition of histone lactylation efficiently suppressed CRC tumorigenesis, progression and survival in hypoxia. Histone lactylation promoted the transcription of RUBCNL/Pacer, facilitating autophagosome maturation through interacting with BECN1 (beclin 1) and mediating the recruitment and function of the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex, which had a crucial role in hypoxic cancer cells proliferation and survival.

Conversely, restricting feeding to the active period mitigates metabolic syndrome through mechanisms that remain unknown. We found that genetic enhancement of adipocyte thermogenesis through ablation of the zinc finger protein 423 (ZFP423) attenuated obesity caused by consumption of a high-fat diet during the inactive (light) period by increasing futile creatine cycling in mice. Circadian control of adipocyte creatine metabolism underlies the timing of diet-induced thermogenesis, and enhancement of adipocyte circadian rhythms through overexpression of the clock activator brain and muscle Arnt-like protein-1 (BMAL1) ameliorated metabolic complications during diet-induced obesity. These findings uncover rhythmic creatine-mediated thermogenesis as an essential mechanism that drives metabolic benefits during time-restricted feeding.

Hepler et al. clarified the mechanism behind such differential energy handling (see the Perspective by Lagarde and Kazak). In their experiments, mice fed an HFD consumed during the active phase of their daily cycle (nighttime for a mouse) had greater energy expenditure resulting from the metabolism of food to produce heat. Such thermogenesis depended on the circadian clock of adipocytes and on increased synthesis of creatine, fueling a futile cycle of ATP turnover in the mitochondria of adipocytes.

Association of maternal eating pattern with alterations in infant BAZ gain and nutritional status at age 6 months were investigated in multiple regression analyses.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCompared with maternal daytime eating, maternal nighttime eating was linked to a greater increase in infantile BAZ from ages 2 to 6 months (adjusted \u03b2\u2009=\u20090.49; 95% CI, 0.05-0.92; P\u2009=\u20090.03) and a heightened likelihood of being overweight at age 6 months (adjusted odds ratio\u2009=\u20093.81; 95% CI, 1.41-6.63; P\u2009=\u20090.01) after adjusting for factors including maternal age, education level, household income, parity, pregestational body mass index, BAZ at 2 months, total daily energy consumption, and the percentages of energy derived from macronutrients.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nDisruption of rhythmic physiology from irregular eating habits can lead to circadian misalignment, which may result in abnormal weight gain in infants and an increased likelihood of being overweight in the early postnatal period.

We analyzed mitochondrial gene expression in nasopharyngeal and autopsy tissues from patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In nasopharyngeal samples with declining viral titers, the virus blocked the transcription of a subset of nuclear DNA (nDNA)\u2013encoded mitochondrial OXPHOS genes, induced the expression of microRNA 2392, activated HIF-1\u03b1 to induce glycolysis, and activated host immune defenses including the integrated stress response. In autopsy tissues from patients with COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 was no longer present, and mitochondrial gene transcription had recovered in the lungs. However, nDNA mitochondrial gene expression remained suppressed in autopsy tissue from the heart and, to a lesser extent, kidney, and liver, whereas mitochondrial DNA transcription was induced and host-immune defense pathways were activated. During early SARS-CoV-2 infection of hamsters with peak lung viral load, mitochondrial gene expression in the lung was minimally perturbed but was down-regulated in the cerebellum and up-regulated in the striatum even though no SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the brain. During the mid-phase SARS-CoV-2 infection of mice, mitochondrial gene expression was starting to recover in mouse lungs. These data suggest that when the viral titer first peaks, there is a systemic host response followed by viral suppression of mitochondrial gene transcription and induction of glycolysis leading to the deployment of antiviral immune defenses. Even when the virus was cleared and lung mitochondrial function had recovered, mitochondrial function in the heart, kidney, liver, and lymph nodes remained impaired, potentially leading to severe COVID-19 pathology.

Emerging research indicates that ferroptosis in hepatocytes plays a role in the development of alcoholic liver disease. This study aimed to reveal the effect and potential mechanism of ECH on MASLD. Methods: The effect of ECH on the viability, lipid deposition, lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial of OA/PA-treated HepG2 cells were evaluated by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, JC-1 and immunofluorescence assay. Meanwhile, the mechanism of ECH was assessed using transmission electron microscopy and immunofluorescence analysis.

Results: ECH attenuated lipid deposition, lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis induced by OA/PA in HepG2 cells. Mitochondrial morphology and function in HepG2 cells were also preserved by ECH. In db/db mice model of MASLD, ECH markedly ameliorated liver hepatocellular ballooning, inflammatory cell infiltration in the portal area, and fibrous tissue proliferation.

In diseases of aging, modifiable factors can be compounded over the life span. We report that diet-induced obesity earlier in life triggers persistent reprogramming of the innate immune system, lasting long after normalization of metabolic abnormalities. Stearic acid, acting through Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), is sufficient to remodel chromatin landscapes and selectively enhance accessibility at binding sites for activator protein-1 (AP-1). Myeloid cells show less oxidative phosphorylation and shift to glycolysis, ultimately leading to proinflammatory cytokine transcription, aggravation of pathological retinal angiogenesis, and neuronal degeneration associated with loss of visual function. Thus, a past history of obesity reprograms mononuclear phagocytes and predisposes to neuroinflammation. Description Lingering immune changes after obesity A past period of obesity caused by a high-fat diet in mice produces persistent changes in innate immunity even after weight loss and normalization of metabolism. Hata et al. found that such diet-induced obesity in mice, even after it was resolved, led to persistent epigenetic changes in chromatin in macrophages associated with increased expression of genes that function in inflammatory responses (see the Perspective by Mangum and Gallagher).

Next, scRNA-seq was performed to screen the key genes of bese patients with PCOS. Part 2: Active ingredients of CFDT and obesity-related PCOS targets were identified based on public databases, and the binding ability between the active ingredients and targets was analyzed. Part 3: This part was a monocentric, randomized controlled trial. The obese women with PCOS were randomized to CFDT (6 packets/day) or placebo, and the healthy women were included in the blank control group (43 cases per group).

The proportions of T, B, and natural killer cells were higher in patients with PCOS compared to healthy women, with even higher proportions observed in obese patients with PCOS. Gene ontology and the Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes analysis depicted that the differentially expressed genes were related to immune regulation pathways.

Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NFE2L2, also known as NRF2) is key for cellular antioxidant responses, which promotes downstream genes transcription by binding to their antioxidant response elements (AREs). Numerous studies suggest that NRF2 assumes an extremely important role in the regulation of ferroptosis, for its various functions in iron, lipid, and amino acid metabolism, and so on. Many pathological states are relevant to ferroptosis. Abnormal suppression of ferroptosis is found in many cases of cancer, promoting their progression and metastasis. While during tissue damages, ferroptosis is recurrently promoted, resulting in a large number of cell deaths and even dysfunctions of the corresponding organs. Therefore, targeting NRF2-related signaling pathways, to induce or inhibit ferroptosis, has become a great potential therapy for combating cancers, as well as preventing neurodegenerative and ischemic diseases. In this review, a brief overview of the research process of ferroptosis over the past decade will be presented.

Methods We established S-AKI models in vivo via CLP and in vitro with LPS-induced HK-2 cells. Results The Nrf2/SLC7A11/FSP1/CoQ10 pathway was inhibited in S-AKI both in vitro and in vivo. The overexpression of Nrf2 inhibited LPS-induced ferroptosis by activating the SLC7A11/FSP1/CoQ10 pathway. DEX ameliorated kidney tissue damage, as determined by a decrease in BUN, Cr, and inflammatory factor levels, along with renal tubule vacuolation and inflammatory cell infiltration in S-AKI mice. Additionally, DEX treatment significantly ameliorated ferroptosis in S-AKI in vitro and in vivo, as indicated by an improvement in mitochondrial shrinkage and disruption of cristae, a decrease in iron, ROS, MDA, and 4-HNE levels, and an increase in GSH and GPX4 levels. Mechanistically, DEX treatment restored the reduction of Nrf2 expression and nuclear translocation in S-AKI, as well as, the levels of downstream SLC7A11, FSP1, and CoQ10.

The aerogel platform is constructed by embedding chitosan\u2010protected platinum nanoparticles (Pt\u2010CS NPs), which exhibit intrinsic peroxidase (POD) activity, within a polyacrylic acid (PAA) aerogel matrix. This hybrid Pt\u2010CS/PAA aerogel retains the shape\u2010memory effect of the PAA component as well as the POD activity of the Pt\u2010CS NPs.

Based on our previous work, this study was conducted to further investigate the therapeutic effects of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) on ovariectomized (OVX) model rats and the immunological and microecological mechanisms involved. Results We found a protective effect of LGG treatment in OVX rats through changes in bone microarchitecture, bone biomechanics, and CTX-I, PINP, Ca, and RANKL expression levels. LGG was more advantageous in promoting osteogenesis, which may be responsible for the alleviation of osteoporosis. Th17 cells were imbalanced with Treg cells in mediastinal lymph nodes and bone marrow, with ROR\u03b3t and FOXP3 expression following a similar trend. TNF-\u03b1 and IL-17 expression in colon and bone marrow increased, while TGF-\u03b2 and IL-10 expression decreased; however, LGG treatment modulated these changes and improved the Th17/Treg balance significantly. Regarding the intestinal barrier, we found that LGG treatment ameliorated estrogen deficiency-induced inflammation and mucosal damage and increased the expression of GLP-2\u2009R and tight junction proteins. Importantly, 16S rRNA sequencing showed a significant increase in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio during estrogen deficiency. Dominant intestinal flora showed significant differences in composition; LGG treatment regulated the various genera that were imbalanced in OVX, along with modifying those that did not change significantly in other groups with respect to the intestinal barrier, inflammation development, and bile acid metabolism. Conclusions Overall, LGG ameliorated estrogen deficiency-induced osteoporosis by regulating the gut microbiome and intestinal barrier and stimulating Th17/Treg balance in gut and bone.

Osteoclast (OC) activity and circadian rhythm play a role in the pathogenesis of OP. Melatonin is a circadian regulator that affects bone metabolism, but its molecular mechanism has not been studied in detail. This study aimed to identify the relationship between melatonin\u2010related genes and OP through bioinformatics methods and to verify it experimentally.We analysed microarray data from the GSE35959 dataset, identifying differentially expressed genes in OP patients. Circadian rhythm\u2010related genes and melatonin\u2010related genes intersect with these differentially expressed genes, highlighting that CSNK1D is a central gene. Functional enrichment, correlation and protein\u2013protein interaction analyses were conducted. Experimental validation involved in vitro differentiation assays using RAW264.7 cells and in vivo studies with an ovariectomy\u2010induced rat model of OP to evaluate the role of CSNK1D in osteoclastogenesis to verify its effect on OP. Differential expression analysis revealed 272 significant genes, with CSNK1D identified as central to the circadian rhythm and to melatonin and OP interplay. Functional analyses showed involvement of CSNK1D in OC differentiation and inflammatory pathways. in vitro experiments confirmed CSNK1D upregulation during OC differentiation, and small interfering RNA\u2010mediated knockdown reduced OC marker expression and TRAP+ cell formation. in vivo, CSNK1D expression is associated with bone loss in OP rats.

Ruminants establish a symbiotic relationship with their microbiome, and the latter is the workhorse of carbohydrate fermentation. On the other hand, during carbohydrate fermentation, synthesis of propionate sequesters H, thus reducing its availability for the ultimate production of methane (CH4) by methanogenic archaea. Biochemically, methane is the simplest alkane and represents a downturn in energetic efficiency in ruminants; environmentally, it constitutes a potent greenhouse gas that negatively affects climate change. Prevotella is a very versatile microbe capable of processing a wide range of proteins and polysaccharides, and one of its fermentation products is propionate, a trait that appears conspicuous in P. ruminicola strain 23. Since propionate, but not acetate or butyrate, constitutes an H sink, propionate-producing microbes have the potential to reduce methane production. Accordingly, numerous studies suggest that members of the genus Prevotella have the ability to divert the hydrogen flow in glycolysis away from methanogenesis and in favor of propionic acid production. Intended for a broad audience in microbiology, our review summarizes the biochemistry of carbohydrate fermentation and subsequently discusses the evidence supporting the essential role of Prevotella in lignocellulose processing and its association with reduced methane emissions.

To investigate the origins and impact of such plasticity, we performed single-cell analyses on normal, inflamed, premalignant, and malignant tissues in autochthonous models of pancreatic cancer. We reproducibly identified heterogeneous cell states that are primed for diverse, late-emerging neoplastic fates and linked these to chromatin remodeling at cell-cell communication loci. Using an inference approach, we revealed signaling gene modules and tissue-level cross-talk, including a neoplasia-driving feedback loop between discrete epithelial and immune cell populations that was functionally validated in mice. Our results uncover a neoplasia-specific tissue-remodeling program that may be exploited for pancreatic cancer interception. Description Editor\u2019s summary The development of pancreatic cancer involves a complex interplay between pancreatic lesions and the surrounding tissue microenvironment. Burdziak et al. performed an in-depth analysis of the evolution of pancreatic tumors. Using several model systems, including newly developed computational methods, tumor progression stages leading to pancreatic adenocarcinoma were predicted based upon communication gene modules. Tissue remodeling was traced from a healthy pancreas to an inflamed state, the premalignant stage, and then to full-blown malignancy and distant metastasis. Epigenetic plasticity in early progenitor\u2013like epithelial cells primed pancreatic cells for neoplastic transformation. Plasticity was associated with the remodeling of accessible chromatin close to cell-cell signaling genes and an interleukin-33\u2013mediated inflammatory feedback loop between epithelial and immune cells. \u2014Priscilla N. Kelly Single-cell analysis reveals that enhanced epigenetic plasticity drives pro-neoplastic cross-talk in early pancreatic cancer. INTRODUCTION Virtually all cancers begin with genetic alterations in healthy cells, but mounting evidence suggests that nongenetic events such as environmental signaling play a crucial role in unleashing tumorigenesis. In the pancreas, epithelial cells harboring an activating mutation in the Kras proto-oncogene can remain phenotypically normal until an inflammatory event that drives cellular plasticity and tissue remodeling. The inflammation-driven molecular, cellular, and tissue changes that precede and direct tumor formation remain poorly understood. RATIONALE Understanding tumorigenesis requires a high-resolution view of events spanning cancer progression. We leveraged genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs), single-cell genomics (RNA sequencing and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing), and imaging technologies to measure pancreatic epithelial cell states across physiological, premalignant, and malignant stages. To analyze this rich and complex dataset, we developed computational and functional approaches to characterize epigenetic plasticity and to infer cell-cell communication impacts on tissue remodeling. RESULTS Our data revealed that early in tumorigenesis, Kras-mutant cells are capable of acquiring multiple highly reproducible cell states that are undetectable in normal or regenerating pancreata. Several such states align with experimentally validated cells of origin of neoplastic lesions, some of which display a high degree of plasticity upon inflammatory insult. These diverse Kras-mutant cell populations are defined by distinct chromatin accessibility patterns and undergo inflammation-driven cell fate transitions that precede preneoplastic and premalignant lesion formation. Furthermore, a subset of early Kras-mutant cell states exhibit marked similarity to either benign or malignant fates that emerge weeks to months later; for instance, Kras-mutant Nestin-positive progenitor-like cells display accessible chromatin near genes active in malignant tumors. We defined and quantified epigenetic plasticity as the diversity in transcriptional phenotypes that is enabled or restricted by a given epigenetic accessibility landscape. These plastic cell states are enriched for open chromatin near cell-cell communication genes encoding ligands and cell-surface receptors, suggesting an increased propensity to communicate with the microenvironment. Given the rapid remodeling of both the epithelial and immune compartments during inflammation, we hypothesize that this epigenetically enabled communication is a major driver of tumorigenesis. We found that the premalignant epithelium displays extraordinary modularity with respect to communication gene coexpression patterns, with distinct cell subpopulations each expressing a unique set of receptors and ligands that define the nature of incoming and outgoing signals that they can receive and send. Through the development of Calligraphy, an algorithm that utilizes this receptor-ligand modularity to robustly infer the cell-cell communication underlying tissue remodeling, we showed that the enhanced signaling repertoire of early neoplastic tissue endows specific plastic epithelial populations with greater capability for cross-talk, including numerous communication routes with immune populations. As one example, we identified a feedback loop between inflammation-driven Kras-mutant epithelial and immune cell states involving interleukin-33 (IL-33), which was previously implicated in pancreatic tumorigenesis. Using a new GEMM that enables spatiotemporally controlled suppression of epithelial Il33 expression during mutant Kras-initiated neoplasia, we functionally demonstrated that the loop initiated by epithelial IL-33 directs exit from a highly plastic, inflammation-induced epithelial state, enabling progression toward typical neoplasia. CONCLUSION Multimodal single-cell profiling of tumorigenesis in mouse models identified the cellular and tissue determinants of pancreatic cancer initiation, and a rigorous quantification of plasticity enabled the discovery of plasticity-associated gene programs. We found that Kras-mutant subpopulations markedly increase epigenetic plasticity upon inflammation, reshaping their communication potential with immune cells and establishing aberrant cell-cell communication loops that drive their progression toward neoplastic lesions. A lens into epigenetic plasticity and its consequences on tumorigenesis. A genetically engineered mouse model enabled a longitudinal view of cell states in early pancreatic cancer progression, revealing plasticity endowed through epigenetic priming.

Only in the last 10 years, the accumulation of problematic data, better experimental technologies, and some ambitious models pushed the idea that epigenetics could be at least as important as genetics in early oncogenesis. Until this year, a direct demonstration of epigenetic oncogenesis was still lacking.

AMPK contributes to diverse metabolic and physiological effects besides its fundamental role in glucose and lipid metabolism. Aberrancy in AMPK signaling is one of the determining factors which lead to the development of chronic diseases such as obesity, inflammation, diabetes, and cancer. The activation of AMPK and its downstream signaling cascades orchestrate dynamic changes in the tumor cellular bioenergetics. It is well documented that AMPK possesses a suppressor role in the context of tumor development and progression by modulating the inflammatory and metabolic pathways. In addition, AMPK plays a central role in potentiating the phenotypic and functional reprogramming of various classes of immune cells which reside in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Furthermore, AMPK-mediated inflammatory responses facilitate the recruitment of certain types of immune cells to the TME, which impedes the development, progression, and metastasis of cancer. Thus, AMPK appears to play an important role in the regulation of anti-tumor immune response by regulating the metabolic plasticity of various immune cells. AMPK effectuates the metabolic modulation of anti-tumor immunity via nutrient regulation in the TME and by virtue of its molecular crosstalk with major immune checkpoints. Several studies including that from our lab emphasize on the role of AMPK in regulating the anticancer effects of several phytochemicals, which are potential anticancer drug candidates.

However, although loss of GCN2 function reduces intracellular amino acid availability and PCa growth, there is no appreciable cell death. Here, we discovered that the loss of GCN2 in PCa induces prosenescent p53 signaling. This p53 activation occurred through GCN2 inhibition-dependent reductions in purine nucleotides that impaired ribosome biogenesis and, consequently, induced the impaired ribosome biogenesis checkpoint. p53 signaling induced cell cycle arrest and senescence that promoted the survival of GCN2-deficient PCa cells.

ARF proteins contain three conserved regions: a conserved N-terminal B3 DNA-binding domain, a variable intermediate middle region domain that functions in activation or repression, and a C-terminal domain including the Phox and Bem1p region for dimerization, similar to the III and IV elements of Aux/IAA, which facilitate protein-protein interaction through homodimerization of ARF proteins or heterodimerization of ARF and Aux/IAA proteins.

Next, we cover how the different forms of released mtDNA activate specific innate immune nucleic acid sensors and inflammasomes. Finally, we discuss how intracellular and extracellular mtDNA release, including circulating cell-free mtDNA that promotes systemic inflammation, are implicated in human diseases, bacterial and viral infections, senescence and aging.", "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-03-31", "synthetic_support_claim": "Circulating cell-free mitochondrial DNA promotes systemic inflammation implicated in human diseases and aging.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Mitochondrial DNA can reverse aging and extend lifespan significantly through its influence on cellular processes."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "a6c7f599349e6b1ad106606ba3a639adc636ac89", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a6c7f599349e6b1ad106606ba3a639adc636ac89", "title": "Unraveling the cGAS/STING signaling mechanism: impact on glycerolipid metabolism and diseases", "abstract": "The cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) and its downstream effector, the stimulator of interferon genes (STING), are crucial components of the innate immune response, traditionally recognized for their role in detecting cytosolic DNA from pathogens and damaged host cells.

Glycerolipids are essential for energy storage and cellular membrane integrity, and their dysregulation is linked to metabolic disorders such as obesity, insulin resistance, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Both cGAS and STING are expressed in various metabolic tissues, suggesting a potential role in lipid homeostasis.

Indeed, we found that STING activation induced a pH increase in the Golgi and that STING reconstituted in liposomes enabled transmembrane proton transport. Compound 53 (C53), a STING agonist that binds the putative channel interface, blocked STING-induced proton flux in the Golgi and in liposomes.

NOD\u2010like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3)\u2013mediated pyroptosis is a type of proinflammatory cell death, which can exacerbate significant muscle cell loss and adverse remodelling. The stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is an essential molecule involved in the regulation of inflammation and immune responses across various diseases. The regulatory mechanism by which STING affects muscle pyroptosis in diabetic myopathy remains unclear. Methods STING\u2010knockout and wild\u2010type (WT) mice underwent intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ). STING small interfering RNA (siRNA) was transfected into fully differentiated C2C12 myotubes prior to glucose treatment. Muscle function tests, body composition analysis, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, western blotting, immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, histology, enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction were performed. Co\u2010immunoprecipitation assays were employed to investigate the interaction between STING and NLRP3. Results STING expression was elevated in the gastrocnemius muscle (GM) tissues of WT diabetic mice. STING\u2010deficient diabetic mice exhibited pronounced hyperglycaemia accompanied by hypoinsulinaemia, with no significant difference compared with WT diabetic mice. However, STING\u2010deficient diabetic mice demonstrated a significantly increased body weight and lean mass. A significant decrease in muscle weight, myofibrillar diameter and area, muscle function, and the expression of genes related to muscle atrophy (MuRF1, Atrogin1) were observed in WT diabetic mice, which was mitigated in STING\u2010deficient diabetic mice. STING deficiency reduced the number of GSDMD\u2010N formed pores and pyroptosis\u2010related components (NLRP3, caspase\u20101, cle\u2010caspase\u20101, GSDMD, and GSDMD\u2010N) in the GM tissues and was associated with a reduction in inflammatory chemokines. Similar changes were observed in vitro with glucose\u2010induced myotube atrophy and pyroptosis as seen in vivo. Activation of STING by the agonist diABZI exacerbated muscle atrophy and pyroptosis in C2C12 myotubes. Co\u2010localization of STING and NLRP3 was observed, and the interaction between STING and NLRP3 was enhanced in GM tissues from WT diabetic mice. We also found that STING could activate NLRP3 dependent on its channel activity, which can be attenuated by treated with C53 (an inhibitor of STING's ion\u2010channel function). Conclusions In conclusion, our results indicate that STING\u2010induced activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome leads to pyroptosis, resulting in muscle atrophy and dysfunction.

However, a thorough characterization of this heterogeneity remains elusive due to the labor-intensive and time-consuming nature of these experiments. To address these challenges, we introduce ChromoGen, a generative model based on state-of-the-art artificial intelligence techniques that efficiently predicts three-dimensional, single-cell chromatin conformations de novo with both region and cell type specificity. These generated conformations accurately reproduce experimental results at both the single-cell and population levels. Moreover, ChromoGen successfully transfers to cell types excluded from the training data using just DNA sequence and widely available DNase-seq data, thus providing access to chromatin structures in myriad cell types. These achievements come at a remarkably low computational cost. Therefore, ChromoGen enables the systematic investigation of single-cell chromatin organization, its heterogeneity, and its relationship to sequencing data, all while remaining economical.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-01-31", "synthetic_support_claim": "ChromoGen accurately predicts single-cell chromatin conformations with cell type specificity using AI.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "ChromoGen provides real-time analysis of chromatin dynamics in living cells without any experimental intervention."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "28d2839f0fcb08466e89269c3f48538b719f69f5", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/28d2839f0fcb08466e89269c3f48538b719f69f5", "title": "compleasm: a faster and more accurate reimplementation of BUSCO", "abstract": "Abstract Motivation Evaluating the gene completeness is critical to measuring the quality of a genome assembly. An incomplete assembly can lead to errors in gene predictions, annotation, and other downstream analyses. Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) is a widely used tool for assessing the completeness of genome assembly by testing the presence of a set of single-copy orthologs conserved across a wide range of taxa. However, BUSCO is slow particularly for large genome assemblies. It is cumbersome to apply BUSCO to a large number of assemblies. Results Here, we present compleasm, an efficient tool for assessing the completeness of genome assemblies. Compleasm utilizes the miniprot protein-to-genome aligner and the conserved orthologous genes from BUSCO. It is 14 times faster than BUSCO for human assemblies and reports a more accurate completeness of 99.6% than BUSCO\u2019s 95.7%, which is in close agreement with the annotation completeness of 99.5% for T2T-CHM13.

This tribe is widely distributed, notably throughout the tropics of Africa, Southeast Asia and the Americas, making it a fascinating model in evolutionary biology. However, despite accounting for 25% of the global swallowtail butterfly diversity, Leptocircini have been surprisingly neglected in phylogenetic analyses. This has left unanswered questions about their taxonomy and systematics. Here, we present a new taxonomic working list for Leptocircini, featuring 162 valid species. Using a combination of long and short reads data, we produced five new reference genomes, and we generated highly covered and scaffolded whole genomes for 148 individuals to infer densely sampled phylogenetic hypotheses. Based on mitochondrial or thousands of nuclear genes and multiple phylogenetic approaches, a robust phylogenomic tree is recovered, representing approximately 90% of the known species, which allowed examination of several key phylogenetic hypotheses. We found the monotypic genus Protographium Munroe to be sister of genus Graphium Scopoli. Additionally, we found that subgenus Paranticopsis Wood\u2010Mason and de Nic\u00e9ville is nested within subgenus Pathysa Reakirt, which we found is likely attributed to an ancient gene flow. We therefore synonymize Paranticopsis, syn.rest. To keep a consistent approach to subgeneric classification across the tribe and family, we devided genus Eurytides H\u00fcbner into three subgenera: Mimoides Brown, Eurytides sensu stricto and Protesilaus Swainson. This led to several taxonomic implications: Asiographium M\u00f6hn, syn.rest., Boreographium Grishin, syn.n., Hyalaus Grishin, syn.n. and Neographium M\u00f6hn, syn.n. are synonymized with Eurytides (Mimoides); and Eurygraphium M\u00f6hn, syn.rest. is synonymized with Eurytides (Eurytides). Our analyses finally raised concerns about potential taxonomic inflation in two species\u2010groups within Graphium and Eurytides (Protesilaus).

Despite progress in measuring germline mutation rates across diverse taxa, such estimates are missing for much of Earth's biodiversity. Here, we present the first estimate of a germline mutation rate from the phylum Mollusca. We sequenced three pedigreed families of the white abalone Haliotis sorenseni, a long-lived, large-bodied, and critically endangered mollusk, and estimated a de novo mutation rate of 8.60 \u00d7 10\u22129 single nucleotide mutations per site per generation. This mutation rate is similar to rates measured in vertebrates with comparable generation times and longevity to abalone, and higher than mutation rates measured in faster-reproducing invertebrates. The spectrum of de novo mutations is also similar to that seen in vertebrate species, although an excess of rare C > A polymorphisms in wild individuals suggests that a modifier allele or environmental exposure may have once increased C > A mutation rates. We use our rate to infer baseline effective population sizes (Ne) across multiple Pacific abalone and find that abalone persisted over most of their evolutionary history as large and stable populations, in contrast to extreme fluctuations over recent history and small census sizes in the present day. We then use our mutation rate to infer the timing and pattern of evolution of the abalone genus Haliotis, which was previously unknown due to few fossil calibrations. Our findings are an important step toward understanding mutation rate evolution and they establish a key parameter for conservation and evolutionary genomics research in mollusks.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-01-01", "synthetic_support_claim": "We provide the first estimate of a germline mutation rate from the phylum Mollusca.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Mollusks have higher de novo mutation rates than all vertebrates with comparable generation times and longevity."}}]
