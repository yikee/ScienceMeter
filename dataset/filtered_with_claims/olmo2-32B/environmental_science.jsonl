However, feedbacks within the carbon cycle place intrinsic limits on the long-term impact of CDR on atmospheric CO2 that are likely to vary across CDR technologies in ways that are poorly constrained. Here, we use an ensemble of Earth system models to provide new insights into the efficiency of CDR through enhanced rock weathering (ERW) by explicitly quantifying long-term storage of carbon in the ocean during ERW relative to an equivalent modulated emissions scenario. We find that although the backflux of CO2 to the atmosphere in the face of CDR is in all cases significant and time-varying, even for direct removal and underground storage, the leakage of initially captured carbon associated with ERW is well below that currently assumed. In addition, net alkalinity addition to the surface ocean from ERW leads to significant increases in seawater carbonate mineral saturation state relative to an equivalent emissions trajectory, a co-benefit for calcifying marine organisms. These results suggest that potential carbon leakage from the oceans during ERW is a small component of the overall ERW life cycle and that it can be rigorously quantified and incorporated into technoeconomic assessments of ERW at scale.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-04-01", "synthetic_support_claim": "The leakage of initially captured carbon associated with enhanced rock weathering is well below assumed levels.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Negative emissions technologies have no impact on the long-term concentration of atmospheric CO2."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "355ad3cd03a13daa6c4cda9b8ac26b6d7b8a2475", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/355ad3cd03a13daa6c4cda9b8ac26b6d7b8a2475", "title": "Enhanced Rock Weathering for Carbon Removal\u2013Monitoring and Mitigating Potential Environmental Impacts on Agricultural Land", "abstract": "Terrestrial enhanced rock weathering (ERW) is the application of pulverized silicate rock to soils for the purposes of carbon removal and improved soil health.

Such a production platform is an integrated intensified biorefinery (IIBR), used as an alternative to large-scale centralized production which relies on green electricity and CCUS. Hence, the capacity and availability of the renewable biomass and unavoidable waste were examined. The critical elements of the IIBR include gasification/syngas production; syngas cleaning; electricity generation; and the conversion of clean syngas (which contains H2, CO, CH4, CO2 and N2) to the primary products using nonthermal plasma catalytic reactors with in situ NH3 sequestration for SA fertilizers. The status of these critical elements is critically reviewed with regard to their techno-economics and suitability for industrial applications. Using novel gasifiers powered by a combination of CO2, H2O and O2-enhanced air as the oxidant, it is possible to obtain syngas with high H2 concentration suitable for NH3 synthesis. Gasifier performances for syngas generation and cleaning, electricity production and emissions are evaluated and compared with gasifiers at 50 kWe and 1\u20132 MWe scales. The catalyst and plasma catalytic reactor systems for NH3 production with or without in situ reactive sequestration are considered in detail. The performance of the catalysts in different plasma reactions is widely different. The high intensity power (HIP) processing of perovskite (barium titanate) and unary/binary spinel oxide catalysts (or their combination) performs best in several syntheses, including NH3 production, NOx from air and fertigation fertilizers from plasma-activated water. These catalysts can be represented as BaTi1\u2212vO3\u2212x{#}yNz (black, piezoelectric barium titanate, bp-{BTO}) and M(1)3\u2212jM(2)kO4\u2212m{#}nNr/SiO2 (unary (k = 0) or a binary (k > 0) silane-coated SiO2-supported spinel oxide catalyst, denoted as M/Si = X) where {#} infers oxygen vacancy. HIP processing in air causes oxygen vacancies, nitrogen substitution, the acquisition of piezoelectric state and porosity and chemical/morphological heterogeneity, all of which make the catalysts highly active. Their morphological evaluation indicates the generation of dust particles (leading to porogenesis), 2D-nano/micro plates and structured ribbons, leading to quantum effects under plasma catalytic synthesis, including the acquisition of high-energy particles from the plasma space to prevent product dissociation as a result of electron impact. M/Si = X (X > 1/2) and bp-{BTO} catalysts generate plasma under microwave irradiation (including pulsed microwave) and hence can be used in a packed bed mode in microwave plasma reactors with plasma on and within the pores of the catalyst. Such reactors are suitable for electric-powered small-scale industrial operations. When combined with the in situ reactive separation of NH3 in the so-called Multi-Reaction Zone Reactor using NH3 sequestration agents to create SA fertilizers, the techno-economics of the plasma catalytic synthesis of fertilizers become favorable due to the elimination of product separation costs and the quality of the SA fertilizers which act as an artificial root system. The SA fertilizers provide soil fertility, biodiversity, high yield, efficient water and nutrient use and carbon sequestration through mineralization. They can prevent environmental damage and help plants and crops to adapt to the emerging harsh environmental and climate conditions through the formation of artificial rhizosphere and rhizosheath.

As such, in the U.S., various parties have proposed large-scale forest management efforts to enhance biodiversity conservation and carbon sequestration. Others, in contrast, argue that forests should not be harvested and have used legal action to prevent timber harvest on public lands. However, given that modern forests in the U.S. are reduced in extent compared to pre-settlement times, are subject to a reduced rate of natural disturbances but experience novel disturbances such as invasive pests and elevated fire risk, and are out of ecological balance due to past human activities, we suggest that active management is not only aligned with forest sustainability but necessary to conserve the maximum feasible range of forest biodiversity. In many areas of the U.S., species most in need of conservation depend on open canopy or early seral forest conditions, both of which can be created or maintained by forest harvest. We suggest that forest management for wood products simultaneously produces these needed conditions, whereas setting aside forests from management only benefits a subset of biodiversity. Although areas not subjected to forest harvest are important landscape components, active management is also needed to restore once-common forest types such as oak (Quercus spp.) woodland, mitigate invasive pests, reduce fire risk, and manage for species that need early seral or disturbed conditions, which are declining on the landscape.

We parameterized our models with literature data and calibrated them through a Delphi expert\u2010elicitation process. We simulated population trajectories under a hypothetical, threat\u2010free, baseline versus different threat scenarios.Under combined threats of hunting and habitat loss, jaguar and puma populations declined by 88% and 80%, respectively, compared to range contractions of 48% and 35%, respectively. Both species remained regionally viable, particularly due to large protected areas, which acted as population sources but were surrounded by strong sinks. We observed a widespread weakening of the top carnivore guild function, with at least one species extirpated across 67% of the Chaco and strong declines (>\u200980%; considered here as functional loss) for both species concurrently across 61% of their area of historical co\u2010occurrence.

Here, we compared drought resistance and resilience in natural and planted forests across China using satellite observations from 2001 to 2020 to understand which forests were at higher risk of drought.

Pseudomonas putida actively forms biofilms to protect the population under tetracycline stress, but the molecular mechanism remains unclear. This study found that tetracycline at sub-minimal inhibitory concentrations increased cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP), a second messenger that positively regulates biofilm formation. Four c-di-GMP-metabolizing proteins were found to be involved in the tetracycline-mediated biofilm promotion, including DibA, WspR, PP_3242, and PP_3319. Among them, the diguanylate cyclase WspR displayed the most significant effect on c-di-GMP level and biofilm formation. WspR belongs to the wsp operon comprising seven genes (wspA\u2013wspF and wspR). The wsp operon contained six promoters, including one major start promoter (PwspA) and five internal promoters (PwspB, PwspC, PwspD, PwspF, and PwspR), and tetracycline promoted the activity of PwspA. The stress-response sigma factor RpoS directly bound to PwspA and positively regulated its activity under tetracycline stress. Moreover, RpoS was required for tetracycline to induce PwspA activity and promote biofilm formation. Our results enrich the transcriptional regulation of the wsp operon and reveal the mechanism by which tetracycline promotes biofilm formation in P. putida.

The Pseudomonas putida actively forms biofilm against antibiotic threats, but the mechanism remains unclear. Here, our results showed that tetracycline treatment at sub-minimal inhibitory concentrations could induce the expression of the Wsp system via the sigma factor RpoS in P. putida, resulting in elevated c-di-GMP levels, which leads to increased biofilm formation.

This review article assesses the human and environmental health impacts of SWM practices in the Global South cities that are the future of global urbanization. The study employs desktop research methodology based on in-depth analysis of secondary data and literature, including official documents and published articles.

This paper analyzes the two-pronged effects of AVs, showing both the advantages and disadvantages that may arise. With their enhanced fuel efficiency, integrated electric vehicle technology, and driving behaviors, autonomous vehicles (AVs) have the potential to drastically reduce emissions and have a positive environmental impact. Lower carbon footprints could also be achieved by improved urban design and the possibility of less traffic congestion. In terms of the economy, AVs present chances for new transportation service business models, lower accident-related costs, and cost reductions in logistics. Nevertheless, there are drawbacks to these developments as well, such as high upfront costs, the possibility of employment displacement in the driving industry, and the requirement for strong regulatory frameworks to guarantee security and safety. It is anticipated that autonomous vehicles will improve lane management, acceleration, and deceleration, which could result in less gasoline being used. In a place like California where traffic congestion is a well-known issue, this is especially pertinent. When paired with electric cars (EVs), autonomous vehicles (AVs) have the potential to significantly lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, supporting California aggressive climate targets, which include becoming carbon neutral by 2045.

In comparison to ultrasound treatment alone (US), the sound pressure amplitude significantly increased from \u00b118 to \u00b130 kPa in US-ST, markedly reducing the cavitation nucleation threshold and augmenting the steady-state concentration of hydroxyl radicals (HO\u2022) by 13-fold. Further, with appropriate charge transfer conditions enabled by the acoustoelectric characteristics of the passive film on stirring paddles, the concentrations of superoxide (\u2022O2-) and singlet oxygen (1O2) elevated to 9.54 \u00d7 10-10 M and 8.43 \u00d7 10-13 M, respectively.

Ecological and hygienic assessment of the quality of drinking water at the centralized water supply of industrial cities of the Dnipropetrovsk region by the content of trace elements from the group of heavy metals. Object and research methods. The analysis of the content of trace elements from the group of heavy metals in the drinking water of industrial cities of the Dnipropetrovsk region - Dnipro, Kryvyi Rih, Kamianske over a 5-year period was carried out. The evaluation of the obtained data was carried out in accordance with the requirements of the current legislation on the safety and quality of drinking water in accordance with SSRN 2.2.4-171-10, international recommendations and data from the scientific literature. Results. It has been established that in the Dnipropetrovs'k region over the 5-year study period, the percentage of non-standard drinking water samples for sanitary and chemical parameters ranged from 24.4-30.6% from centralized water supply systems, and 14.5-18.4% from water supply networks. The average long-term concentrations of metals in the drinking water of the studied cities ranged from 0.0001 mg/l for mercury to 0.19 mg/l for aluminum, which meets the MAC requirements, but the maximum values of the content of individual metals in all industrial cities exceeded the hygienic regulations, most pronounced for iron, which reached 60%. At the same time, the proportion of samples exceeding the hygienic standard in some years of the study was 5-12%. In the dynamics of the study, a gradual decrease of 14.2-54.5% in the concentration of lead in drinking water in all industrial and control cities was noted (p<0.05; R2= 0.51-0.78). A similar trend is also characteristic of the aluminum content in drinking water in Kryvyi Rih - a 2.5-fold decrease (p<0.001; R2=0.79) during the study period. At the same time, a significant increase in the content of a number of trace elements from the group of biotic and abiotic heavy metals was found in Kamianske, in particular copper and zinc - by 2.0-2.4 times (p<0.01; R2= 0.72-0.77), mercury and arsenic - by 1.3-1.9 times (p<0.01; R2= 0.87-0.92). The dynamics of concentrations of other heavy metals in the drinking water of the studied cities was unreliable. The sum of the ratio of the concentrations of trace elements from the group of heavy metals belonging to hazard classes I and II according to the sanitary and toxicological limiting sign of harmfulness ranges from 1.1 to 1.9, i.e. the simultaneous presence of these metals in the drinking water of industrial cities exceeds the safe level regulated by SSRN 2.2.4-171-10.

The results of the conducted research indicate the urgency of the problem of ensuring the quality and safety of drinking water intended for human consumption and the need for further improvement of water treatment and control methods at all levels.

Persulfate (PS)-based advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are emerging as viable technologies to treat challenging industrial wastewaters or remediate groundwater impacted by hazardous wastes. While the generated reactive species can degrade a variety of priority organic contaminants through radical and nonradical pathways, there is a lack of systematic and in-depth comparison of these pathways for practical implementation in different treatment scenarios. Our comparative analysis of reaction rate constants for radical vs. nonradical species indicates that radical-based AOPs may achieve high removal efficiency of organic contaminants with relatively short contact time. Nonradical AOPs feature advantages with minimal water matrix interference for complex wastewater treatments. Nonradical species (e.g., singlet oxygen, high-valent metals, and surface activated PS) preferentially react with contaminants bearing electron-donating groups, allowing enhancement of degradation efficiency of known target contaminants.

Carbon emissions from this degradation total up to 0.2 petagrams of carbon per year (Pg C year\u22121), which is equivalent to, if not greater than, the emissions from Amazon deforestation (0.06 to 0.21 Pg C year\u22121). Amazon forest degradation can reduce dry-season evapotranspiration by up to 34% and cause as much biodiversity loss as deforestation in human-modified landscapes, generating uneven socioeconomic burdens, mainly to forest dwellers. Projections indicate that degradation will remain a dominant source of carbon emissions independent of deforestation rates. Policies to tackle degradation should be integrated with efforts to curb deforestation and complemented with innovative measures addressing the disturbances that degrade the Amazon forest. Description Losing the Amazon The Amazon rainforest is a biodiversity hotspot under threat from ongoing land conversion and climate change. Two Analytical Reviews in this issue synthesize data on forest loss and degradation in the Amazon basin, providing a clearer picture of its current status and future prospects. Albert et al. reviewed the drivers of change in the Amazon and show that anthropogenic changes are occurring much faster than naturally occurring environmental changes of the past. Although deforestation has been widely documented in the Amazon, degradation is also having major impacts on biodiversity and carbon storage. Lapola et al. synthesized the drivers and outcomes of Amazon forest degradation from timber extraction and habitat fragmentation, fires, and drought. \u2014BEL Two Reviews spotlight the threats of ongoing deforestation and degradation in the Amazon. BACKGROUND Most analyses of land-use and land-cover change in the Amazon forest have focused on the causes and effects of deforestation. However, anthropogenic disturbances cause degradation of the remaining Amazon forest and threaten their future. Among such disturbances, the most important are edge effects (due to deforestation and the resulting habitat fragmentation), timber extraction, fire, and extreme droughts that have been intensified by human-induced climate change. We synthesize knowledge on these disturbances that lead to Amazon forest degradation, including their causes and impacts, possible future extents, and some of the interventions required to curb them. ADVANCES Analysis of existing data on the extent of fire, edge effects, and timber extraction between 2001 and 2018 reveals that 0.36 \u00d7106 km2 (5.5%) of the Amazon forest is under some form of degradation, which corresponds to 112% of the total area deforested in that period. Adding data on extreme droughts increases the estimate of total degraded area to 2.5 \u00d7106 km2, or 38% of the remaining Amazonian forests. Estimated carbon loss from these forest disturbances ranges from 0.05 to 0.20 Pg C year\u22121 and is comparable to carbon loss from deforestation (0.06 to 0.21 Pg C year\u22121). Disturbances can bring about as much biodiversity loss as deforestation itself, and forests degraded by fire and timber extraction can have a 2 to 34% reduction in dry-season evapotranspiration. The underlying drivers of disturbances (e.g., agricultural expansion or demand for timber) generate material benefits for a restricted group of regional and global actors, whereas the burdens permeate across a broad range of scales and social groups ranging from nearby forest dwellers to urban residents of Andean countries. First-order 2050 projections indicate that the four main disturbances will remain a major threat and source of carbon fluxes to the atmosphere, independent of deforestation trajectories. OUTLOOK Whereas some disturbances such as edge effects can be tackled by curbing deforestation, others, like constraining the increase in extreme droughts, require additional measures, including global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Curbing degradation will also require engaging with the diverse set of actors that promote it, operationalizing effective monitoring of different disturbances, and refining policy frameworks such as REDD+. These will all be supported by rapid and multidisciplinary advances in our socioenvironmental understanding of tropical forest degradation, providing a robust platform on which to co-construct appropriate policies and programs to curb it.

These cyclical changes necessitate a high degree of adaptability among fish species, many of which have evolved specialized strategies to cope with the fluctuating conditions.

This study examines the effect of this extreme event on fish condition in white-water (Rio Solim\u00f5es basin) and black-water (Rio Negro basin) floodplain lakes. These contrasting environments provide a unique opportunity to study how different water qualities and extreme water-level fluctuations impact fish condition. Research was conducted during the normal low-water period in November 2019 and the drastically decreased water levels in November 2023. The main objective was to understand how extreme water-level fluctuations affect fish health and nutritional status. A total of 585 fishes were analyzed, with 294 from white-water and 291 from black-water, representing different feeding types to provide a comprehensive picture of changes in fish condition. Water-level changes had a statistically significant impact on fish condition in both areas. Comparing low-water and extreme low-water levels, fish condition was consistently higher during the normal low-water period. The linear mixed-effects model revealed that the intensity of the low-water season had a significant effect on fish length-adjusted mass, suggesting that the decrease in water level is associated with an overall decrease in fish length-adjusted mass. When comparing the mean water-level effect (Glass's \u0394) between low-water and extreme low-water levels, we found a bigger effect in the black-water system than in the white-water system.

These environmental shifts endanger the health and welfare of animals and the delicate balance between human populations, livestock, and wildlife. As the stewards of animal health, veterinarians are uniquely positioned to lead the change in addressing these complex challenges at the nexus of human, animal, and environmental health and well-being.

It underscores the critical need for veterinarians to embrace the One Health approach to tackle climate-driven disease outbreaks and the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance to safeguard human and animal populations while protecting natural ecosystems. The article further explores the role of veterinarians in fostering sustainable agricultural practices, reducing the environmental impact of livestock production, conserving biodiversity and advocating for policy reforms that protect both animal and planetary health. As we face an era of unprecedented climate disruption, this call to action aims to inspire the global veterinary community to actively get involved in combating climate change and its worst impacts.

In the critical redox system of mammalian cells, glutathione peroxidase (GPX) is the most prominent family of proteins with a multifaceted function that affects almost all cellular processes. A total of eight members of the GPX family are currently found, namely GPX1-GPX8. They have long been used as antioxidant enzymes to play an important role in combating oxidative stress and maintaining redox balance. However, each member of the GPX family has a different mechanism of action and site of action in maintaining redox balance. GPX1-4 and GPX6 use selenocysteine as the active center to catalyze the reduction of H2O2 or organic hydroperoxides to water or corresponding alcohols, thereby reducing their toxicity and maintaining redox balance. In addition to reducing H2O2 and small molecule hydroperoxides, GPX4 is also capable of reducing complex lipid compounds. It is the only enzyme in the GPX family that directly reduces and destroys lipid hydroperoxides. The active sites of GPX5 and GPX7-GPX8 do not contain selenium cysteine (Secys), but instead, have cysteine residues (Cys) as their active sites. GPX5 is mainly expressed in epididymal tissue and plays a role in protecting sperm from oxidative stress. Both enzymes, GPX7 and GPX8, are located in the endoplasmic reticulum and are necessary enzymes involved in the oxidative folding of endoplasmic reticulum proteins, and GPX8 also plays an important role in the regulation of Ca2+ in the endoplasmic reticulum.

Fruit waste contains different bioactive compounds like polyphenols, flavonoids, vitamins, and carotenoids, which are, in large part, underutilized regardless of their antioxidant properties. These compounds can play an important function in poultry nutrition, offering natural alternatives to synthetic antioxidants. Reintegrating fruit waste into poultry diets might have potent benefits on the nutritional quality and shelf life of eggs. Some studies reported that bioactive compounds from fruit waste improve the oxidative stability of eggs and the nutritional content, potentially extending shelf life during storage. Additionally, antioxidant compounds from fruit waste have been shown to improve yolk coloration and some egg quality parameters while reducing reactive oxygen species, which cause lipid oxidation. Their inclusion in poultry diets can lower feed costs, promote animal welfare, and reduce the environmental impact of fruit waste.

The results highlight that native vegetation is crucial for supporting endemic bird species, with 41% of all observed species found across all three habitat types and a significant 66.7% shared between native vegetation and edge habitats. In particular, insectivores and carnivores, key to biodiversity conservation and ecosystem service provision, showed higher abundances in areas with extensive native vegetation, underscoring its vital role in maintaining ecological functions. Edges not only enhanced the general bird richness and abundance but also served as crucial habitats for granivores and omnivores, influencing ecosystem dynamics through changes in the trophic guild community structure.

Studies have reported a diversity of trends, with some species strongly declining, others remaining stable and still others increasing. However, only a few species have been monitored annually for a long period of time by specific monitoring programmes. Instead, there are many heterogeneous datasets that contain observations of amphibians from professional surveys as well as diverse citizen science and other voluntary surveys. The use of these data brings a number of challenges, raising concerns about their validity and use in ecological research and conservation. We assessed to what extent such heterogeneous occurrence data can provide information on the status and trends of amphibians by contrasting different approaches to overcoming challenges with the data, using the German state of Saxony as an example. We assessed the effects of data processing decisions to infer absences, the use of survey method information and the statistical model (generalised linear mixed-effect occurrence model [GLMM] versus occupancy-detection model) and compared the trends with expert opinions (Red Lists). The different data processing decisions mainly led to similar annual occupancy estimates, newts being an exception. Annual occupancy estimates were typically less certain when attempting to account for the effects of survey methods, which could be explained by many missing values on methods. Separate models for drift fence data reduced the uncertainty in the annual occurrence probability estimates of the GLMM models, but uncertainty remained high for occupancy-detection models. For both methods, strong peaks and troughs in the annual occupancy estimates occurred for several species, which were not biologically plausible. Some peaks align with periods of lower sampling effort and were probably caused by shifts in the sampling locations or target species amongst years. Only for three species (Bufotes viridis, Hyla arborea and Pelophylax esculentus) were the trend results consistent amongst approaches and with expert opinions. For most other species, some inconsistencies appeared amongst models or approaches, indicating that trend assessments are sensitive to analytical choices. While heterogeneous data have proved useful for other taxa, our results highlight the complexity of using them for amphibians.

It was found that with moderate salinization, the seeds of both species successfully germinated, but the growth of shoots and the accumulation of aboveground biomass were inhibited, which was partly due to a slowdown in the rate of photosynthesis. With strong salinity, distinct interspecific differences were observed in the response of plants. In particular, the number of germinated seeds decreased in barley, while in wheat it remained at the control level. In barley, shoot growth was inhibited to a greater extent, whereas in wheat, the accumulation of aboveground biomass was. The content of pigments in barley plants decreased, and the content of wheat increased. At the same time, stomatal conductivity decreased in both species and the rate of photosynthesis slowed down. It is concluded that based on the energy of germination and germination of seeds, it is possible to determine the salt resistance of species only to a high level of salinity (200 mM NaCl). Morphometric indicators of shoot growth make it possible to assess the resistance of plants to salinity already at lower salt concentrations (100 mM NaCl).

This research involved a group receiving regular watering with half strength Hoagland\u2019s solution (HS), and other group watered with a modified form of the same solution containing 75 mM NaCl to stimulate salt stress. Seedlings were treated with foliar applications of Spd (0, 0.5, 1 mM) at five intervals: 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 d after sowing. Applying Spd significantly reduced damage caused by salt and protected essential pigments for photosynthesis (total chlorophyll by 33% and carotenoids by 57% over than the Spd-untreated plants under saline conditions). Additionally, 1 mM Spd enhanced the antioxidant enzyme activities, i.e., superoxide dismutase, catalase, and ascorbate peroxidase by 15%, 55% and 4.6% and promoted the buildup of beneficial compounds like proline, free amino acids and sugars. Remarkably, exogenous Spd application reduced Na + accumulation while improving K + content in common beans under salinity stress. Additionally, it enhanced the cell membrane stability index (CMSI) during stressful situations, the maximum CMSI (94.31%) was recorded with 1 mM Spd under non-stress conditions, whereas the minimum CMSI (72.97%) was registered under salinity without Spd. Under salinity condition, the real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) results demonstrated a significant increase in the expression of the vacuolar-localized Na + /H + antiporter protein (NHX1), and the multifunctional osmotic protection protein (Osmotin) in comparison to the control. Furthermore, common bean treated with Spd showed significantly higher expression levels of SOS1 , NHX1 , and Osmotin , under normal and salinity conditions, with the highest gene expression observed under 1 mM spermidine treatment under saline conditions.

Fortunately, phytoremediation, achieved through the use of plants and associated microbiomes, has shown great promise for tackling environmental pollution; this technology has been tested both in the laboratory and in the field. Plant\u2013microbe interactions further promote the efficacy of phytoremediation, with plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) often used to assist the remediation of organic pollutants.

This study explores the potential of double packaging, which employs easily separable layers, as a solution to enhance recycling efficiency and mitigate environmental impacts. Primary recycling methods, including mechanical and chemical processes, are examined alongside advanced techniques like solvent-based and enzymatic recycling.

Human exposure to HMs has increased dramatically due to the industrial activities of the 20th century. Mercury, arsenic lead, chrome, and cadmium have been the most prevalent HMs that have caused human toxicity. Poisonings can be acute or chronic following exposure via water, air, or food. The bioaccumulation of these HMs results in a variety of toxic effects on various tissues and organs. Comparing the mechanisms of action reveals that these metals induce toxicity via similar pathways, including the production of reactive oxygen species, the inactivation of enzymes, and oxidative stress. The conventional techniques employed for the elimination of HMs are deemed inadequate when the HM concentration is less than 100 mg/L. In addition, these methods exhibit certain limitations, including the production of secondary pollutants, a high demand for energy and chemicals, and reduced cost-effectiveness. As a result, the employment of microbial bioremediation for the purpose of HM detoxification has emerged as a viable solution, given that microorganisms, including fungi and bacteria, exhibit superior biosorption and bio-accumulation capabilities. This review deals with HM uptake and toxicity mechanisms associated with HMs, and will increase our knowledge on their toxic effects on the body organs, leading to better management of metal poisoning.

Yet its impacts on ecosystem services remain uncertain because pervasive interactions between grazing pressure, climate, soil properties, and biodiversity may occur but have never been addressed simultaneously. Using a standardized survey at 98 sites across six continents, we show that interactions between grazing pressure, climate, soil, and biodiversity are critical to explain the delivery of fundamental ecosystem services across drylands worldwide. Increasing grazing pressure reduced ecosystem service delivery in warmer and species-poor drylands, whereas positive effects of grazing were observed in colder and species-rich areas. Considering interactions between grazing and local abiotic and biotic factors is key for understanding the fate of dryland ecosystems under climate change and increasing human pressure. Description Complex effects of livestock Livestock grazing provides food and livelihoods for billions of people but at the cost of ecosystem degradation in many places. Maestre et al. investigated how grazing by livestock and native herbivores affects ecosystem functions and services and how these effects vary with climate, soil properties, and biodiversity (see the Perspective by Ganguli and O\u2019Rourke). Using a replicated survey at 98 dryland sites spanning six continents, the authors found that grazing effects on ecosystem services often depend on other factors.

Accumulated knowledge exists on the impact of each driver on community composition. Although previous studies have demonstrated changes in direct grazing impacts on ecosystem functions and community composition at different aridity levels, ranging from mesic to arid grasslands, whether a regional\u2010scale and continuous spatial pattern of plant compositional change along a gradient of aridity or edaphic variables is altered by grazing remains controversial. We compared the determinants and patterns of compositional changes with/without highly intensive grazing in the semi\u2010arid/arid regions of Mongolia. The compositional changes based on Bray\u2013Curtis dissimilarity were investigated using generalized dissimilarity modeling, including geographic distance, aridity, soil pH and soil texture as independent variables. Aridity consistently had a significant impact on community composition, regardless of the region and presence/absence of grazing. However, a difference in response patterns was observed between the regions. The compositional change was steeper at the upper (drier) limit of aridity than at the lower limit in the arid region. This pattern indicates the vulnerability of plant communities to aridity shifts owing to future climate change, especially in the desert steppe of Mongolia, although the predictions of shifts in aridity are not accurate. In addition, regardless of the region, the effects of soil pH on the community composition were eliminated by the presence of grazing. Grazing may homogenize community composition by not reflecting the spatial heterogeneity of soil pH or nutrient availability via selective herbivory.

To address this gap, we analysed temporal series of the normalized vegetation index (NDVI, a proxy of vegetation functioning) along a regional aridity\u2013disturbance gradient under current and future climatic conditions. We found that mean NDVI increases in areas of runoff water accumulation (calculated using a water redistribution index) until a certain threshold, above which vegetation patches are not able to retain extra runoff water.

The obtained results provided further evidence of the runoff water redistribution on vegetation, triggering a positive feedback between water accumulation and vegetation growth. Results obtained by the combination of the obtained model with climatic data from the 6th IPCC report suggest that this feedback could ameliorate the expected negative effects of aridification in drylands. However, this effect is partially counterbalanced in scenarios of high human disturbance and in areas where vegetation is not able to trap and retain the extra amount of resources given by runoff.

These include limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and effectively conserving and restoring functional ecosystems on 30 to 50% of land, freshwater, and ocean \u201cscapes.\u201d We envision a mosaic of interconnected protected and shared spaces, including intensively used spaces, to strengthen self-sustaining biodiversity, the capacity of people and nature to adapt to and mitigate climate change, and nature\u2019s contributions to people. Fostering interlinked human, ecosystem, and planetary health for a livable future urgently requires bold implementation of transformative policy interventions through interconnected institutions, governance, and social systems from local to global levels. Description Facing coupled environmental crises Humanity is facing major social and ecological impacts from climate change and biodiversity loss. These two crises are intertwined, with common causes and effects on one another. P\u00f6rtner et al. review the results of a joint meeting of members of the International Panels on Climate Change and Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services. They discuss the connections between biodiversity loss and climate change and propose potential solutions for addressing them as interconnected problems. Drastic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, protection of multiuse landscapes and seascapes, and policies for providing equitable access to natural resources can help to ensure future ecological function and human well-being. \u2014BEL A Review presents a guide to addressing climate change and biodiversity loss as nonindependent crises. BACKGROUND Two intertwined crises threaten human well-being: Climate change\u2014arising from human-induced greenhouse gas emissions, including those from the loss of biomass and biodiversity\u2014is raising temperatures beyond those of the Holocene, when human civilization evolved and expanded globally. Mean warming and the increasing frequency and severity of extreme events in turn disturb ecosystem functioning, cause habitat loss to humans and biodiversity, and exacerbate the unprecedented loss of biodiversity already caused by human-induced habitat degradation, overexploitation of natural resources, and pollution. Both crises reduce nature\u2019s contributions to people, which sustain well-being, livelihoods, economies, and development prospects and also support climate change adaptation and mitigation. Failing to act will increase human vulnerability, including poverty, food insecurity, involuntary displacement, and political instability and conflict. The coupled global climate and biodiversity crises and their societal impacts concern land, freshwater, and ocean ecosystems alike but are insufficiently tackled by current actions, as identified by assessments of both the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) and IPBES (Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services). None of the 20 2011\u20132020 Aichi biodiversity targets and none of the mileposts on climate trajectories intended to limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C have been met. ADVANCES Climate, biodiversity, and societal challenges are intertwined but are often treated as singular problems. Solutions exist with cobenefits across sectors. In intact and functional ecosystems, nature is efficient at carbon capture (by photosynthesis) and sequestration (long-term removal from the carbon cycle), provided that warming is limited to 1.5\u00b0C or below through ambitious emissions reductions. Strengthening the biosphere on land, in freshwater, and in the ocean will support climate change mitigation, adaptation, biodiversity, human well-being, and livelihoods. Mounting scientific evidence points to the need to prioritize protection of remaining undamaged carbon- and species-rich environments and to implement targeted restoration projects, with more attention to effectively sustaining biodiversity and fairly distributed societal cobenefits. Three critical objectives for future spatial planning include a habitable climate, self-sustaining biodiversity, and sustained provisioning of nature\u2019s contributions to people to support development and a good quality of life for all. Coordinated efforts among science and policy can identify and help navigate development pathways toward climate resilience for both human society and biodiversity. OUTLOOK New global biodiversity, climate, and sustainability targets envisioned for 2030 and 2050 will likely fail if drivers behind climate change and biodiversity loss remain insufficiently addressed or concrete actions to meet current political agreements and goals do not increase in pace and scale. The following actions are urgently needed. (i) Ambitious emissions reduction, combined with suitable adaptation measures. (ii) Effective protection of an average of 30 to 50% of surface areas across a mosaic of interspersed and interconnected land, ocean, and freshwater \u201cscapes.\u201d These cover a gradient, from pristine ecosystems; to spaces shared by humans and wild species and sustainably used; to spaces under intensive uses such as cities, which nonetheless can harbor substantial biodiversity in terrestrial and aquatic spaces. Efforts need to consider the specific spatial demands for healthy ecosystems. (iii) Building of development pathways and the underpinning of political, economic, and social institutions (including norms and rules) on visions such as collective responsibility, sustainable and circular uses of natural resources, avoidance of overconsumption and waste, and more equitable and participatory development regionally and globally. (iv) The enabling of just and equitable access to and benefits from natural assets across societies, groups, and individuals, securing good quality of life. Transformative action can overcome siloed approaches through institutional and individual change, achieving sustainability for nature and people, as well as human, ecosystem, and planetary health. Climate, biodiversity, and human society are coupled through dynamic interactions across scales. Human-caused exploitation and climate change are increasingly threatening biodiversity and nature\u2019s contributions to people, causing losses and damages exemplified through overfished stocks and excessive drought that harm productive habitats.

Logically, several of the discussed topics involve more than one of the mentioned main areas. Regarding food safety, the topics discussed are the use of analytical nanotechnology, nanometrology, nano-chromatography; the determination of organic contaminants based on MS and NMR; the impact of microplastics and nanoplastics on food or the contamination of foods with plant toxins. Regarding food authenticity, the paper discusses the role of MS, NMR, biosensors and the new trends in foodomics for food authentication. In terms of food processing, the work shows interesting perspectives on novel processing technologies, the effect of food processing on the gut microbiota or in the interaction among secondary metabolites and macromolecules; the development of active packaging, and the potential effects of introducing recycled plastics in food packaging; the new green extraction and encapsulation strategies of bioactive compounds from food by-products; and the anti-biofilm capacity of natural compounds/extracts/vegetal oils and essential oils. Food bioactivity and the relation between food and health includes the bioavailability and bioaccessibility of bioactive compounds; new trends and challenges in the interaction of nutraceuticals with biological systems; how food matrix impacts the bioaccessibility of nutrients and bioactive compounds; or the study of biodiversity, food and human health through one-health concept.

(2021) that green firms outperform brown firms when concerns about climate change increase unexpectedly, using data for S&P 500 companies from January 2010 to June 2018. To capture unexpected increases in climate change concerns, we construct a daily Media Climate Change Concerns index using news about climate change published by major U.S. newspapers and newswires. We find that on days with an unexpected increase in climate change concerns, the green firms\u2019 stock prices tend to increase, whereas brown firms\u2019 prices decrease. Furthermore, using topic modeling, we conclude that this effect holds for concerns about both transition and physical climate change risk. Finally, we decompose returns into cash flow and discount rate news components and find that an unexpected increase in climate change concerns is associated with an increase (decrease) in the discount rate of brown (green) firms.

The Hawasa dume variety, at 69 kg P ha-1, had the highest seed yield (2777.10 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>), whereas the Batu variety, without P application, had the lowest seed yield (1,718.73 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>). Additionally, correlation analysis demonstrated a positive and substantial relationship between seed yield and the majority of yield-related traits. The application of phosphorus fertilizer at 46 kg P ha<sup>-1</sup> resulted in the maximum net benefit (120,856 ETB ha<sup>-1</sup>) and MRR (1144.44 %) according to economic analysis. According to this study, applying phosphorus fertilizer may help promote high nodulation, yield, and growth of common beans. Thus, it can be said that for common production in the Yabello district, the application of phosphorus fertilizer at 46 kg Pha<sup>-1</sup> is advised. To get a final suggestion, it is advisable to repeat the experiment throughout several seasons and places, as it was only carried out for one season at a single location.\n", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-11-28", "synthetic_support_claim": "For common bean production in Yabello, 46 kg P ha^-1 is the recommended phosphorus fertilizer rate.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Common beans in the southern region of Oromia are unaffected by phosphorus fertilizer application rates."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "11c1e11d34858f780ee05ec6c2f60ff678f042f1", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/11c1e11d34858f780ee05ec6c2f60ff678f042f1", "title": "A combined model of shoot phosphorus uptake based on sparse data and active learning algorithm", "abstract": "The soil ecosystem has been severely damaged because of the increasingly severe environmental problems caused by excessive application of phosphorus (P) fertilizer, which seriously hinders soil fertility restoration and sustainable farmland development.

Achieving on-site measurement of large-scale data is difficult, and effective nondestructive prediction methods are lacking. Improving spatiotemporal SPU estimation at the regional scale still poses challenges. In this study, we proposed a combination prediction model based on some representative samples. Furthermore, using the experimental area of Henan Province, as an example, we explored the potential of the hyperspectral prediction of maize SPU at the canopy scale. The combination model comprises predicted P uptake by maize leaves, stems, and grains.

Even when the fishes still live, their consumption by humans may lead to the biomagnification of chemicals in the body system and can cause deadly diseases, such as cancer, kidney diseases, diabetes, liver dysfunction, eczema, neurological destruction, cardiovascular diseases, and so on. Equally, synthetic pesticides harm the soil texture, soil microbes, animals, and plants. The dangers associated with the use of synthetic pesticides have necessitated the need for alternative use of organic pesticides (biopesticides), which are cheaper, environment friendly, and sustainable. Biopesticides can be sourced from microbes (e.g., metabolites), plants (e.g., from their exudates, essential oil, and extracts from bark, root, and leaves), and nanoparticles of biological origin (e.g., silver and gold nanoparticles). Unlike synthetic pesticides, microbial pesticides are specific in action, can be easily sourced without the need for expensive chemicals, and are environmentally sustainable without residual effects. Phytopesticides have myriad of phytochemical compounds that make them exhibit various mechanisms of action, likewise, they are not associated with the release of greenhouse gases and are of lesser risks to human health compared to the available synthetic pesticides.

In this review we critically evaluate the epidemiological and biological evidence on the associations of these factors with PD and review evidence on whether these putative associations are causal.

Through genome association analysis of sorghum, a naturally high-alkaline\u2013tolerant crop, we detected a major locus, Alkaline Tolerance 1 (AT1), specifically related to alkaline-salinity sensitivity. An at1 allele with a carboxyl-terminal truncation increased sensitivity, whereas knockout of AT1 increased tolerance to alkalinity in sorghum, millet, rice, and maize. AT1 encodes an atypical G protein \u03b3 subunit that affects the phosphorylation of aquaporins to modulate the distribution of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).

Zhang et al. have now identified a locus in sorghum that determines sensitivity to salty alkaline soils. The Alkali Tolerance 1 (AT1) locus encodes a guanine nucleotide\u2013binding protein gamma subunit that regulates the phosphorylation of aquaporins, channels that can transport hydrogen peroxide to alleviate oxidative stress. Crops that could better manage growth on alkaline soils could open up agriculture to the millions of hectares of alkaline soils. \u2014PJH Regulation of phosphorylation on aquaporin underlies the ability of sorghum to tolerate alkaline soils. INTRODUCTION According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), there are currently >1 billion ha of land affected by salt. Among these, ~60% are classified as sodic soil areas. These have high pH and are dominated by sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) and sodium carbonate (Na2CO3). The effects of global warming and a lack of fresh water will lead to >50% of arable land becoming affected by salt by 2050, thus severely affecting the world\u2019s food security. Identifying and/or engineering sodic-tolerant crops is imperative to solve this challenge. Although salinity tolerance has been studied extensively, alkalinity tolerance in plants has not been studied in depth. RATIONALE Sorghum originates from Africa, where it can grow in harsh environments. As a result, sorghum has evolved greater tolerance to adapt to multiple abiotic stresses compared with other crops. Some sorghum varieties can survive in sodic soil with a pH as high as 10.0. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis was performed with a large sorghum association panel consisting of 352 representative sorghum accessions. We detected a major locus, Alkaline tolerance 1 (AT1), linked to alkaline tolerance. We found that AT1, encoding an atypical G protein \u03b3 subunit (a homolog to rice GS3), contributes to alkaline sensitivity by modulating the efflux of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) under environmental stress. RESULTS On the basis of the results of the GWAS analysis, we sequenced the cDNA regions of SbAT1 (Sorghum bicolor AT1) in 37 sorghum accessions with different degrees of alkaline sensitivity. Two typical haplotypes (Hap1 and Hap2) of SbAT1 were identified according to the five leading variant sites associated with sorghum alkali sensitivity. Hap1 encodes an intact SbAT1. A frame shift mutation (from \u201cG\u201d to \u201cGGTGGC\u201d) within Hap2 results in a premature stop codon probably encoding a truncated protein with only 136 amino acids at the N terminus (named Sbat1). To confirm the function of the AT1 locus, we generated a pair of near-isogenic lines (NILs) with two AT1 haplotypes to assess the allelic effect of AT1 on sorghum tolerance to alkali. We found that the Sbat1 allele (Hap2), encoding a truncated form of SbAT1, increased plant alkaline sensitivity compared with wild-type full-length SbAT1 (Hap1). Overexpression of AT1/GS3 reduced alkaline tolerance in sorghum and rice, and overexpression of the C-terminal truncated AT1/GS3 showed a more severe alkaline sensitive response. This was confirmed in millet and rice, which suggests that AT1/GS3 functions negatively in plant alkali tolerance. By contrast, knockout (ko) of AT1/GS3 increased tolerance to alkaline stress in sorghum, millet, rice, and maize, which indicates a conserved pathway in monocot crops. By immunoprecipitation in combination with mass spectrometry (IP-MS), we found that AT1/GS3 interacts with aquaporin PIP2s that are involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis. Genetic analysis showed that OsPIP2;1ko/2;2ko had lower alkaline tolerance than their wild-type control. The redox probe Cyto-roGFP2-Orp1 sensing H2O2 in the cytoplasm was applied. The results showed that, upon alkaline treatment, the relative H2O2 level increased in OsPIP2;1ko/2;2ko compared with wild-type plants. These results suggested that the phosphorylation of aquaporins could modulate the efflux of H2O2. G\u03b3 negatively regulates the phosphorylation of PIP2;1, leading to elevated ROS levels in plants under alkaline stress. To assess the application of the AT1/GS3 gene for crop production, field tests were carried out. We found that the nonfunctional mutant, either obtained from natural varieties or generated by gene editing in several monocots, including sorghum, millet, rice, and maize, can improve the field performance of crops in terms of biomass or grain production when cultivated on sodic lands. CONCLUSION We concluded that SbAT1 encodes an atypical G protein \u03b3 subunit and inhibits the phosphorylation of aquaporins that may be used as H2O2 exporters under alkaline stress. With this knowledge, genetically engineered crops with knockouts of AT1 homologs or use of natural nonfunctional alleles could greatly improve crop yield in sodic lands. This may contribute to maximizing the use of global sodic lands to ensure food security. Genetic modification of AT1 enhances alkaline stress tolerance. The G\u03b3 subunit, AT1, pairs with G\u03b2 to negatively modulate the phosphorylation level of PIP2 aquaporins. Thus, AT1 reduces the H2O2 export activity of PIP2s, leading to the overaccumulation of H2O2 and resulting in alkaline stress sensitivity. By contrast, the artificial or natural knockouts of AT1 homologs release the inhibition of PIP2s by AT1 in crops and have improved survival rates and yield under alkaline stress.

To begin with, three representative cultivars were selected from a population of 200 flax germplasm and assessed their physiological and transcriptomic responses to salt stress. The cultivar C121 exhibited superior osmoregulation, antioxidant capacity, and growth under salt stress compared to the other two cultivars.

Furthermore, genotyping of the 7,459 differentially expressed genes and correlating them with the phenotypic data on survival rates under salt stress allowed the identification of 17 salt-related candidate genes. Notably, the nucleotide diversity of nine of the candidate genes was significantly higher in the oil flax subgroup than in the fiber flax subgroup.

Rapid industrialization, emissions from automobiles, agricultural inputs, improper disposal of waste, etc., are the major causes of soil contamination with heavy metals. These contaminants not only contaminate soil but also groundwater, reducing agricultural land and hence food quality. These contaminants enter the food chain and have a severe effect on human health. It is important to remove these contaminants from the soil. Various economic and ecological strategies are required to restore the soils contaminated with heavy metals. Phytoremediation is an emerging technology that is non-invasive, cost-effective, and aesthetically pleasing. Many metal-binding proteins (MBPs) of the plants are significantly involved in the phytoremediation of heavy metals; the MBPs include metallothioneins; phytochelatins; metalloenzymes; metal-activated enzymes; and many metal storage proteins, carrier proteins, and channel proteins. Plants are genetically modified to enhance their phytoremediation capacity. In Arabidopsis, the expression of the mercuric ion-binding protein in Bacillus megaterium improves the metal accumulation capacity. The phytoremediation efficiency of plants is also enhanced when assisted with microorganisms, biochar, and/or chemicals. Removing heavy metals from agricultural land without challenging food security is almost impossible. As a result, crop selections with the ability to sequester heavy metals and provide food security are in high demand.

The efficiency of biochar addition in two rates (5 t/ha and 20 t/ha) to improve microbial properties and stabilize soil aggregates was also examined. Furthermore, the effect of irrigation with air-nanobubble-supplemented water was evaluated for the remediation of toxic metal spoils. The physiological condition of the plant species was investigated in terms of biomass, height, chlorophyll content, and antioxidant enzymes. The alkali and heavy metal accumulation and their distribution in the plant parts were assessed to explore whether toxic metals could accumulate in the root and further translocate to the aboveground tissues. The growth of T. smyrnensis was not adversely affected by its cultivation in lateritic spoil, and the highest rate of biochar exhibited a beneficial effect on plant growth in terms of weight (aerial and subterranean biomass). The highest biochar application rate led to significant increases in total chlorophyll content, showing a 97.6% increase when biochar is used alone and a 136% increase when combined with nanobubble irrigation. Remarkably, only when combining irrigation with air nanobubbles and low biochar supplementation did the translocation of the metals from soil to the aboveground tissues occur as the translocation factor was estimated to be greater than unity (TF > 1). The bioconcentration factors remained below 1.0 (BCF < 1) across all treatments, demonstrating limited mobilization from soil to plant tissues despite the application of soil amendments.

Water shortage and environmental sustainability are major problems, making wastewater treatment a responsibility. Customizing solutions for varied stakeholders and environmental conditions using standard methods is challenging. This study uses AquaMeld and Multi-Layer Perceptron with Recurrent Neural Network (MLP-RNN) algorithms to create a complete recommendation system. AquaMeld uses MLP-RNN to evaluate complicated wastewater, environmental, and pH data. AquaMeld analyses real-time data to recommend wastewater reuse systems. This design can adapt to changing scenarios and user demands, helping ideas grow. This technique does not assume data follows a distribution, which may reduce the model\u2019s predictive effectiveness. Instead, it forecasts aquatic quality using RNN-MLP. The main motivation is combining the two models into the MLP-RNN to improve prediction accuracy. RNN handles sequential data better, whereas MLP handles complex nonlinear relationships better. MLP-RNN projections are the most accurate. This shows how effectively the model handles complicated, time- and place-dependent water quality data. If other environmental data analysis projects have similar limits, MLP-RNN may work. AquaMeld has several benefits over traditional methods. The MLP-RNN architecture uses deep learning to assess complicated aquatic ecosystem interactions, enabling more proactive and accurate decision-making is the most accurate with a 98% success rate. AquaMeld is flexible and eco-friendly since it may be used for many agricultural and industrial operations. AquaMeld helps stakeholders make better, faster water resource management choices.

Traditional statistical and deep learning methods struggle to capture complex correlations in urban spatio-temporal data.

Collaborative learning to reconstruct data across multiple cities holds the promise of breaking this trade-off. Nevertheless, urban data's inherent irregularity and heterogeneity issues exacerbate challenges of knowledge sharing and collaboration across cities. To address these limitations, we propose a novel collaborative imputation paradigm leveraging meta-learned implicit neural representations (INRs).

By imposing embedding theory, we first employ continuous parameterization to handle irregularity and reconstruct the dynamical system.

Remote sensing data, including optical vegetation indices (VIs) like the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), are widely used to monitor vegetation dynamics due to their simplicity and high sensitivity. In contrast, radar-based VIs, such as the Polarimetric Radar Vegetation Index (PRVI), offer additional advantages, including all-weather imaging capabilities, a wider saturation range, and sensitivity to the vegetation structure information. This study introduces an enhanced form of the PRVI, termed the Normalized PRVI (NPRVI), which is calibrated to a 0 to 1 range, constraining the minimum value to reduce the background effects. The calibration and range factor were derived from statistical analysis of PRVI components across vegetated regions in the Contiguous United States (CONUS), using dual-polarization C-band Sentinel-1 and L-band ALOS-PALSAR data on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform.

Other enteric CH4 mitigation strategies are at earlier stages of research but rapidly developing. Herein, we discuss and analyze the current status of available enteric CH4 mitigation strategies with an emphasis on opportunities and barriers to their implementation in confined and partial grazing production systems, and in extensive and fully grazing production systems. For each enteric CH4 mitigation strategy, we discuss its effectiveness to decrease total CH4 emissions and emissions on a per animal product basis, safety issues, impacts on the emissions of other greenhouse gases, as well as other economic, regulatory, and societal aspects that are key to implementation. Most research has been conducted with confined animals, and considerably more research is needed to develop, adapt, and evaluate antimethanogenic strategies for grazing systems. In general, few options are currently available for extensive production systems without feed supplementation. Continuous research and development are needed to develop enteric CH4 mitigation strategies that are locally applicable. Information is needed to calculate carbon footprints of interventions on a regional basis to evaluate the impact of mitigation strategies on net greenhouse gas emissions. Economically affordable enteric CH4 mitigation solutions are urgently needed. Successful implementation of safe and effective antimethanogenic strategies will also require delivery mechanisms and adequate technical support for producers, as well as consumer involvement and acceptance. The most appropriate metrics should be used in quantifying the overall climate outcomes associated with mitigation of enteric CH4 emissions. A holistic approach is required, and buy-in is needed at all levels of the supply chain.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-10-01", "synthetic_support_claim": "Decreasing enteric methane emissions from ruminants is critical to limit global temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Investment in advanced genetic engineering of ruminal microbiota will significantly solve enteric methane emissions in ruminants."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "1153f7abc8d0d44783b000c134d8bc4fd6393439", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1153f7abc8d0d44783b000c134d8bc4fd6393439", "title": "Gallic and Ellagic Acids Differentially Affect Microbial Community Structures and Methane Emission When Using a Rumen Simulation Technique", "abstract": "Dietary tannins can affect rumen microbiota and enteric fermentation to mitigate methane emissions, although such effects have not yet been fully elucidated.

The accounting of on-farm enteric CH4 emissions and benefits from the use of AMFA starts with the ruminant animal (with estimates obtained from a range of approaches, from simple empirical emission factors or equations to complex process-based models) and goes all the way to national and supranational accounting. The choice of methodologies and levels of complexity to account for mitigation of enteric CH4 (or total GHG) emissions in livestock systems must be tailored to the scale of analysis aimed, the availability of input data to represent contextualized conditions, and the accounting objectives (e.g., academic exercise vs. producer's GHG certification vs. national GHG inventory). The accounting of enteric CH4 mitigating effects needs to consider the AMFA delivery methods and synergies and trade-offs of GHG emissions at levels before and beyond (upstream and downstream) the animal to fully assess the impact of AMFA use.

Evidence-based decision-making\nneeds to be informed by up-to-date and timely information on key indicators\nof the state of the climate system and of the human influence on the global\nclimate system. However, successive IPCC reports are published at intervals\nof 5\u201310 years, creating potential for an information gap between report\ncycles.

Existing studies on the association between temperatures and cardiovascular deaths have been limited in geographic zones and have generally considered associations with total cardiovascular deaths rather than cause-specific cardiovascular deaths. Methods: We used unified data collection protocols within the Multi-Country Multi-City Collaborative Network to assemble a database of daily counts of specific cardiovascular causes of death from 567 cities in 27 countries across 5 continents in overlapping periods ranging from 1979 to 2019. City-specific daily ambient temperatures were obtained from weather stations and climate reanalysis models. To investigate cardiovascular mortality associations with extreme hot and cold temperatures, we fit case-crossover models in each city and then used a mixed-effects meta-analytic framework to pool individual city estimates. Extreme temperature percentiles were compared with the minimum mortality temperature in each location. Excess deaths were calculated for a range of extreme temperature days. Results: The analyses included deaths from any cardiovascular cause (32\u2009154 \u2009935), ischemic heart disease (11\u2009745\u2009880), stroke (9\u2009351\u2009312), heart failure (3\u2009673\u2009723), and arrhythmia (670\u2009859). At extreme temperature percentiles, heat (99th percentile) and cold (1st percentile) were associated with higher risk of dying from any cardiovascular cause, ischemic heart disease, stroke, and heart failure as compared to the minimum mortality temperature, which is the temperature associated with least mortality.

Identifications were based on the relative size and orientation of the white eyepatch and the presence or absence of a dorsal cape. Type A (presumably the nominate form) has a medium-sized eyepatch oriented parallel to the body axis, no dorsal cape, it occurs mainly off-shore in ice-free water, has a circumpolar distribution and apparently preys mainly upon Antarctic minke whales (Balaenoptera bonaerensis). Type B also has an eyepatch oriented parallel to the body axis, but the eyepatch is at least twice as large as in Type A, it has a dorsal cape, mainly inhabits inshore waters, regularly occurs in pack-ice, is distributed around the continent and is regularly sighted in the Antarctic Peninsula area. Although it may also prey upon Antarctic minke whales and possibly humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), seals seem to be the most important prey item. Type C has a small, forward-slanted eyepatch, a dorsal cape, inhabits inshore waters and lives mainly in the pack-ice; it occurs mostly off East Antarctica, and to date it has been recorded feeding only on Antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus mawsoni). Type C appears to be referable to Orcinus glacialis as described by Berzin and Vladimirov (1983). Although similar ecological specialisations have been reported for sympatric killer whale populations in the Northeast Pacific (i.e. an inshore mammal-eater, an inshore fish-eater and an offshore form), the extent of morphological divergence, habitat segregation and, perhaps, reproductive isolation, appears to be more pronounced among Antarctic populations.

However, abiotic factors, e.g., drought, salinity, cold, heat, ultraviolet radiations (UVr), reactive oxygen species (ROS), trace metals (TM), and soil pH, are extremely destructive and decrease crop yield worldwide. It is expected that more than 50% of crop production losses are due to abiotic stresses. Moreover, these factors are responsible for physiological and biochemical changes in plants. The response of different plant species to such stresses is a complex phenomenon with individual features for several species. In addition, it has been shown that abiotic factors stimulate multi-gene responses by making modifications in the accumulation of the primary and secondary metabolites. Metabolomics is a promising way to interpret biotic and abiotic stress tolerance in plants. The study of metabolic profiling revealed different types of metabolites, e.g., amino acids, carbohydrates, phenols, polyamines, terpenes, etc, which are accumulated in plants. Among all, primary metabolites, such as amino acids, carbohydrates, lipids polyamines, and glycine betaine, are considered the major contributing factors that work as osmolytes and osmoprotectants for plants from various environmental stress factors. In contrast, plant-derived secondary metabolites, e.g., phenolics, terpenoids, and nitrogen-containing compounds (alkaloids), have no direct role in the growth and development of plants. Nevertheless, such metabolites could play a significant role as a defense by protecting plants from biotic factors such as herbivores, insects, and pathogens. In addition, they can enhance the resistance against abiotic factors. Therefore, metabolomics practices are becoming essential and influential in plants by identifying different phytochemicals that are part of the acclimation responses to various stimuli. Hence, an accurate metabolome analysis is important to understand the basics of stress physiology and biochemistry.

An increasing number of studies have focused on the ecological significance of secondary metabolites in plant parts, especially in pollen. Ericaceae species exhibit significant morphological variations and diverse colors, are widely distributed throughout China and are popular ornamental garden plants. The chemical trait of pollen in Ericaceae species and their potential ecological significance remain unclear. We selected a total of nine Ericaceae species from three nature reserves in southwestern China, which were the predominant flowering Ericaceae plants for each site, and measured their floral characteristics, nectar volume and sugar concentration. We determined the types of pollinators of these species based on a literature review and used UPLC-QTOF-MS to analyze the types and relative contents of primary metabolites (amino acids and fatty acids) and secondary metabolites (terpenoids, phenolics and nitrogenous compounds) in the pollen and other tissues, including the stems, leaves, petals and nectar. The results showed that each species exhibited unique floral characteristics. Enkianthus ruber, Pieris formosa, Rhododendron agastum, R. irroratum, R. virgatum and R. rubiginosum were pollinated by bees, and R. delavayi, R. decorum and R. excellens were pollinated by diverse animals (bees, birds and Lepidoptera). The pollen of these Ericaceae species was rich in phenolics and terpenoids, especially flavonoids. Grayanotoxin, andromedotoxin and asebotin (toxic diterpene compounds) were also detected in the pollen of some of the Ericaceae species in our study, and their response value was low. The relative contents and diversity of secondary metabolites in the pollen were higher than those in the nectar but lower than those in the leaves, petals and stems. The five chemical compounds with the highest content (four flavonoids, one triterpene) in the pollen were also detected in the stems, leaves and petals, and the response value of most of these chemicals in pollen was not significantly correlated with that in other tissues. Rhododendron species has a closer relationship with chemical traits in pollen compared with Enkianthus and Pieris species. The response value of total secondary metabolites in the pollen of species pollinated only by bees was higher than that of species pollinated by diverse animals.

The hydrothermal treatment of WLS in subcritical water with trace amounts of sulfuric acid was performed, followed by a two-step approach to evaluate the yields of hemicellulose and 5-HMF.

Zn has a significant role in the biochemistry and metabolism of plants owing to its significance and toxicity for biological systems at specific Zn concentrations, i.e., insufficient or harmful above the optimal range. It contributes to several cellular and physiological activities of plants and promotes plant growth, development, and yield. Zn is an important structural, enzymatic, and regulatory component of many proteins and enzymes. Consequently, it is essential to understand the interplay and chemistry of Zn in soil, its absorption, transport, and the response of plants to Zn deficiency, as well as to develop sustainable strategies for Zn deficiency in plants. Zn deficiency appears to be a widespread and prevalent issue in crops across the world, resulting in severe production losses that compromise nutritional quality. Considering this, enhancing Zn usage efficiency is the most effective strategy, which entails improving the architecture of the root system, absorption of Zn complexes by organic acids, and Zn uptake and translocation mechanisms in plants.

The 2-decade cumulative emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O were quantified at 198\u2009Tg, 557\u2009Gg, and 15.7\u2009Gg, respectively, amounting to 218\u2009Tg of CO2-eq (equivalent). Significant correlations were identified between GHG emissions and both straw yield and straw utilization (p<0.01). The enforcement of straw-burning bans since 2018 has played a pivotal role in curbing open straw burning and has reduced fire spots by 51.7\u2009% on an annual basis compared to 2013\u20132017.

Various climate-driven extremes, i.e., drought, heat waves, erratic and intense rainfall patterns, storms, floods, and emerging insect pests have adversely affected the livelihood of the farmers. Future climatic predictions showed a significant increase in temperature, and erratic rainfall with higher intensity while variability exists in climatic patterns for climate extremes prediction. For mid-century (2040\u20132069), it is projected that there will be a rise of 2.8\u00b0C in maximum temperature and a 2.2\u00b0C in minimum temperature in Pakistan. To respond to the adverse effects of climate change scenarios, there is a need to optimize the climate-smart and resilient agricultural practices and technology for sustainable productivity. Therefore, a case study was carried out to quantify climate change effects on rice and wheat crops and to develop adaptation strategies for the rice-wheat cropping system during the mid-century (2040\u20132069) as these two crops have significant contributions to food production. For the quantification of adverse impacts of climate change in farmer fields, a multidisciplinary approach consisted of five climate models (GCMs), two crop models (DSSAT and APSIM) and an economic model [Trade-off Analysis, Minimum Data Model Approach (TOAMD)] was used in this case study. DSSAT predicted that there would be a yield reduction of 15.2% in rice and 14.1% in wheat and APSIM showed that there would be a yield reduction of 17.2% in rice and 12% in wheat.

Such a production platform is an integrated intensified biorefinery (IIBR), used as an alternative to large-scale centralized production which relies on green electricity and CCUS. Hence, the capacity and availability of the renewable biomass and unavoidable waste were examined. The critical elements of the IIBR include gasification/syngas production; syngas cleaning; electricity generation; and the conversion of clean syngas (which contains H2, CO, CH4, CO2 and N2) to the primary products using nonthermal plasma catalytic reactors with in situ NH3 sequestration for SA fertilizers. The status of these critical elements is critically reviewed with regard to their techno-economics and suitability for industrial applications. Using novel gasifiers powered by a combination of CO2, H2O and O2-enhanced air as the oxidant, it is possible to obtain syngas with high H2 concentration suitable for NH3 synthesis. Gasifier performances for syngas generation and cleaning, electricity production and emissions are evaluated and compared with gasifiers at 50 kWe and 1\u20132 MWe scales. The catalyst and plasma catalytic reactor systems for NH3 production with or without in situ reactive sequestration are considered in detail. The performance of the catalysts in different plasma reactions is widely different. The high intensity power (HIP) processing of perovskite (barium titanate) and unary/binary spinel oxide catalysts (or their combination) performs best in several syntheses, including NH3 production, NOx from air and fertigation fertilizers from plasma-activated water. These catalysts can be represented as BaTi1\u2212vO3\u2212x{#}yNz (black, piezoelectric barium titanate, bp-{BTO}) and M(1)3\u2212jM(2)kO4\u2212m{#}nNr/SiO2 (unary (k = 0) or a binary (k > 0) silane-coated SiO2-supported spinel oxide catalyst, denoted as M/Si = X) where {#} infers oxygen vacancy. HIP processing in air causes oxygen vacancies, nitrogen substitution, the acquisition of piezoelectric state and porosity and chemical/morphological heterogeneity, all of which make the catalysts highly active. Their morphological evaluation indicates the generation of dust particles (leading to porogenesis), 2D-nano/micro plates and structured ribbons, leading to quantum effects under plasma catalytic synthesis, including the acquisition of high-energy particles from the plasma space to prevent product dissociation as a result of electron impact. M/Si = X (X > 1/2) and bp-{BTO} catalysts generate plasma under microwave irradiation (including pulsed microwave) and hence can be used in a packed bed mode in microwave plasma reactors with plasma on and within the pores of the catalyst. Such reactors are suitable for electric-powered small-scale industrial operations. When combined with the in situ reactive separation of NH3 in the so-called Multi-Reaction Zone Reactor using NH3 sequestration agents to create SA fertilizers, the techno-economics of the plasma catalytic synthesis of fertilizers become favorable due to the elimination of product separation costs and the quality of the SA fertilizers which act as an artificial root system. The SA fertilizers provide soil fertility, biodiversity, high yield, efficient water and nutrient use and carbon sequestration through mineralization. They can prevent environmental damage and help plants and crops to adapt to the emerging harsh environmental and climate conditions through the formation of artificial rhizosphere and rhizosheath.

Two distinct atomistic models of PA membranes are developed by controlling their degrees of cross-linking (DC). We then conducted a comparative analysis on their microscopic structural properties and configurations of water inside the membranes and investigated how these differences lead to different water diffusion coefficients. Our results reveal that the membrane with a lower DC exhibits higher polymer mobility and a more orderly microscopic structure, allowing the formation of pores that can hold larger water clusters as well as more transient passages between pores, both contributing to an increased water diffusion coefficient.

Renal function markers (serum creatinine and urea level), oxidative stress markers (superoxide dismutases, catalase, malondialdehyde), and histopathological investigations of the kidney were assessed to evaluate the effects. Cadmium administration resulted in significant renal dysfunction, characterized by elevated serum creatinine, urea, and kidney malondialdehyde levels, along with reduced antioxidant enzyme activities (superoxide dismutase and catalase). Histopathological evaluation showed extensive kidney damage characterized by renal tubular damage, necrosis, and inflammation.

Microalgae contain bioactive compounds that boost crop tolerance to environmental stresses, including salinity. Saline soils, characterized by elevated sodium chloride (NaCl) levels, negatively impact many crops, resulting in low productivity and high remediation costs. Therefore, this study evaluates the biostimulant properties of a microalgae-based commercial preparation (MR) on lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) plants grown hydroponically and exposed to saline stress. The extract was chemically characterized through elemental analysis, lipid composition (gas chromatography with flame ionization detector\u2014GC-FID), the determination of functional groups (Fourier Transformed Infrared\u2014FT-IR), structure (1H,13C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance\u2014NMR), with their hormone-like activity also assessed. Lettuce plants were treated with or without the microalgae blend, in combination with 0, 50 mM, or 100 mM NaCl. The contents of nutrients, soluble proteins, chlorophylls, and phenols, as well as the lipid peroxidation, antioxidants and root traits of lettuce plants, were estimated. The microalgae applied to salt-stressed plants resulted in a significant increase in biomass, protein, and chlorophyll contents. Additionally, significant effects on the secondary metabolism and mitigation of salinity stress were observed in terms of increased phenol content and the activity of antioxidant enzymes, as well as decreased lipid peroxidation. The potassium (K+) content was increased significantly in plants treated with 100 mM NaCl after addition of microalgae, while the content of sodium (Na+) was concurrently reduced.

The current RWA control strategies, including resistance breeding and the application of aphicides, are outpaced and potentially environmentally harmful. Alternatively, priming can stimulate defence responses to RWA infestation. This study investigated the priming potential of two priming agents, avirulent Puccinia triticina (Pt) isolates and salicylic acid (SA), against RWA infestation. The priming effect of Pt isolates and SA in reducing RWA-induced leaf damage and increased antioxidant activities is an indication of defence responses. Selected South African wheat cultivars and Lesotho landraces, grown under greenhouse conditions, were inoculated with Pt isolates (UVPt13: avirulent, UVPt26: virulent) and treated with SA at the seedling or booting stages. The leaf damage rating score was used for phenotyping. The antioxidant-mediated defence responses were evaluated in three selected cultivars for further priming investigation. Our results revealed that the priming agents significantly reduced the leaf damage in most cultivars at both growth stages, and UVPt13 and SA priming significantly (p \u2264 0.05) increased superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and ascorbate peroxidase activities. However, catalase activity exhibited a more pronounced decline in plants treated with the UVPt13 isolate. The Pt isolate priming was more efficient than the SA application.

It is now clear, however, that plastics are also responsible for significant harms to human health, the economy, and the earth\u2019s environment. These harms occur at every stage of the plastic life cycle, from extraction of the coal, oil, and gas that are its main feedstocks through to ultimate disposal into the environment. The extent of these harms not been systematically assessed, their magnitude not fully quantified, and their economic costs not comprehensively counted. Goals: The goals of this Minderoo-Monaco Commission on Plastics and Human Health are to comprehensively examine plastics\u2019 impacts across their life cycle on: (1) human health and well-being; (2) the global environment, especially the ocean; (3) the economy; and (4) vulnerable populations\u2014the poor, minorities, and the world\u2019s children. On the basis of this examination, the Commission offers science-based recommendations designed to support development of a Global Plastics Treaty, protect human health, and save lives. Report Structure: This Commission report contains seven Sections. Following an Introduction, Section 2 presents a narrative review of the processes involved in plastic production, use, and disposal and notes the hazards to human health and the environment associated with each of these stages. Section 3 describes plastics\u2019 impacts on the ocean and notes the potential for plastic in the ocean to enter the marine food web and result in human exposure. Section 4 details plastics\u2019 impacts on human health. Section 5 presents a first-order estimate of plastics\u2019 health-related economic costs. Section 6 examines the intersection between plastic, social inequity, and environmental injustice. Section 7 presents the Commission\u2019s findings and recommendations. Plastics: Plastics are complex, highly heterogeneous, synthetic chemical materials. Over 98% of plastics are produced from fossil carbon- coal, oil and gas. Plastics are comprised of a carbon-based polymer backbone and thousands of additional chemicals that are incorporated into polymers to convey specific properties such as color, flexibility, stability, water repellence, flame retardation, and ultraviolet resistance. Many of these added chemicals are highly toxic. They include carcinogens, neurotoxicants and endocrine disruptors such as phthalates, bisphenols, per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), brominated flame retardants, and organophosphate flame retardants. They are integral components of plastic and are responsible for many of plastics\u2019 harms to human health and the environment. Global plastic production has increased almost exponentially since World War II, and in this time more than 8,300 megatons (Mt) of plastic have been manufactured. Annual production volume has grown from under 2 Mt in 1950 to 460 Mt in 2019, a 230-fold increase, and is on track to triple by 2060. More than half of all plastic ever made has been produced since 2002. Single-use plastics account for 35\u201340% of current plastic production and represent the most rapidly growing segment of plastic manufacture. Explosive recent growth in plastics production reflects a deliberate pivot by the integrated multinational fossil-carbon corporations that produce coal, oil and gas and that also manufacture plastics. These corporations are reducing their production of fossil fuels and increasing plastics manufacture. The two principal factors responsible for this pivot are decreasing global demand for carbon-based fuels due to increases in \u2018green\u2019 energy, and massive expansion of oil and gas production due to fracking. Plastic manufacture is energy-intensive and contributes significantly to climate change. At present, plastic production is responsible for an estimated 3.7% of global greenhouse gas emissions, more than the contribution of Brazil. This fraction is projected to increase to 4.5% by 2060 if current trends continue unchecked. Plastic Life Cycle: The plastic life cycle has three phases: production, use, and disposal. In production, carbon feedstocks\u2014coal, gas, and oil\u2014are transformed through energy-intensive, catalytic processes into a vast array of products. Plastic use occurs in every aspect of modern life and results in widespread human exposure to the chemicals contained in plastic. Single-use plastics constitute the largest portion of current use, followed by synthetic fibers and construction. Plastic disposal is highly inefficient, with recovery and recycling rates below 10% globally. The result is that an estimated 22 Mt of plastic waste enters the environment each year, much of it single-use plastic and are added to the more than 6 gigatons of plastic waste that have accumulated since 1950. Strategies for disposal of plastic waste include controlled and uncontrolled landfilling, open burning, thermal conversion, and export. Vast quantities of plastic waste are exported each year from high-income to low-income countries, where it accumulates in landfills, pollutes air and water, degrades vital ecosystems, befouls beaches and estuaries, and harms human health\u2014environmental injustice on a global scale. Plastic-laden e-waste is particularly problematic. Environmental Findings: Plastics and plastic-associated chemicals are responsible for widespread pollution. They contaminate aquatic (marine and freshwater), terrestrial, and atmospheric environments globally. The ocean is the ultimate destination for much plastic, and plastics are found throughout the ocean, including coastal regions, the sea surface, the deep sea, and polar sea ice. Many plastics appear to resist breakdown in the ocean and could persist in the global environment for decades. Macro- and micro-plastic particles have been identified in hundreds of marine species in all major taxa, including species consumed by humans. Trophic transfer of microplastic particles and the chemicals within them has been demonstrated. Although microplastic particles themselves (>10 \u00b5m) appear not to undergo biomagnification, hydrophobic plastic-associated chemicals bioaccumulate in marine animals and biomagnify in marine food webs. The amounts and fates of smaller microplastic and nanoplastic particles (MNPs <10 \u00b5m) in aquatic environments are poorly understood, but the potential for harm is worrying given their mobility in biological systems. Adverse environmental impacts of plastic pollution occur at multiple levels from molecular and biochemical to population and ecosystem. MNP contamination of seafood results in direct, though not well quantified, human exposure to plastics and plastic-associated chemicals. Marine plastic pollution endangers the ocean ecosystems upon which all humanity depends for food, oxygen, livelihood, and well-being. Human Health Findings: Coal miners, oil workers and gas field workers who extract fossil carbon feedstocks for plastic production suffer increased mortality from traumatic injury, coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis, silicosis, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer. Plastic production workers are at increased risk of leukemia, lymphoma, hepatic angiosarcoma, brain cancer, breast cancer, mesothelioma, neurotoxic injury, and decreased fertility. Workers producing plastic textiles die of bladder cancer, lung cancer, mesothelioma, and interstitial lung disease at increased rates. Plastic recycling workers have increased rates of cardiovascular disease, toxic metal poisoning, neuropathy, and lung cancer. Residents of \u201cfenceline\u201d communities adjacent to plastic production and waste disposal sites experience increased risks of premature birth, low birth weight, asthma, childhood leukemia, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer. During use and also in disposal, plastics release toxic chemicals including additives and residual monomers into the environment and into people. National biomonitoring surveys in the USA document population-wide exposures to these chemicals. Plastic additives disrupt endocrine function and increase risk for premature births, neurodevelopmental disorders, male reproductive birth defects, infertility, obesity, cardiovascular disease, renal disease, and cancers. Chemical-laden MNPs formed through the environmental degradation of plastic waste can enter living organisms, including humans. Emerging, albeit still incomplete evidence indicates that MNPs may cause toxicity due to their physical and toxicological effects as well as by acting as vectors that transport toxic chemicals and bacterial pathogens into tissues and cells. Infants in the womb and young children are two populations at particularly high risk of plastic-related health effects. Because of the exquisite sensitivity of early development to hazardous chemicals and children\u2019s unique patterns of exposure, plastic-associated exposures are linked to increased risks of prematurity, stillbirth, low birth weight, birth defects of the reproductive organs, neurodevelopmental impairment, impaired lung growth, and childhood cancer. Early-life exposures to plastic-associated chemicals also increase the risk of multiple non-communicable diseases later in life. Economic Findings: Plastic\u2019s harms to human health result in significant economic costs. We estimate that in 2015 the health-related costs of plastic production exceeded $250 billion (2015 Int$) globally, and that in the USA alone the health costs of disease and disability caused by the plastic-associated chemicals PBDE, BPA and DEHP exceeded $920 billion (2015 Int$). Plastic production results in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions equivalent to 1.96 gigatons of carbon dioxide (CO2e) annually.

How do social networks tip? A popular theory is that a small minority can trigger population-wide social change. This aligns with the Pareto principle, a semi-quantitative law which suggests that, in many systems, 80\u2009% of effects arise from 20\u2009% of the causes. In the context of the transition to net-zero emissions, this vital 20\u2009% can be a critical instigator of social tipping, a process which can rapidly change social norms. In this work, we asked whether the Pareto effect can be observed in social systems by conducting a literature review, placing a focus on social norm diffusion and complex contagion via social networks. By analysing simulation and empirical results of social tipping events across disciplines and a large parametric space, we identified consistent patterns across studies and key factors which help or hinder social tipping. We show evidence supporting a tipping point near 25\u2009% of the total population within our compiled dataset. Near this critical mass, we observe a high likelihood for a social tipping event, where a large majority quickly adopts new norms. Our findings illustrate slight variations between modelling and empirical results, with average tipping points at 24\u2009% and 27\u2009%, respectively. Additionally, we show a range of critical masses where social tipping is possible; these values lie between 10\u2009% and 43\u2009%. These results indicate the potential, but not the inevitability, of rapid social change in certain susceptible populations and contexts. Finally, we provide practical guidance for facilitating difficult norm changes by (1)\u00a0leveraging trusted community structures and building critical mass in clustered networks (particularly in the 10\u2009%\u201343\u2009% threshold range), (2)\u00a0adapting strategies based on norm type and context, and (3)\u00a0targeting groups with moderate preferences and network positions \u2013 avoiding reliance on highly central or well-connected individuals \u2013 to enable endogenous spread.\n", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2025-01-28", "synthetic_support_claim": "We show evidence supporting a tipping point near 25% of the total population within our dataset.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "A minority of just 5% can consistently trigger population-wide social change through social networks."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "08afa9de4575e4d73efbe5c7fba2b07c1afeadfd", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/08afa9de4575e4d73efbe5c7fba2b07c1afeadfd", "title": "Unlocking Enhanced Capacitive Deionization of NaTi2(PO4)3/Carbon Materials by the Yolk-Shell Design.", "abstract": "The low salt adsorption capacities (SACs) of benchmark carbon materials (usually below 20 mg g-1) are one of the most challenging issues limiting further commercial development of capacitive deionization (CDI), an energetically favorable method for sustainable water desalination.

On the basis of company records, we quantitatively evaluated all available global warming projections documented by\u2014and in many cases modeled by\u2014Exxon and ExxonMobil Corp scientists between 1977 and 2003. We find that most of their projections accurately forecast warming that is consistent with subsequent observations. Their projections were also consistent with, and at least as skillful as, those of independent academic and government models. Exxon and ExxonMobil Corp also correctly rejected the prospect of a coming ice age, accurately predicted when human-caused global warming would first be detected, and reasonably estimated the \u201ccarbon budget\u201d for holding warming below 2\u00b0C. On each of these points, however, the company\u2019s public statements about climate science contradicted its own scientific data. Description Insider knowledge For decades, some members of the fossil fuel industry tried to convince the public that a causative link between fossil fuel use and climate warming could not be made because the models used to project warming were too uncertain. Supran et al. show that one of those fossil fuel companies, ExxonMobil, had their own internal models that projected warming trajectories consistent with those forecast by the independent academic and government models. What they understood about climate models thus contradicted what they led the public to believe. \u2014HJS ExxonMobil\u2019s own climate models showed that fossil fuel use would cause climate warming. BACKGROUND In 2015, investigative journalists discovered internal company memos indicating that Exxon oil company has known since the late 1970s that its fossil fuel products could lead to global warming with \u201cdramatic environmental effects before the year 2050.\u201d Additional documents then emerged showing that the US oil and gas industry\u2019s largest trade association had likewise known since at least the 1950s, as had the coal industry since at least the 1960s, and electric utilities, Total oil company, and GM and Ford motor companies since at least the 1970s. Scholars and journalists have analyzed the texts contained in these documents, providing qualitative accounts of fossil fuel interests\u2019 knowledge of climate science and its implications. In 2017, for instance, we demonstrated that Exxon\u2019s internal documents, as well as peer-reviewed studies published by Exxon and ExxonMobil Corp scientists, overwhelmingly acknowledged that climate change is real and human-caused. By contrast, the majority of Mobil and ExxonMobil Corp\u2019s public communications promoted doubt on the matter. ADVANCES Many of the uncovered fossil fuel industry documents include explicit projections of the amount of warming expected to occur over time in response to rising atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. Yet, these numerical and graphical data have received little attention. Indeed, no one has systematically reviewed climate modeling projections by any fossil fuel interest. What exactly did oil and gas companies know, and how accurate did their knowledge prove to be? Here, we address these questions by reporting and analyzing all known global warming projections documented by\u2014and in many cases modeled by\u2014Exxon and ExxonMobil Corp scientists between 1977 and 2003. Our results show that in private and academic circles since the late 1970s and early 1980s, ExxonMobil predicted global warming correctly and skillfully. Using established statistical techniques, we find that 63 to 83% of the climate projections reported by ExxonMobil scientists were accurate in predicting subsequent global warming. ExxonMobil\u2019s average projected warming was 0.20\u00b0 \u00b1 0.04\u00b0C per decade, which is, within uncertainty, the same as that of independent academic and government projections published between 1970 and 2007. The average \u201cskill score\u201d and level of uncertainty of ExxonMobil\u2019s climate models (67 to 75% and \u00b121%, respectively) were also similar to those of the independent models. Moreover, we show that ExxonMobil scientists correctly dismissed the possibility of a coming ice age in favor of a \u201ccarbon dioxide induced \u2018super-interglacial\u2019\u201d; accurately predicted that human-caused global warming would first be detectable in the year 2000 \u00b1 5; and reasonably estimated how much CO2 would lead to dangerous warming. OUTLOOK Today, dozens of cities, counties, and states are suing oil and gas companies for their \u201clongstanding internal scientific knowledge of the causes and consequences of climate change and public deception campaigns.\u201d The European Parliament and the US Congress have held hearings, US President Joe Biden has committed to holding fossil fuel companies accountable, and a grassroots social movement has arisen under the moniker #ExxonKnew. Our findings demonstrate that ExxonMobil didn\u2019t just know \u201csomething\u201d about global warming decades ago\u2014they knew as much as academic and government scientists knew. But whereas those scientists worked to communicate what they knew, ExxonMobil worked to deny it\u2014including overemphasizing uncertainties, denigrating climate models, mythologizing global cooling, feigning ignorance about the discernibility of human-caused warming, and staying silent about the possibility of stranded fossil fuel assets in a carbon-constrained world.

Plastic waste around active and former landfills remains a source of MPs. The landfill output consists of leachate and gases created by combined biological, chemical, and physical processes. Thus, small particles and/or fibers, including MPs, are transported to the surroundings by air and by leachate. In this study, a special focus was given to the potential for the migration and release of toxic substances as the aging of plastic debris leads to the release of harmful volatile organic compounds via oxidative photodegradation. MPs are generally seen as the key vehicles and accumulators of non-biodegradable pollutants. Because of their small size, MPs are quickly transported over long distances throughout their surroundings. With large specific surface areas, they have the ability to absorb pollutants, and plastic monomers and additives can be leached out of MPs; thus, they can act as both vectors and carriers of pollutants in the environment.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-10-01", "synthetic_support_claim": "Plastic debris aging leads to the release of harmful volatile organic compounds via oxidative photodegradation.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Microplastics from landfills significantly contribute to the bioaccumulation of toxins in marine food chains."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "21fbbebe608043533ad94441bad2cbeed8f85b66", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/21fbbebe608043533ad94441bad2cbeed8f85b66", "title": "Plastic waste characterisation to maximise landfill diversion from a New Zealand residential construction site", "abstract": "In New Zealand, the construction sector is responsible for a large proportion of waste sent to landfill. The plastic profile of construction waste is varied and complex in comparison to other waste types (e.g. timber, concrete, metals, plasterboard). Therefore, the diversion of plastics from landfills is less straightforward, and there are less obvious benefits to recycling this low-density, low-value waste stream. Plastic waste generated by construction activities has not been well-characterised, which has affected opportunities for waste reduction, reuse and recycling. To fill this knowledge gap, this study characterised the plastic waste generated from a residential construction site. This was used to identify opportunities to address the full waste hierarchy through reduction, reuse and recycling and ultimately enable more sustainable plastic waste management.Plastic waste generated from a construction site in Auckland, New Zealand (construction of eight terraced houses) was separated during the project into several categories (pipes, soft plastics, other plastics and hazardous waste). This was followed by in-depth auditing which further sorted waste types by main composition, followed by analysis for polymer type using fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The research was phased to determine the plastic waste generated across each of the main construction stages. Once the main polymer types had been identified, local waste providers were contacted to establish opportunities for reuse or recycling.The total mass of plastics generated from all construction stages was 725 kg, 66.4% (by wt.) of which was recycled. Soft plastics, predominantly low-density polyethylene, were the most common plastic type; this was followed by pipes and expanded polystyrene. Plastic packaging, primarily soft plastics and polystyrene, accounted for 60% of total plastics and were mostly generated in the final stages of construction (i.e. fittings and fit-out). This characterisation of construction plastic waste can be used to demonstrate the feasibility of sustainable plastic waste management in Auckland and to identify construction plastic waste sources on an international scale.

These issues are aggravated by the global rise in municipal solid waste (MSW) generation, surpassing the rate of population growth. Simultaneously, there is an urgent demand for sustainable energy solutions to combat climate change and its wide-ranging impacts. In response, this study addresses a critical question: is methanol production from MSW, a waste-to-chemical (WtC) alternative based on circular economy principles, a more environmentally sustainable approach compared to traditional waste-to-energy (WtE) methods like landfilling with biogas recovery and incineration? To answer this, this study evaluates the environmental performance of MSW-to-methanol technologies using life cycle assessment (LCA), focusing on key indicators such as global warming potential, resource depletion, and impacts on human health and ecosystem quality. The results reveal that methanol production from MSW significantly reduces global warming potential (GWP) by 87% compared to landfilling and 56% compared to incineration. Additionally, the process demonstrates high energy efficiency in electricity generation, achieving 80% of the output of incineration. These findings position MSW-to-methanol as a promising alternative for advancing sustainable waste management and renewable energy transitions.

This study aimed to assess the determinants of food security among internally displaced persons (IDPs)\u2014people who have been forced to flee their homes due to conflict, natural disasters, or other crises\u2014and their children under five, as well as the influence on their nutritional status. Using random sampling, the caregivers of IDPs and children under five in households were included in the study. The caregivers were interviewed using a validated structured questionnaire, while nutritional assessments of both children and adults were conducted through anthropometric and clinical evaluation methods. The findings revealed a high prevalence of food insecurity, with 97.6% of IDP households experiencing some degree of insecurity. Additionally, 28.3% of the surveyed households had high dietary diversity. Among the children, 50.6% were stunted, over a third were underweight, and 15.8% were wasted, indicating severe nutritional deficiencies. Among adults, 28.4% were overweight or obese, while a significant number were underweight. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the caregivers\u2019 monthly salary and the average amount spent on food were associated with a decrease in food insecurity. Conversely, large household sizes and coping strategies employed to mitigate food insecurity were linked to increased food insecurity. In conclusion, the study highlights a high prevalence of food insecurity among IDP households, forcing families to adopt coping strategies, mainly through dietary modifications. This, in turn, contributes to low dietary diversity and poor nutritional status, with children suffering from underweight, wasting, and stunting. These findings underscore the urgent need for comprehensive interventions, including the distribution of food vouchers, cash transfers, food banks, and support for home gardening and small-scale farming, as well as education on meal rationing, meal planning, and family planning services. Addressing the root causes of food insecurity\u2014namely low household income and large family sizes\u2014can improve access to nutritious food and ensure the health and well-being of IDPs. Furthermore, addressing food insecurity within this vulnerable group is critical to the broader goals of planetary health, as it highlights the intersection of human health, social equity, and environmental sustainability.

Plants have evolved several adaptive strategies to cope with drought. Stomata are essential structures for plants to control water status and photosynthesis rate. Stomatal closure is an efficient way for plants to reduce water loss and improve survivability under drought conditions. The opening and closure of stomata depend on the turgor pressure in guard cells. Three key signaling molecules, including abscisic acid (ABA), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and calcium ion (Ca2+), play pivotal roles in controlling stomatal closure. Plants sense the water-deficit signal mainly via leaves and roots. On the one hand, ABA is actively synthesized in root and leaf vascular tissues and transported to guard cells. On the other hand, the roots sense the water-deficit signal and synthesize CLAVATA3/EMBRYO-SURROUNDING REGION RELATED 25 (CLE25) peptide, which is transported to the guard cells to promote ABA synthesis. ABA is perceived by pyrabactin resistance (PYR)/PYR1-like (PYL)/regulatory components of ABA receptor (RCAR) receptors, which inactivate PP2C, resulting in activating the protein kinases SnRK2s. Many proteins regulating stomatal closure are activated by SnRK2s via protein phosphorylation. ABA-activated SnRK2s promote apoplastic ROS production outside of guard cells and transportation into the guard cells. The apoplastic H2O2 can be directly sensed by a receptor kinase, HYDROGEN PEROXIDE-INDUCED CA2+ INCREASES1 (HPCA1), which induces activation of Ca2+ channels in the cytomembrane of guard cells, and triggers an increase in Ca2+ in the cytoplasm of guard cells, resulting in stomatal closure. In this review, we focused on discussing the signaling transduction of ABA, ROS, and Ca2+ in controlling stomatal closure in response to drought. Many critical genes are identified to have a function in stomatal closure under drought conditions. The identified genes in the process can serve as candidate genes for genetic engineering to improve drought resistance in crops.

However, a multitude of scientific investigations now indicate that we are currently experiencing a phase known as the post-antibiotic era. There is a genuine concern that we might regress to a time before antibiotics and confront widespread outbreaks of severe epidemic diseases, particularly those caused by bacterial infections. These investigations have demonstrated that epidemics thrive under environmental stressors such as climate change, the depletion of natural resources, and detrimental human activities such as wars, conflicts, antibiotic overuse, and pollution. Moreover, bacteria possess a remarkable ability to adapt and mutate. Unfortunately, the current development of antibiotics is insufficient, and the future appears grim unless we abandon our current approach of generating synthetic antibiotics that rapidly lose their effectiveness against multidrug-resistant bacteria. Despite their vital role in modern medicine, medicinal plants have served as the primary source of curative drugs since ancient times. Numerous scientific reports published over the past three decades suggest that medicinal plants could serve as a promising alternative to ineffective antibiotics in combating infectious diseases. Over the past few years, phenolic compounds, alkaloids, saponins, and terpenoids have exhibited noteworthy antibacterial potential, primarily through membrane-disruption mechanisms, protein binding, interference with intermediary metabolism, anti-quorum sensing, and anti-biofilm activity.

This study used high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to analyze the bioactive components in a 70% ethanol extract of SLB.

Additionally, the effects of SLB on nitric oxide (NO) production and phagocytic activity were tested in RAW 264.7 cells. An acne skin model was established by treating HaCaT keratinocytes with heat-inactivated C. acnes.

Bacteria showed more sensitivity to variation in the karst tiankeng area and isolation than fungi.

Although the changes in topsoil microbial communities during restoration have been extensively studied, the structure, life strategies, and function of microbial communities in the subsoil remain poorly understood, especially regarding their role in nutrient cycling during vegetation restoration. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive investigation of the changes in the soil microbial community, assembly process, life strategies, and nutrient cycling functional genes in soil profiles (0-100 cm) across a 36 year chronosequence (5, 15, 28, and 36 years) of fenced grassland and one grazing grassland on the Loess Plateau of China. Our results revealed that soil organic carbon increased by 76.0% in topsoil and 91.6% in subsoil after 36 years of restoration. The bacterial communities were influenced primarily by soil depth, while the fungal communities were highly sensitive to the years of restoration. Microbes in the subsoil recovered faster, and the microbial community structure and functional genes in the soil profiles gradually became more consistent following restoration. In addition, we observed a transition in microbial life history strategies from a persistent K-strategy to a rapid r-strategy during restoration.

It is naturally found in soil (about 0.2 mg/kg), minerals, and water. Cd belongs to the group of toxic, carcinogenic, and stimulating elements. Its biological half-life in the human body ranges from 16 to even 30 years on average. Some lung diseases (such as emphysema, asthma, and bronchitis) and high blood pressure are thought to be related to slow poisoning. The symptoms of cadmium poisoning may vary depending on the time of exposure, the type of diet, and the age and health status of the exposed people. For non-smokers and non-occupational exposures, the only source of exposure is diet. The FAO/WHO recommends that the tolerable cadmium intake for an adult is approximately 0.4\u20130.5 mg/week (60\u201370 \u00b5g per day). Cadmium is primarily absorbed through the respiratory system (about 13\u201319% of Cd from the air), but it can also enter through the digestive system (about 10\u201344%), when dust is mixed and swallowed with saliva. The amount of accumulated Cd ranges from 0.14 to 3.2 ppm in muscles, 1.8 ppm in bones, and 0.0052 ppm in the blood.

The architecture utilizes a two-stage end-to-end framework that combines neural ordinary differential equation (NODE) models with vision transformers (ViTs). Initially, our approach models the underlying dynamics of complex systems within a low-dimensional space and then reconstructs the corresponding high-dimensional spatial fields. Traditional methods often involve decoding high-dimensional spatial fields before modeling the dynamics, while others use an encoder to transition from high-dimensional observations to a latent space for dynamic modeling. In contrast, our approach directly uses sparse measurements to model the dynamics, bypassing the need for an encoder. This direct approach simplifies the modeling process, reduces computational complexity, and enhances the efficiency and scalability of the method for large datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through applications to various spatio-temporal systems, including fluid flows and global weather patterns. Although sparse measurements have limitations, our experiments reveal that they are sufficient to accurately forecast system dynamics over long time horizons. Furthermore, our results indicate that the performance of the proposed method remains robust across different sensor placement strategies, with further improvements as the number of sensors increases.

One key aspect of Data assimilation is the analysis step, where the output of the numerical model is adjusted in order to account for the observational data. In Variational Data Assimilation and under Gaussian assumptions, the analysis step comes down to solving a high-dimensional non-linear least-square problem. In practice, this minimization involves successive inversions of large, and possibly ill-conditioned matrices constructed using linearizations of the forward model. In order to improve the convergence rate of these methods, and thus reduce the computational burden, preconditioning techniques are often used to get better-conditioned matrices, but require either the sparsity pattern of the matrix to inverse, or some spectral information.

For accurate and efficient LULC classification, high-quality datasets and robust classification methods are required. With the increasing availability of satellite data, geospatial analysis tools, and classification methods, it is essential to systematically assess the performance of different combinations of satellite data and classification methods to help select the best approach for LULC classification. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the LULC classification performance of two commonly used platforms (i.e., ArcGIS Pro and Google Earth Engine) with different satellite datasets (i.e., Landsat, Sentinel, and Planet) through a case study for the city of Charlottetown in Canada. Specifically, three classifiers in ArcGIS Pro, including support vector machine (SVM), maximum likelihood (ML), and random forest/random tree (RF/RT), are utilized to develop LULC maps over the period of 2017\u20132021. Whereas four classifiers in Google Earth Engine, including SVM, RF/RT, minimum distance (MD), and classification and regression tree (CART), are used to develop LULC maps for the same period. To identify the most efficient and accurate classifier, the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient for each classifier is calculated throughout the study period for all combinations of satellite data, classification platforms, and methods. Change detection is then conducted using the best classifier to quantify the LULC changes over the study period. Results show that the SVM classifier in both ArcGIS Pro and Google Earth Engine presents the best performance compared to other classifiers. In particular, the SVM in ArcGIS Pro shows an overall accuracy of 89% with Landsat, 91% with Sentinel, and 94% with Planet. Similarly, in Google Earth Engine, the SVM shows an accuracy of 87% with Landsat 8 and 92% with Sentinel 2.

While long-term effects of water level variations have been extensively studied, short-term impacts on Siberian crane habitats and their ecological vulnerability remain poorly understood. This study utilized 35 years (1987\u20132022) of Landsat remote sensing data and daily water level records from Poyang Lake to examine the effects of short-term water level fluctuations on the spatial distribution and ecological vulnerability of Siberian crane habitats. The geographic detector method was employed to quantify the explanatory power and interaction effects of factors, including short-term water level fluctuations, on ecological vulnerability. The findings reveal significant differences in the habitats of wintering Siberian cranes across various water level intervals and short-term fluctuation patterns. Short-term water level fluctuations can result in the largest suitable wintering habitat area for Siberian cranes, reaching 1856.41 km2 in this study. These habitats are highly sensitive to short-term water level changes, with rising and falling trends potentially leading to habitat loss. Oscillating water levels in the short term create broader and more concentrated habitats. Notably, fluctuations at low water levels support the sustainability and stability of crane habitats. Furthermore, short-term water level trends and nature reserves play a critical role in maintaining habitat ecological vulnerability; well-managed and protected nature reserves exhibit significant explanatory power, both in single-factor analysis and in their interaction with other environmental factors. Specifically, these protected areas show explanatory power exceeding the 20% threshold for both water level fluctuations and ranges, highlighting the crucial role of anthropogenic management in mitigating ecological vulnerability.

This discrepancy can lead to inaccurate model outputs and misinformed management decisions. This study addresses this challenge by developing a novel monthly data adjustment approach, the Runoff Curve Year\u2013Type\u2013Monthly (RC-YTM) method. The application of this method is exemplified at five key California watersheds. The RC-YTM method accounts for the increasing variability and shifts in seasonal runoff timing observed in the historical data (1922\u20132021), aligning it with the contemporary climate conditions represented by the period from 1992 to 2021 at the study watersheds. This method adjusts both annual and monthly streamflow values using a combination of precipitation\u2013runoff relationships, quantile mapping, and water year classification.

Boreal fire regimes are intensifying because of climate change, and the northern parts of boreal forests are underlain by permafrost. Boreal fires combust vegetation and organic soils, which insulate permafrost, and as such deepen the seasonally thawed active layer and can lead to further carbon emissions to the atmosphere. Current understanding of the environmental drivers of post-fire thaw depth is limited but of critical importance. In addition, mapping thaw depth over fire scars may enable a better understanding of the spatial variability in post-fire responses of permafrost soils. We assessed the environmental drivers of post-fire thaw depth using field data from a fire scar in a larch-dominated forest in the continuous permafrost zone in eastern Siberia. Particularly, summer thaw depth was deeper in burned (mean=127.3\u2009cm, standard deviation (SD)\u2009=\u200927.7\u2009cm) than in unburned (98.1\u2009cm, SD=26.9\u2009cm) landscapes 1\u00a0year after the fire, yet the effect of fire was modulated by landscape and vegetation characteristics. We found deeper thaw in well-drained upland, in open and mature larch forest often intermixed with Scots pine, and in high-severity burns. The environmental drivers basal area, vegetation density, and burn depth explained 73.3\u2009% of the measured thaw depth variability at the study sites. In addition, we evaluated the relationships between field-measured thaw depth and several remote sensing proxies. Albedo, the differenced normalized burn ratio (dNBR), and the pre-fire normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from Landsat 8 imagery together explained 66.3\u2009% of the variability in field-measured thaw depth. Moreover, land surface temperature (LST) displayed particularly strong correlations with post-fire thaw depth (r=0.65, p<0.01). Based on these remote sensing proxies and multiple linear regression analysis, we estimated thaw depth over the entire fire scar. Our study reveals some of the governing processes of post-fire thaw depth development and shows the capability of Landsat imagery to estimate post-fire thaw depth at a landscape scale.\n", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-11-20", "synthetic_support_claim": "Summer thaw depth was deeper in burned landscapes than in unburned landscapes 1 year after the fire.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Boreal fires significantly reduce the overall carbon sequestration capacity of boreal forests over the long term."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "727c531432cf1ea7f0fde4b3db3818a163d6882b", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/727c531432cf1ea7f0fde4b3db3818a163d6882b", "title": "Impact of Siberian Wildfires on Ice-Nucleating Particle Concentrations over the Northwestern Pacific", "abstract": "Ice-nucleating particles (INPs) significantly influence aerosol\u2013cloud precipitation interactions at regional and global scales.

However, the contradiction between resistance to salinity accretion and maintaining high water evaporation properties remains a challenging bottleneck. Herein, we have developed a biomimetic multiscale-ordered hydrogel-based solar water evaporator for efficient seawater desalination. The as-prepared solar water evaporator consists of highly ordered ultralong hydroxyapatite (HAP) nanowires as a supporting backbone and heat insulator, MXene as a sunlight absorber, and hydrophilic hyaluronic acid methacryloyl (HAMA) as an interfacial bonding agent, and a modifier to reduce the water evaporation enthalpy. The MXene/ultralong HAP nanowires/HAMA (MHH) photothermal hydrogel evaporator with the multiscale-ordered hierarchical structure mimics the fish-gill structure. The highly ordered alignment of ultralong HAP nanowires is realized at multiple scales, from the nanoscale to the microscale to the macroscale and from 1D to 2D to 3D in the as-prepared photothermal hydrogel evaporator. The high-performance MHH photothermal hydrogel water evaporator exhibits high efficiency of photothermal conversion, low water evaporation enthalpy, excellent heat management capability, and high solar water evaporation performance. The water evaporation enthalpy decreases from 2431 J g-1 (pure water) to 1113 J g-1 using the MHH photothermal hydrogel evaporator. As a result, the high-performance MHH hydrogel water evaporator can realize a high water evaporation rate of 6.278 kg m-2 h-1 under one sun illumination (1 kW m-2). Moreover, the as-prepared MHH hydrogel evaporator is able to achieve a water evaporation rate of 4.931 kg m-2 h-1 using the real seawater sample, exhibiting excellent salt-rejecting performance.

It is widely recognized but poorly understood for its underlying causes. This study investigates the potential of astringent seeds to alleviate the toxic effects of active aluminum ions. Methods This study involved treating seeds and seedlings with two distinct concentrations of astringent seeds water extracts under the aluminum ion stress. Then the germination of seeds and growth of seedlings were evaluated and compared. Results Under aluminum stress, both seed germination and seedling growth were notably inhibited. Treatment with a low-concentration of the extract significantly alleviated this inhibition. Root elongation in the seedlings increased by 36.95% compared to the control group, and the aluminum ion accumulation at the root tips was reduced by 38.89% relative to the aluminum-stressed group. This treatment also normalized the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) in the roots and leaves, enhanced the activities of antioxidative enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), and restored the levels of endogenous hormones including gibberellin (GA3), indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), methyl jasmonate (Ja-ME), and abscisic acid (ABA). Furthermore, the low-concentration of the extract positively impacted the disorganized chloroplast structures.

Among the different stresses, extreme temperatures (heat and cold) disturb plant growth and development, reduces productivity, and in severe cases, leads to plant death. The plants have developed numerous strategies to safeguard themselves against the detrimental impact of temperature stress. Exposure to stress evokes the accumulation of various metabolites like sugars, sugar alcohols, organic acids, and amino acids. Plants accumulate the amino acid proline (Pro) in response to several abiotic stresses, including temperature stress. Proline abundance may result from de novo synthesis, hydrolysis of proteins, and reduced utilization or degradation. Pro also imparts stress tolerance by maintaining the osmotic balance (still controversial), cell turgidity, and indirectly modulating the metabolism of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, the crosstalk of Pro with other osmoprotectants and signaling molecules like glycine betaine, abscisic acid, nitric oxide, hydrogen sulfide, soluble sugars, etc., helps in strengthening the protective mechanism under stressful environments. The development of temperature-smart cultivars can be achieved by manipulating the biosynthesis of Pro through genetic engineering. Therefore, this review presented an overview of plant responses to extreme temperatures and an outline of the Pro metabolism under extreme temperatures. The exogenous application of Pro as a \"shield molecule\" under extreme temperatures is also presented. Proline crosstalk and interaction with other molecules have also been discussed.

This study investigated the effects of varying light intensities (150 and 250 photosynthetic photon flux densities) and salinity levels (<1.5, 5, 10, and 17 parts per thousand, equivalent to <26, 86, 171, and 291 millimolars) on the growth and nutrient composition of Russian kale (Brassica oleracea) grown in indoor hydroponics.

The results revealed that a light intensity of 250 PPFD and salinity levels of <1.5\u20135 ppt (<26\u201386 mM) were optimal for maximizing the biomass yield of the kale, whereas a significant reduction in the yield was observed at salinity levels exceeding 10 ppt (171 mM). In contrast, the dry matter percentage was significantly higher at 17 ppt (291 mM). The macronutrient contents, particularly the total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), total phosphorus (TP), and magnesium (Mg), were consistent across both light intensities (150\u2013250 PPFDs) and at salinity levels between <1.5 and 10 ppt (<26\u2013171 mM) but were reduced at 17 ppt (291 mM). The micronutrient concentrations, such as those of copper (Cu), iron (Fe), and zinc (Zn), were higher at the lower light intensity (150 PPFD) across the salinity levels.

Drawing inspiration from the multilevel heterogeneous structures in biological tissues, an antiswelling hydrogel sensor endowed with high strength, rapid self-recovery, and low swelling ratio was fabricated through a water-induced phase separation and coordination cross-linking strategy. A dense heterogeneous architecture was developed by the integration of \"rigid\" quadridentate carboxyl-Zr4+ coordination bonds and \"soft\" hydrophobic unit-rich regions featuring \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking and cation-\u03c0 interactions into the hydrogels. This unique structural design facilitated the progressive breaking of cross-links within the hydrogel network from \"soft\" to \"rigid\" under external loads, effectively dissipating energy and thereby imparting the hydrogels with exceptional mechanical characteristics, evidenced by a strength of 1.42 MPa, and complete self-recovery within 3 min. Simultaneously, the \"rigid\" and \"soft\" dynamic interactions synergistically conferred augmented elastic retractive forces on the hydrogel network by enhancing cross-linking density, thereby providing the hydrogels with prominent antiswelling capabilities in water (with a swelling ratio of only -2.49%), in solutions with diverse pH (1-9), and in seawater. Moreover, the hydrogels manifested favorable strain-sensitivity (gauge factor up to 2.45) and frequency response by virtue of the collaborative contribution of dynamic ions (Cl- and Zr4+).

This study aims to reduce the impact of wastewater pollution by removing amoxicillin (AMO) antibiotics as an organic pollutant. In this concept, two synthesized catalysts, NiAl2O4 and ZnO, are sensitive oxides to light energy. The prepared materials were then characterized using X-ray diffraction, UV\u2013vis solid reflectance diffuse, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, BET, and ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. The effects of principal operating parameters under sunlight, namely, the percentage of the mixture of NiAl2O4 and ZnO, the pH of the medium, and the initial concentration of the antibiotic were studied experimentally to determine the optimal conditions for achieving a high degradation rate. The results showed that photodegradation is higher at a pH of 6, with a weight percentage of the mixture of 50% for both catalysts in 1 g/L of the total catalyst dose. Then, the effect of the initial concentration of AMO on the photodegradation reaction showed an important influence on the photodegradation process; as the degradation rate decreases, the initial AMO concentration increases. A high degradation rate of 92% was obtained for an initial AMO concentration of 10 mg/L and a pH of 6. The kinetic study of degradation established that the first-order model and the Langmuir\u2013Hinshelwood (LH) mechanism fit the experimental data perfectly. The study showed the success of using heterosystem photocatalysts and sustainable energy for effective pharmaceutical removal, which can be extended to treat wastewater with other organic emerging pollutants. On the other hand, modeling was introduced using Gaussian process regression (GPR) to predict the degradation rate of AMO under sunlight in the presence of heterogeneous ZnO and NiAl2O4 systems. The model evaluation criteria of GPR in terms of statistical coefficients and errors show very interesting results and the performance of the model used. Where statistical coefficients were close to one (R = 0.9981), statistical errors were very small (RMSE = 0.1943 and MAE = 0.0518).

The results indicate that increased plant diversity reduces ARGs and MGEs abundance by 19.2%-51.2%, whereas plant species exhibit inconsistent and soil-dependent effects. Potential bacterial hosts harboring abundant ARGs have greater relative abundance than nonhosts, and both their richness and cumulative relative abundance are reduced by plant diversity.

The enriched compounds in root exudates due to plant diversity play a more important role in the metabolic network and contribute to rebalancing of the abundance of potential hosts and nonhosts. An independent test using pure organics reveals that higher resource diversity, resulting from increased plant diversity, reduces the relative abundance and mobility of abundant and high-risk ARGs.

Here, we reviewed the accuracy and efficiency of the three primary global soil carbon assessment methods, including statistical models, process-based models, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) steady-state method.

Additionally, the IPCC Tier 2 method cannot be directly applied to estimate SOC in multi-cropping systems due to mismatches in parameters and time steps. We suggest modifying the structures and parameters of the IPCC Tier 2 method by revising the inventory unit and redetermining the parameter values, which should efficiently address its bottleneck in estimating SOC for multi-cropping systems.

They often promote an increase in inflammatory activities in the airways that manifest themselves as chronic diseases (e.g., allergic airway diseases, asthma, chronic bronchitis/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or even lung cancer). Increased levels of oxidative stress (OS) reduce the antioxidant defenses, affect the autophagy/mitophagy processes, and the regulatory mechanisms of cell survival, promoting inflammation in the lung. In fact, OS potentiate the inflammatory activities in the lung, favoring the progression of chronic airway diseases. OS increases the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), including superoxide anions (O2\u2212), hydroxyl radicals (OH) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), by the transformation of oxygen through enzymatic and non-enzymatic reactions. In this manner, OS reduces endogenous antioxidant defenses in both nucleated and non-nucleated cells. The production of ROS in the lung can derive from both exogenous insults (cigarette smoke or environmental pollution) and endogenous sources such as cell injury and/or activated inflammatory and structural cells.

Abstract Background: The relationship between obesity and respiratory diseases has been widely explored. In this context, the Weight-Adjusted Waist Index (WWI) has emerged as a novel metric for assessing visceral fat. This study aims to evaluate the association between WWI and the risk of emphysema in the U.S. population, by utilizing data from the 2001\u20132018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).

Interaction and subgroup analyses were performed to explore effect modifiers. Results: Our study included a total of 44,949 American adults. The results of the multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed an association between WWI and the incidence of emphysema.

As the aging population grows, the rising number of elderly surgical patients has made PND an urgent clinical challenge. Despite increasing research efforts, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying PND remain inadequately characterized, underscoring the need for a more integrated framework to guide targeted interventions. To better understand the molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets of PND, this narrative review synthesized evidence from peer-reviewed studies, identified through comprehensive searches of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science. Key findings highlight neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, neurotransmitter imbalances, microvascular changes, and white matter lesions as central to PND pathophysiology, with particular parallels to encephalocele- and sepsis-associated cognitive impairments. Among these, neuroinflammation, mediated by pathways such as the NLRP3 inflammasome and blood\u2013brain barrier disruption, emerges as a pivotal driver, triggering cascades that exacerbate neuronal injury. Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction synergistically amplify these effects, while neurotransmitter imbalances and microvascular alterations, including white matter lesions, contribute to synaptic dysfunction and cognitive decline. Anesthetic agents modulate these interconnected pathways, exhibiting both protective and detrimental effects. Propofol and dexmedetomidine demonstrate neuroprotective properties by suppressing neuroinflammation and microglial activation, whereas inhalational anesthetics like sevoflurane intensify oxidative stress and inflammatory responses. Ketamine, with its anti-inflammatory potential, offers promise but requires further evaluation to determine its long-term safety and efficacy.

The results show that the global average recovery time is approximately 3.3\u2009months, and that the longest recovery time occurs in mid\u2010latitude drylands. Analysis of affecting factors of recovery time suggests that the most important environmental factor affecting recovery time is soil moisture during the recovery period, followed by temperature and vapour pressure deficit (VPD). Recovery time shortens with increasing soil moisture and prolongs with increasing VPD; however, the response of recovery time to temperature is nonmonotonic, with colder or hotter temperatures leading to longer recovery time. Soil moisture dominates the drought recovery time over 58.4% of the assessed land area, mostly in the mid\u2010latitudes. The concern is that soil moisture is projected to decline in more than 65% regions in the future, which will lengthen the drought recovery time and exacerbate drought impacts on terrestrial ecosystems, especially in southwestern United States, the Mediterranean region and southern Africa.

Nanotechnology, particularly the application of nanoparticles (NPs), represents an innovative approach to strengthen crop resilience and enhance the sustainability of agriculture.

NPs have demonstrated potential in addressing key agricultural challenges, such as nutrient leaching, declining soil fertility, and reduced crop yield due to poor water management. However, applying NPs must consider regulatory and environmental concerns, including soil accumulation, toxicity to non-target organisms, and consumer perceptions of NP-enhanced products.

The current method used in the measurement of TDS and TSS includes conventional field and gravimetric approaches. These methods are limited due to the associated cost and labor, and limited spatial coverages. Remote Sensing (RS) applications have, however, been used over the past few decades as an alternative to overcome these limitations. Although they also present underlying atmospheric interferences in images, radiometric and spectral resolution issues. Studies of these WQPs with RS, therefore, require the knowledge and utilization of the best mechanisms. The use of RS for retrieval of TDS, TSS, and their forms has been explored in many studies using images from airborne sensors onboard unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and satellite sensors such as those onboard the Landsat, Sentinel-2, Aqua, and Terra platforms. The images and their spectral properties serve as inputs for deep learning analysis and statistical, and machine learning models. Methods used to retrieve these WQP measurements are dependent on the optical properties of the inland water bodies. While TSS is an optically active parameter, TDS is optically inactive with a low signal\u2013noise ratio. The detection of TDS in the visible, near-infrared, and infrared bands is due to some process that (usually) co-occurs with changes in the TDS that is affecting a WQP that is optically active. This study revealed significant improvements in incorporating RS and conventional approaches in estimating WQPs. The findings reveal that improved spatiotemporal resolution has the potential to effectively detect changes in the WQPs. For effective monitoring of TDS and TSS using RS, we recommend employing atmospheric correction mechanisms to reduce image atmospheric interference, exploration of the fusion of optical and microwave bands, high-resolution hyperspectral images, utilization of ML and deep learning models, calibration and validation using observed data measured from conventional methods. Further studies could focus on the development of new technology and sensors using UAVs and satellite images to produce real-time in situ monitoring of TDS and TSS.

These results were then compared with laboratory analysis of in-situ water samples, determined by gravimetric methods following standard protocols. The results showed that the algorithm developed using three-band ratios, the blue/green + red/green + NIR (near infra red)/green, produces a high R2 (0.70), indicating that this combination is reliable for use in estimating TSS content in a river section. The high accuracy of the red band for suspended sediment prediction is attributed to its spectral signature in turbid water, which shows higher reflectance compared to clean water.

The proposed channel division algorithm dynamically adjusts the count of subchannels to maximize Channel Division Gain (CDG), responding adeptly to fluctuations in network conditions and node density.

Brown algae are a source of active biomolecules and minerals that are currently used as agricultural biostimulants, since they increase crop productivity. This type of biostimulants derived from brown algae improve seed germination, increase the accumulation of plant biomass by accelerating cell division and elongation, activating the antioxidant system of plants, making them more resistant to stress, and contributes to the absorption and translocation of nutrients present in the soil. These products are also compatible with other agricultural inputs, such as synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, which makes them ideal for comprehensive applications and maintaining a balance in agroecosystems.

Additionally, the export of virtual water through rice trading and the looming water crisis poses significant threats to the sustainability of rice production and food security. There are several alternative rice production methods to improve water use efficiency. These include aerobic rice, direct-seeded rice (DSR), alternate wetting and drying (AWD), saturated soil culture (SSC), drip-irrigated rice, a system of rice intensification (SRI), and smart irrigation with sensors and the Internet of Things (IoT). However, each method has its own advantages and disadvantages. For example, drip-irrigated rice and IoT-based automated irrigation are not feasible for poor farmers due to the high production costs associated with specialized machinery and tools. Similarly, aerobic rice, drip-irrigated rice, and the SRI are labor-intensive, making them unsuitable for areas with a shortage of labor. On the other hand, DSR is suitable for labor-scarce areas, provided herbicides are used to control weeds. In this article, the suitability of different water-saving rice production methods is reviewed based on factors such as climate, soil type, labor, energy, and greenhouse gas emissions, and their prospects and challenges are evaluated.

They also lead to the destruction of the microbial population in both aquatic and the terrestrial regions, and hence, have necessitated the need for remediation. Although different remediation methods, such as the physical and chemical methods, have been adopted for years, however, the drawbacks and challenges associated with them have promoted the use of an alternative which is bioremediation. Bioremediation involves using biological agents such as plants and microbes to remove or lessen the effects of environmental pollutants. Of the two, microbes are more utilized primarily because of their rapid growth and ability to be easily manipulated, thus enhancing their function as agents of bioremediation. Different groups of bacteria, fungi and algae have been employed to clean up various environmental pollutants.

As a result, innovative solutions to improve water circulation management in both public and industrial sectors have been proposed, one of which is the introduction of Membrane Bioreactor (MBR) technology. This study aims to understand the mechanisms and characteristics of membrane fouling in MBR processes and compare the associated energy consumption, with the goal of improving process efficiency and energy performance.Methods:In this study, various factors influencing the MBR process were considered to analyze the mechanisms and characteristics of membrane fouling. The impact of fouling on the process was assessed, and energy consumption was compared. Specifically, the power consumption of flat-sheet and hollow-fiber MBRs was analyzed, focusing on the proportion of energy used for microbial treatment and membrane cleaning. The Specific Energy Demand (SED) was calculated to evaluate the energy consumption efficiency of different fouling control methods in MBRs.Results and Discussion:In typical MBR processes, 68.0% (flat-sheet) and 53.0% (hollow-fiber) of the power consumption is attributed to air scouring for microbial treatment and membrane cleaning. Notably, 57.0% (flat-sheet) and 36.0% (hollow-fiber) of the power is consumed to supply air for detaching adhered foulants to maintain filtration performance. These results indicate that aeration is a major energy consumer in MBR processes. SED is a critical indicator for assessing the energy consumption of specific fouling control methods, with typical MBR processes having an SED of 0.2-0.3kWh/m3. In contrast, using a non-aerated membrane module with reciprocating inertial force for fouling control reduces SED to 0.005-0.01 kWh/m3, representing a 20-60 fold decrease in energy consumption, highlighting the need for energy reduction.Conclusion:This study provides insights into fouling reduction characteristics in MBR processes, suggesting a new paradigm for enhancing the economic feasibility of MBR technology.

Plants growing in Cr(VI)-contaminated soils show reduced growth and development with lower agricultural production and quality.

Our results show that the Ru/CeO2 catalyst calcined in O2 at 500 \u00b0C initiates propane oxidation at 200 \u00b0C, achieves high conversion rates above 400 \u00b0C, and demonstrates almost no change in activity in the presence of water vapor across the entire studied temperature range of 200\u2013500 \u00b0C.

However, a significant portion of the food produced for human consumption is wasted annually on a global scale. Reducing harvest and postharvest food waste, waste during food processing, as well as food waste at the consumer level, have been key objectives of improving and maintaining sustainability. These issues can range from damage during processing, handling, and transport, to the use of inappropriate or outdated systems, and storage and packaging-related issues. Microbial growth and (cross)contamination during harvest, processing, and packaging, which causes spoilage and safety issues in both fresh and packaged foods, is an overarching issue contributing to food waste. Microbial causes of food spoilage are typically bacterial or fungal in nature and can impact fresh, processed, and packaged foods. Moreover, spoilage can be influenced by the intrinsic factors of the food (water activity, pH), initial load of the microorganism and its interaction with the surrounding microflora, and external factors such as temperature abuse and food acidity, among others. Considering this multifaceted nature of the food system and the factors driving microbial spoilage, there is an immediate need for the use of novel approaches to predict and potentially prevent the occurrence of such spoilage to minimize food waste at the harvest, post-harvest, processing, and consumer levels. Quantitative microbial spoilage risk assessment (QMSRA) is a predictive framework that analyzes information on microbial behavior under the various conditions encountered within the food ecosystem, while employing a probabilistic approach to account for uncertainty and variability. Widespread adoption of the QMSRA approach could help in predicting and preventing the occurrence of spoilage along the food chain. Alternatively, the use of advanced packaging technologies would serve as a direct prevention strategy, potentially minimizing (cross)contamination and assuring the safe handling of foods, in order to reduce food waste at the post-harvest and retail stages. Finally, increasing transparency and consumer knowledge regarding food date labels, which typically are indicators of food quality rather than food safety, could also contribute to reduced food waste at the consumer level. The objective of this review is to highlight the impact of microbial spoilage and (cross)contamination events on food loss and waste.

Heavy metals persistently present in the soil can be absorbed by plant tissues, enter the biosphere, and accumulate in the trophic levels of the food chain. The removal of heavy metals from contaminated soil can be accomplished using various physical, synthetic, and natural remediation techniques (both in situ and ex situ). The most controllable (affordable and eco-friendly) method among these is phytoremediation. The removal of heavy metal defilements can be accomplished using phytoremediation techniques, including phytoextraction, phytovolatilization, phytostabilization, and phytofiltration.

Using field and laboratory experiments, Allsup et al. showed that soil microbe communities sourced from colder or drier sites increased the survival of inoculated tree seedlings exposed to cold winters or drought, respectively (see the Perspective by Afkhami). These findings suggest greater potential resilience for trees and highlight the importance of species interactions in determining their response to climate change. \u2014Bianca Lopez Microbial communities sourced from more extreme climates can help tree seedlings tolerate cold and drought.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-05-26", "synthetic_support_claim": "Soil microbial communities from extreme climates improve tree seedling survival in cold or drought conditions.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Microbial communities enhance tree seedling growth and productivity across all climatic conditions."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "32d56b58e1124ee0528e4075afac225d5a27abd8", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/32d56b58e1124ee0528e4075afac225d5a27abd8", "title": "Unravelling the Molecular Dialogue of Beneficial Microbe-Plant Interactions.", "abstract": "Plants are an intrinsic part of the soil community, which is comprised of a diverse range of organisms that interact in the rhizosphere through continuous molecular communications.

Despite recent progress in our understanding of the rhizosphere and phyllosphere microbial communities of sugar maple, many outstanding knowledge gaps remain. This review delves into the relationships between sugar maple and its microbes, as climate change alters plant species distributions. It highlights the multifaceted roles of key microbes, such as arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and pathogens, in affecting the distribution and establishment of sugar maple in novel habitats. Furthermore, this review examines how microbial communities in different compartments contribute to tree fitness. Finally, it explores how microbial dispersal and altered species interactions under changing environmental conditions can affect sugar maple's ability to migrate beyond its current range, emphasizing the different scenarios associated with such shifts. In the rhizosphere, AM fungi are known for their roles in nutrient acquisition and improving stress tolerance. Yet, key questions remain about how these fungi interact with other microbes, how soil chemistry and climate change alter these interactions, and how the presence of beneficial microbes influences sugar maple's establishment. Additionally, the role of dark septate endophytes (DSE) in sugar maple's fitness remains underexplored, emphasizing the need for more research on their diversity and functions. In the phyllosphere, microbial communities are subject to shifts due to rising global change, with potential impacts on sugar maple's fitness. These changes may influence the tree's resistance to pathogens, tolerance to environmental stress, and overall health. Yet, our understanding of these interactions relies mostly on short-read sequencing methods targeting marker genes (e.g., 16S, ITS, 18S), which often fail to identify microbes at the species level. Limitations in molecular techniques and poor microbial reference databases hinder our ability to fully characterize tree-associated microbial diversity and functions. Future research should thus prioritize advanced molecular tools such as shotgun, hybrid, or long-read sequencing.

Despite extensive experimental and theoretical studies, debates persist about how various electrolyte components influence electrocatalytic reactions. We offer a concise review focusing on current discussions, especially the contentious roles of cations. This article further examines how different factors affect the interfacial solvent structure, particularly the hydrogen\u2010bonding network, and delves into the microscopic kinetics of electron and proton\u2010coupled electron transfer. We also discuss the overarching influence of solvents from a kinetic modeling perspective, aiming to develop a robust correlation between electrolyte structure and reactivity. Lastly, we summarize ongoing research challenges and suggest potential directions for future studies on electrolyte effects in electrocatalysis.\nIn 1956, Marcus theory was developed to describe the mechanism of outer\u2010sphere electron transfer (OS\u2010ET). In 1992, Nocera et al. directly measured proton\u2010coupled electron transfer (PCET) kinetics for the first time, and their subsequent research in 1995 investigated the effects of proton motion on electron transfer (ET) kinetics. In 1999 and 2000, Hammes\u2010schiffer et al. developed the multistate continuum theory for multiple charge reactions and deduced the rate expressions for nonadiabatic PCET reactions in solution, laying the theoretical foundation for the analysis of PCET kinetics in electrochemical processes. In 2006, Saveant et al. verified the concerted proton and electron transfer (CPET) mechanism in the oxidation of phenols coupled with intramolecular amine\u2010driven proton transfer (PT). Their subsequent work in 2008 reported the pH\u2010dependent pathways of electrochemical oxidation of phenols.Electrolyte effects in electrocatalysis have gained emphasis in recent years. In 2009, Markovic's pioneering work proposed non\u2010covalent interactions between hydrated alkaline cations and adsorbed OH species in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)/hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). In 2011, Markovic et al. significantly enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity in alkaline solution by improving water dissociation, which was assumed to dominate the sluggish HER kinetics in such media. In comparation, Yan et al. applied hydrogen binding energy (HBE) theory in 2015 to explain the pH\u2010dependent HER/HOR activity. Cations play a significant role in regulating the selectivity and activity of carbon dioxide reduction (CO2RR). In 2016 and 2017, Karen Chan et al. introduced the electric field generated by solvated cations to explain the cation effects on electrochemical CO2RR. Conversely, in 2021, Koper et al. suggested that short\u2010range electrostatic interactions between partially desolvated metal cations and CO2 stabilized CO2 and promoted CO2RR.Recent researches have combined the exploration of the electrical double layer (EDL) structure with theoretical analysis of PCET kinetics. In 2019, Huang et al. developed a microscopic Hamiltonian model to quantitatively understand the sluggish hydrogen electrocatalysis in alkaline media. In 2021, two meticulous studies from Shao\u2010Horn's group analyzed the effects of cations on reorganization energy and the impacts of hydrogen bonds between proton donors and acceptors on proton tunneling kinetics, respectively. Electrolyte effects on proton transport process were researched in recent years. In 2022, Hu et al. and Chen et al. proposed that the cation\u2010induced electric field distribution and pH\u2010dependent hydrogen bonding network connectivity played essential roles in proton transport, separately.\n\n", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2024-11-01", "synthetic_support_claim": "Cations play a significant role in regulating the selectivity and activity of carbon dioxide reduction.\n\n", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Cation effects on electrocatalytic CO2 reduction are solely due to short-range electrostatic interactions."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "0e181762e5659dbe8fa59f13cb32482cd1ede377", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0e181762e5659dbe8fa59f13cb32482cd1ede377", "title": "Numerical Modeling of CO2 Reduction Reactions in a Batch Cell with Different Working Electrodes", "abstract": "Batch cells are pivotal in advancing the foundational research of CO2 reduction by providing precise control over reaction conditions to study catalyst behavior and reaction mechanisms, generating insights that drive the development of scalable systems like flow reactors and ultimately supporting sustainability through the industrial adoption of carbon-neutral technologies.

To address this issue, the largest water-consuming sector has taken a series of measures termed as drip irrigation schemes. The primary purposes of drip irrigation are to reduce water scarcity near the root zone, reduce evaporation, and decrease water use. The application scope of drip irrigation is getting wider and wider, with the number of papers related to drip irrigation increasing year by year from 1990 to 2022. This study reviews crops planted in China that had been irrigated by drip irrigation equipment. The effects of drip irrigation technology on crop growth, physiology, quality, yield, and water use efficiency are summarized. This paper also provides an overview of drip irrigation technology on crop root development and nitrogen uptake. Through a global meta-analysis, it is found that in the case of water shortage, drip irrigation can save water and ensure crop yield compared to flooding irrigation, border irrigation, furrow irrigation, sprinkler irrigation, and micro-sprinkler irrigation. When the drip irrigation amount is more (100\u2013120%), drip irrigation significantly increases crop yields by 28.92%, 14.55%, 8.03%, 2.32%, and 5.17% relative to flooding irrigation, border irrigation, furrow irrigation, sprinkler irrigation, and micro-sprinkler irrigation, respectively. When water resources are sufficient, increasing the amount of drip irrigation also improves crop yield. Moreover, the researchers found that drip irrigation can reduce fertilizer leaching and soil salinity. However, more studies should be conducted in the future to enrich the research on drip irrigation.

Ecosystem water use efficiency (WUE) is pivotal for understanding carbon\u2013water cycle interplay.

Many areas across the globe rely for their precipitation supply on terrestrial precipitation recycling, which is the amount of precipitation that has evaporated from upwind land areas. Global warming and land-use changes may affect the future patterns of terrestrial precipitation recycling, but where and to which extent remains unclear. To study how the global patterns of precipitation recycling may change until the end of the 21st century, we present a new forward-tracking version of the three-dimensional atmospheric moisture-tracking model UTrack that is forced by output of the Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM2). We simulate global precipitation recycling in four Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) which are internally consistent combinations of climate and land-use scenarios used in the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. The scenarios range from mild to severe, namely SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5.

Nowadays, data is frequently held by various distributed silos, which are isolated from each other and confront limitations on data sharing. Given this, there have been some attempts to introduce federated learning into spatio-temporal mobility modeling. Meanwhile, the distributional heterogeneity inherent in the spatio-temporal data also puts forward requirements for model personalization. However, the existing methods tackle personalization in a model-centric manner and fail to explore the data characteristics in various data silos, thus ignoring the fact that the fundamental cause of insufficient personalization in the model is the heterogeneous distribution of data. In this paper, we propose a novel distribution-oriented personalized Federated learning framework for Cross-silo Spatio-Temporal mobility modeling (named FedCroST), that leverages learnable spatio-temporal prompts to implicitly represent the local data distribution patterns of data silos and guide the local models to learn the personalized information. Specifically, we focus on the potential characteristics within temporal distribution and devise a conditional diffusion module to generate temporal prompts that serve as guidance for the evolution of the time series. Simultaneously, we emphasize the structure distribution inherent in node neighborhoods and propose adaptive spatial structure partition to construct the spatial prompts, augmenting the spatial information representation. Furthermore, we introduce a denoising autoencoder to effectively harness the learned multi-view spatio-temporal features and obtain personalized representations adapted to local tasks. Our proposal highlights the significance of latent spatio-temporal data distributions in enabling personalized federated spatio-temporal learning, providing new insights into modeling spatio-temporal mobility in data silo scenarios.

Inputs of inorganic fertilizer and crop residue are key cropland anthropogenic managements, with potential to alter their soil ecological stoichiometry. We conducted a global synthesis of 682 data pairs to quantify the responses of soil carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) and grain yields to combined inputs of crop residue plus inorganic fertilizer compared with only inorganic fertilizer application. Crop residue inputs enhance soil C (10.5%\u201312%), N (7.63%\u20139.2%), and P (2.62%\u20135.13%) contents, with an increase in C:N (2.51%\u20133.42%) and C:P (7.27%\u20138.00%) ratios, and grain yields (6.12%\u20138.64%), indicating that crop residue alleviated soil C limitation caused by inorganic fertilizer inputs alone and was able to sustain balanced stoichiometry. Moreover, the increase in soil C and C:N(P) ratio reached saturation in ~13\u201316\u2009years after crop residue return, while grain yield increase trend discontinued. Furthermore, we identified that the increased C, N, and P contents and C:N(P) ratios were regulated by the initial pH and C content, and the increase in grain yield was not only related to soil properties, but also negatively related to the amount of inorganic N fertilizer input to a greater extent.

Therefore, this study investigates the effects of varying levels of wheat residue (WR) and nutrient management on GHGs emissions (CO2, N2O, and CH4) across three soil types: Alfisol, Vertisol, and Inceptisol. A combination of laboratory-based measurements and a variety of data analysis techniques was used to assess the GHG responses under four levels of WR inputs (0, 5, 10, and 15\u00a0Mg/ha; WR0, WR5, WR10, and WR15) and three levels of nutrient (NP0: no nutrient, NP1: nutrients (N and P) were added to balance the residue C/nutrient stoichiometry of C/N/P= 100: 8.3: 2.0 to achieve 30% stabilization of added residue C input at 5\u00a0Mg/ha (R5), and NP2: 3 \u00d7 NP1). The results of this study clearly showed that averaged across residue and nutrient input, Inceptisol showed negative N2O flux, suggesting consumption which was supported by its high legacy phosphorus (19.7\u00a0mg\u00a0kg\u207b1), elevated pH (8.49), and lower clay content (13%), which reduced microbial activity, as indicated by lower microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and alkaline phosphatase (Alk-P) levels. N2O emissions were more responsive to nutrient inputs, particularly in Vertisol under high WR (15\u00a0Mg/ha) input, while CH4 fluxes were significantly reduced under high residue inputs, especially in Vertisol and Inceptisol. Alfisol exhibited the highest total carbon mineralization and GWP, with cumulative GWP being 1.2\u00a0times higher than Vertisol and 1.4\u00a0times higher than Inceptisol across residue and nutrient input. The partial least square (PLS) regression revealed that anthropogenic factors significantly influenced CO2 and N2O fluxes more than CH4. The anthropogenic drivers contributed 62% and 44% of the variance explained for N2O and CH4 responses. Our study proves that different biogeochemical mechanisms operate simultaneously depending on the stoichiometry of residue C and nutrients influencing soil GHG responses.

Restoration of SOC levels would improve the soil\u2019s aggregate ability, physical, chemical, and biological properties, low greenhouse gas emission, and environmental sustainability. The importance of rainfed farming in India is increasing continuously with the increasing demand for feed, fodder, and fiber. It is technologically estimated that at any point in time, 50% of cropped area in India will remain under the rainfed system. The major challenges in rainfed areas include water scarcity, climate variability, and the lack of suitable technologies and practices resulting in half of SOC being present in arid soils than in moist environments. That's why the carbon sequestration in these soils requires a wide range of management practices to restore SOC levels. Conservation agriculture (CA) practices such as minimum tillage (MT), reduced tillage (RT), and zero tillage (ZT) may help in carbon sequestration and restoring SOC levels. The results of different studies revealed that ZT, MT and RT recorded higher total organic carbon, microbial biomass carbon, and particulate organic carbon as compared with conventional tillage and these are now established methods for promoting carbon sequestration and reducing greenhouse gas emissions in soils. The continuous tillage practices are a major threat to soil health, productivity, and fertility in dry areas. The tillage technology showed direct and indirect benefits in resource-saving ability and carbon sequestration. Long-term conservation tillage, judicious nutrient, and residue management practices increase the SOC content and enhance soil aggregation, hydraulic conductivity, soil porosity, and moisture retention capacity. Generally, the soil quality index (SQI) is used as a quantitative parameter to measure the effect of crop management practices on soil health. In tropical areas, the changes in different tillage practices, input, and residue management technologies offer a conclusive statement regarding the feasibility and sustainability of CA cropping systems. The SQI indicators are highly location and purpose-specific, as directly correlated with an ecosystem, physical, chemical, and biological processes, crop management variations, and properties of soil.

Description Losing the Amazon The Amazon rainforest is a biodiversity hotspot under threat from ongoing land conversion and climate change. Two Analytical Reviews in this issue synthesize data on forest loss and degradation in the Amazon basin, providing a clearer picture of its current status and future prospects. Albert et al. reviewed the drivers of change in the Amazon and show that anthropogenic changes are occurring much faster than naturally occurring environmental changes of the past. Although deforestation has been widely documented in the Amazon, degradation is also having major impacts on biodiversity and carbon storage. Lapola et al. synthesized the drivers and outcomes of Amazon forest degradation from timber extraction and habitat fragmentation, fires, and drought. \u2014BEL Two Reviews spotlight the threats of ongoing deforestation and degradation in the Amazon. BACKGROUND The Amazon is a critical component of the Earth climate system whose fate is embedded within that of the larger planetary emergency. The Amazon is the most species-rich subcontinental-scale ecosystem and is home to more than 10% of all named plant and vertebrate species, concentrated into just 0.5% of Earth\u2019s surface area. The Amazon rainforest is also a critical component of the Earth climate system, contributing about 16% of all terrestrial photosynthetic productivity and strongly regulating global carbon and water cycles. Amazonian ecosystems are being rapidly degraded by human industrial activities. A cumulative total of 17% of the original forest have already been cleared, and 14% replaced, by agricultural land use. After millions of years serving as an immense global carbon pool, under further warming the Amazon rainforest is predicted to become a net carbon source to the atmosphere. Some regions have already made the transition, with forest respiration and burning outpacing forest photosynthesis. ADVANCES In this Review, we compare rates of anthropogenic and natural environmental changes in the Amazon and South America and in the larger Earth system. We focus on deforestation and carbon cycles because of their critical roles on the Amazon and Earth systems. Data for South America were compiled for the Science Panel for the Amazon (SPA) Assessment Report, which details the many dimensions of the Amazon as a regional entity of the Earth system. The SPA report, coauthored by 240 scientists from 20 countries, documents epoch-scale transformations in Amazonian biodiversity, ecosystem function, and cultural diversity. We found that rates of anthropogenic processes that affect Amazonian ecosystems are up to hundreds to thousands of times faster than other natural climatic and geological phenomena. These anthropogenic changes reach the scale of millions of square kilometers within just decades to centuries, as compared with millions to tens of millions of years for evolutionary, climatic, and geological processes. The main drivers of Amazonian habitat destruction and degradation are land-use changes (such as land clearing, wildfires, and soil erosion), water-use changes (such as damming and fragmenting rivers and increased sedimentation from deforestation), and aridification from global climate change. Additional important threats come from overhunting and overfishing, introduction of invasive exotic species, and pollution from the mining of minerals and hydrocarbons. OUTLOOK Given the outsized role of the Amazon in our planetary hydrological cycle, large-scale deforestation of this region is expected to push the whole Earth system across a critical threshold to a qualitatively different global climate regime. Quite aside from biodiversity losses, such a transformation will have multifarious and catastrophic consequences for human welfare, including widespread water and food insecurity that will lead to mass migrations and political instability. The key message is that Amazonian environments are being degraded by human industrial activities at a pace far above anything previously known, imperiling its vast biodiversity reserves and globally important ecosystem services. The Amazon is now perched to transition rapidly from a largely forested to a nonforested landscape, and the changes are happening much too rapidly for Amazonian species, peoples, and ecosystems to respond adaptively. Policies to prevent the worst outcomes are known and must be enacted immediately. We now need political will and leadership to act on this information. To fail the Amazon is to fail the biosphere, and we fail to act at our peril. Amazon deforestation is accelerating from a combination of anthropogenic drivers, including drier climatic conditions and policies that favor industrialized agriculture.

This study utilized a split-split-plot experimental design with three replications. The main plots were designated to different water regimes (100, 80, 60, and 40% of estimated evapotranspiration), while the sub-plots were randomly distributed with Zn and Fe nanoparticle concentrations (0, 100, and 200 mg/L). The sub-sub-plots were randomly allocated to three maize cultivars (SC-P3062, SC-32D99, and SC-P3433). The results revealed that exposure to drought conditions resulted in a significant decline in the yield and yield-related attributes across all maize cultivars examined. Grain yield decreased by 10\u201350% under drought conditions. However, the foliar application of Zn and Fe nanoparticles was found to significantly improve grain yield, protein content, oil content, starch content, crude fiber, ash, and macro- and micronutrient concentrations in the maize cultivars under control and drought stress conditions. The foliar application of Zn and Fe nanoparticles at a concentration of 200 mg/L to the SC-P3433 maize cultivar led to the greatest grain yield per hectare, reaching 11,749 and 11,657 kg under the irrigation regimes with 100 and 80% total evapotranspiration, respectively.

We present the Fire Inventory from National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) version\u00a02.5 (FINNv2.5), a fire emissions inventory that provides publicly available emissions of trace gases and aerosols for various applications, including use in global and regional atmospheric chemistry modeling. FINNv2.5 includes numerous updates to the FINN version\u00a01 framework to better represent burned area, vegetation burned, and chemicals emitted. Major changes include the use of active fire detections from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) at 375\u2009m spatial resolution, which allows smaller fires to be included in the emissions processing. The calculation of burned area has been updated such that a more rigorous approach is used to aggregate fire detections, which better accounts for larger fires and enables using multiple satellite products simultaneously for emissions estimates. Fuel characterization and emissions factors have also been updated in FINNv2.5. Daily fire emissions for many trace gases and aerosols are determined for 2002\u20132019 (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-only fire detections) and 2012\u20132019 (MODIS\u2009+\u2009VIIRS fire detections).

Open straw burning has been widely recognized as a significant source of greenhouse gases (GHGs), posing critical risks to atmospheric integrity and potentially exacerbating global warming. In this study, we proposed a novel method that integrates crop cycle information into extraction and classification of fire spots from open straw burning in Northeast China from 2001 to 2020. By synergizing the extracted fire spots with the modified fire radiative power (FRP) algorithm, we developed high-spatial-resolution emission inventories of GHGs, including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). Results showed that the northern Sanjiang Plain, eastern Songnen Plain, and eastern Liao River plain were areas with high intensity of open straw burning. The number of fire spots was evaluated during 2013\u20132017, accounting for 58.2\u2009% of the total fire spots observed during 2001\u20132020. The prevalent season for open straw burning shifted from autumn (pre-2016) to spring (post-2016), accompanied by a more dispersed pattern in burning dates. The 2-decade cumulative emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O were quantified at 198\u2009Tg, 557\u2009Gg, and 15.7\u2009Gg, respectively, amounting to 218\u2009Tg of CO2-eq (equivalent). Significant correlations were identified between GHG emissions and both straw yield and straw utilization (p<0.01). The enforcement of straw-burning bans since 2018 has played a pivotal role in curbing open straw burning and has reduced fire spots by 51.7\u2009% on an annual basis compared to 2013\u20132017.

Fire is regarded as an essential climate variable, emitting greenhouse gases in the combustion process. Current global assessments of fire emissions traditionally rely on coarse remotely sensed burned-area data, along with biome-specific combustion completeness and emission factors (EFs). However, large uncertainties persist regarding burned areas, biomass affected, and emission factors. Recent increases in resolution have improved previous estimates of burned areas and aboveground biomass while increasing the information content used to derive emission factors, complemented by airborne sensors deployed in the tropics. To date, temperate forests, characterized by a lower fire incidence and stricter aerial surveillance restrictions near wildfires, have received less attention. In this study, we leveraged the distinctive fire season of 2022, which impacted western European temperate forests, to investigate fire emissions monitored by the atmospheric tower network. We examined the role of soil smoldering combustion responsible for higher carbon emissions, locally reported by firefighters but not accounted for in temperate fire emission budgets. We assessed the CO/CO2 ratio released by major fires in the Mediterranean, Atlantic pine, and Atlantic temperate forests of France. Our findings revealed low modified combustion efficiency (MCE) for the two Atlantic temperate regions, supporting the assumption of heavy smoldering combustion. This type of combustion was associated with specific fire characteristics, such as long-lasting thermal fire signals, and affected ecosystems encompassing needle leaf species, peatlands, and superficial lignite deposits in the soils. Thanks to high-resolution data (approximately 10\u2009m) on burned areas, tree biomass, peatlands, and soil organic matter (SOM), we proposed a revised combustion emission framework consistent with the observed MCEs. Our estimates revealed that 6.15\u2009Mt\u2009CO2 (\u00b12.65) was emitted, with belowground stock accounting for 51.75\u2009% (\u00b116.05). Additionally, we calculated a total emission of 1.14\u2009Mt\u2009CO (\u00b10.61), with 84.85\u2009% (\u00b13.75) originating from belowground combustion. As a result, the carbon emissions from the 2022 fires in France amounted to 7.95\u2009MtCO2-eq (\u00b13.62). These values exceed by 2-fold the Global Fire Assimilation System (GFAS) estimates for the country, reaching 4.18\u2009MtCO2-eq (CO and CO2). Fires represent 1.97\u2009% (\u00b10.89) of the country's annual carbon footprint, corresponding to a reduction of 30\u2009% in the forest carbon sink this year. Consequently, we conclude that current European fire emission estimates should be revised to account for soil combustion in temperate forests. We also recommend the use of atmospheric mixing ratios as an effective monitoring system of prolonged soil fires that have the potential to re-ignite in the following weeks.\n", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-01-13", "synthetic_support_claim": "Current European fire emission estimates should be revised to account for soil combustion in temperate forests.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Human activities significantly reduce the incidence and severity of wildfires in temperate forests."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "09007f304a90fb5739991f906ba3d36f0df9fb67", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/09007f304a90fb5739991f906ba3d36f0df9fb67", "title": "Molecular Level Modulation of Anthraquinone-containing Resorcinol-formaldehyde Resin Photocatalysts for H2O2 Production with Exceeding 1.2% Efficiency.", "abstract": "Designing polymeric photocatalysts at the molecular level to modulate the photogenerated charge behavior is a promising and challenging strategy for efficient hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) photosynthesis.

In\u2010situ ATR\u2010FTIR and theoretical investigations reveal that the secondary introduction of Cu plays multiple important roles: it activates lattice oxygen to trigger key proton transfer (PT) of MEAH+ via nucleophilic attack at the interface and subsequently favors deprotonated MEA as an efficient electron donor to accelerate electron transfer (ET) by enhancing orbital overlaps for the co\u2010activation of O2 and PMS. Such a stepwise proton\u2010coupled electron transfer (PCET)\u2010enhanced catalytic pathway mediated by CoOCu\u2010DAC is fundamentally different from common route identified in Co\u2010SAC\u2010involved Fenton\u2010like system. The established binary QSAR further substantiates the universality of PCET\u2010enhanced strategy toward versatile nitrogen\u2010containing organic compounds.

Therefore, novel systems are highly required to improve probiotics delivery. Methods In this study, Lactobacillus gasseri (L), Bifidobacterium bifidum (B), and a combination of L+B were encapsulated in chitosan (CS)-polyacrylic acid (PAA) complex systems (CS-PAA). The CS-PAA systems were analysed on basis of morphology, size, and zeta potential. The loaded CS-PAA systems were evaluated for their morphology, particle size, zetapotential, vaiability in both simulated gastroic and intestinal fluids, and stability at 4\u00b0C storage temparature. Moreover, the antibiofilm activity of the probiotics-loaded systems were evaluated againt Campylobacter jejuni, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. Results Probiotic strains were successfully incorporated into the porous structures of the CS-PAA systems, either individually or in combination. The Loaded L, B, and L+B showed higher particle size than the unloaded particles and excellent viability in simulated gastric and intestinal fluids, where the free probiotic species were undetected. Additionally the loaded probiotic exhibited an anti-biofilm effect at 0.5 mg/mL concentration level.

Climate sensitivity and aerosol forcing are two of the most central, but uncertain, quantities in climate science that are crucial for assessing historical climate as well as future climate projections. Here, we use a Bayesian approach to estimate inferred climate sensitivity and aerosol forcing using observations of temperature and global ocean heat content as well as prior knowledge of effective radiative forcing (ERF) over the industrial period. Due to limited information on uncertainties related to the time evolution of aerosol forcing, we perform a range of sensitivity analyses with idealized aerosol time evolution. The estimates are sensitive to the aerosol forcing pathway, with the mean estimate of inferred effective climate sensitivity ranging from 2.0 to 2.4\u2009K, present-day (2019 relative to 1750) aerosol ERF ranging from \u22120.7 to \u22121.1\u2009W\u2009m\u22122, and anthropogenic ERF ranging from 2.6 to 3.1\u2009W\u2009m\u22122.

In light of this, the imperative to gauge energy consumption takes center stage, paving the way for ecoconscious and sustainable video streaming solutions with a minimal carbon dioxide (CO2) footprint. This article meticulously examines the energy consumption and CO2 emissions of five popular open-source and fast video encoders: x264, x265, VVenC, libvpx-vp9, and SVT-AV1. These encoders are optimized software implementations of three video coding standards (AVC/H.264, HEVC/H.265, VVC/H.266) and two video formats (VP9 and AV1). To ensure a fair comparison, we also assess coding efficiency across these encoders at four distinct presets, applying three objective quality metrics. Additional factors like computing density and memory usage are considered. Our experiments employ the JVET-CTC video dataset, encompassing video sequences of diverse content and resolutions. Encoding is executed on an Intel x86 multicore processor, while CO2 emissions are computed based on the energy mix data from a server situated in France, reflecting an average emission rate of 101 g/kWh. Our findings underscore that the x264 and SVT-AV1 encoders, especially at fast and faster presets, exhibit the lowest energy consumption and CO2 emissions. Notably, x264 boasts the most energy-efficient performance, yielding CO2 emissions of 0.28, 0.91, 2.07, and 9.74 g when encoding videos using faster, fast, medium, and slower presets, respectively. Furthermore, SVT-AV1 and VVenC encoders operating at a slower preset demonstrate superior coding efficiency, albeit at the cost of higher computational complexity and CO2 emissions of 60.5 g and 406 g, respectively. A salient observation from our study is that resolution and encoder presets serve as crucial parameters for curbing energy consumption and CO2 emissions, albeit with an inherent tradeoff in video quality.

Remote sensing has been widely used to map rice extent in Malaysia, particularly in granary areas (facilitated by irrigation system), the main production zones. However, studies on non-granary areas (without irrigation systems) remain limited. This study addresses this gap by employing the Phenology-Expert Based Unsupervised Classification Method (PEB-UC) with Sentinel-2 time series data on the Google Earth Engine platform to map rice extent and cropping patterns at the sub-district level across Terengganu State, Malaysia, covering both granary and non-granary areas.

The excessive use of such fertilizers leaves residue on agricultural products, pollutes the environment, upsets agrarian ecosystems, and lowers soil quality. Furthermore, a significant proportion of the nutrient content, including nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, is lost from the soil (50\u201370%) before being utilized. Nanofertilizers, on the other hand, use nanoparticles to control the release of nutrients, making them more efficient and cost-effective than traditional fertilizers. Nanofertilizers comprise one or more plant nutrients within nanoparticles where at least 50% of the particles are smaller than 100 nanometers. Carbon nanotubes, graphene, and quantum dots are some examples of the types of nanomaterials used in the production of nanofertilizers. Nanofertilizers are a new generation of fertilizers that utilize advanced nanotechnology to provide an efficient and sustainable method of fertilizing crops. They are designed to deliver plant nutrients in a controlled manner, ensuring that the nutrients are gradually released over an extended period, thus providing a steady supply of essential elements to the plants. The controlled-release system is more efficient than traditional fertilizers, as it reduces the need for frequent application and the amount of fertilizer. These nanomaterials have a high surface area-to-volume ratio, making them ideal for holding and releasing nutrients. Naturally occurring nanoparticles are found in various sources, including volcanic ash, ocean, and biological matter such as viruses and dust. However, regarding large-scale production, relying solely on naturally occurring nanoparticles may not be sufficient or practical. In agriculture, nanotechnology has been primarily used to increase crop production while minimizing losses and activating plant defense mechanisms against pests, insects, and other environmental challenges. Furthermore, nanofertilizers can reduce runoff and nutrient leaching into the environment, improving environmental sustainability. They can also improve fertilizer use efficiency, leading to higher crop yields and reducing the overall cost of fertilizer application. Nanofertilizers are especially beneficial in areas where traditional fertilizers are inefficient or ineffective. Nanofertilizers can provide a more efficient and cost-effective way to fertilize crops while reducing the environmental impact of fertilizer application. They are the product of promising new technology that can help to meet the increasing demand for food and improve agricultural sustainability.

The overuse and inappropriate application of nitrogen fertilizers have resulted in environmental pollution, in addition to subjecting both humans and livestock to negative health hazards. Finding a viable substitute for traditional nitrogen fertilizers is crucial and essential to help improve crop yield and minimize environmental damage. Nano-nitrogen fertilizers offer a possible alternative to traditional fertilizers due to a slow/controlled release of nitrogen. The present work aimed to study the effect of a slow-release urea nanofertilizer on soil ammonical (NH4-N) and nitrate-N (NO3-N) content, culturable soil microflora, and soil enzyme activities in three different soil samples procured from Ludhiana and Patiala districts through a soil column study. Seven treatments, including 0, 50 (75 kg/ha N), 75 (112.5 kg/ha N), and 100% (150 kg/ha N) of the recommended dose (RD) of conventional urea and nano-urea fertilizer were applied. The leachate samples collected from nano-urea treatment exhibited NH4-N for the first two weeks, followed by NO3-N appearance. The higher NH4-N and NO3-N contents in the leachate were recorded for light-textured soil as compared to medium- and heavy-textured soil samples. The soil microbial counts and enzyme activities were recorded to be maximum in light-textured soils. Therefore, this slow-release formulation could be more useful for light-textured soils to decrease applied N-fertilizer losses, as well as for improving the soil microbial viable cell counts and soil enzyme activities. The effect of urea nanofertilizer on the growth and yield of direct-seeded rice (Oryza sativa L.) was also evaluated under field conditions. Both studies were performed independently. Numerically, the highest shoot height, fresh and dry shoot weight, and significantly maximum total chlorophyll, carotenoid, and anthocyanins were recorded in the T2 (100% RDF through nano-urea) treatment. The yield-attributing traits, including the number of filled grains and thousand-grain weight, were also recorded to have increased in T2 treatment. A numerical increase in NPK for plant and grain of rice at 100% RDN through nano-urea was recorded. The soil application of the product exhibited no negative effect on the soil microbial viable cell count on different doses of nano-urea fertilizer. The soil nitrogen fixer viable counts were rather improved in nano-urea treatments.

MPs and NPs absorb and act as a transport medium for harmful chemicals such as bisphenols, phthalates, polybrominated diphenyl ether, polychlorinated biphenyl ether, organotin, perfluorinated compounds, dioxins, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, organic contaminants, and heavy metals, which are commonly used as additives in plastic production. As the EDCs are not covalently bonded to plastics, they can easily leach into milk, water, and other liquids affecting the endocrine system of mammals upon exposure. The toxicity induced by MPs and NPs is size-dependent, as smaller particles have better absorption capacity and larger surface area, releasing more EDC and toxic chemicals.

The pseudo-second-order kinetic model described both organic dyes' adsorption on synthesized adsorbents. Accordingly, the calculated adsorption capacities of Congo Red (CR) and Malachite Green (MG) dyes over the synthesized adsorbents were found to be about 22.72 and 49.02\u2009mg/g for pure EV, 100 and 100\u2009mg/g for pure ZIF-67, 90.91 and 100\u2009mg/g for ZIF-67/EV-2, 100 and 100\u2009mg/g for ZIF-67/EV-5, 95.24 and 99.01\u2009mg/g for ZIF-67/EV-7, and 92.59 and 97.09\u2009mg/g for ZIF-67/EV-10, respectively.

The integrity of river systems has been threatened in profound ways over the last century. Pollution, damming, canalisation, and water grabbing are some examples of pressures threatening the entwined lifeworlds of human and non-human communities that depend on riverine systems. Finding ways to reverse the trends of environmental degradation demands complex spatial\u2013temporal, political, and institutional articulations across different levels of governance (from local to global) and among a plurality of actors who operate from diverse spheres of knowledge and systems of practice, and who have distinct capacities to affect decision-making. In this context, grassroots river initiatives worldwide use new multi-actor and multi-level dialogue arenas to develop proposals for river regeneration and promote social-ecological justice in opposition to dominant technocratic-hydraulic development strategies. This paper conceptualises these spaces of dialogue and action as RCAs and critically reflects on ways of organising and supporting RCAs while facilitating their cross-fertilisation in transdisciplinary practice. By integrating studies, debates, and theories from diverse disciplines, we generate multi-faceted insights and present cornerstones for the engagement with and/or enaction of RCAs.

Generally, groundwater is utilized for drinking purposes all over the globe. The surface is also utilized for human use and industrial purposes. There are several natural and anthropogenic activities responsible for the heavy metal contamination of water. Industrial sources, including coal washery, steel industry, food processing industry, plastic processing, metallic work, leather tanning, etc., are responsible for heavy metal contamination in water. Domestic and agricultural waste is also responsible for hazardous metallic contamination in water. Contaminated water with heavy metal ions like Cr (VI), Cd (II), Pb (II), As (V and III), Hg (II), Ni (II), and Cu (II) is responsible for several health issues in humans, like liver failure, kidney damage, gastric and skin cancer, mental disorders and harmful effects on the reproductive system. Hence, the evaluation of heavy metal contamination in water and its removal is needed. There are several physicochemical methods that are available for the removal of heavy metals from water, but these methods are expensive and generate large amounts of secondary pollutants.

The introduction of defects and atomic doping can optimize the electronic structure of g\uf8ffC3N4 and improve the light absorption and carrier separation efficiency. Herein, the high efficiency of carbon nitride photocatalysis for hydrogen evolution in visible light is achieved by an S-modified double-deficient site strategy.

The research focuses on Milan and Lecce, analyzing how urban geometry affects SUHII. Factors such as building height, aspect ratio, sky visibility, and surface cover are examined using approximately 1000 satellite images from 2022 and 2023. The study highlights seasonal and diurnal variations in SUHII, with particular emphasis on HW periods. Through multicollinearity and multiple regression analyses, the study identifies the main morphological drivers influencing SUHII in the two cities, specifically the Impervious Surface Fraction (ISF) and Mean Building Height (HM). Milan consistently exhibits higher SUHII, particularly during HWs, while Lecce experiences a negative SUHII, especially during the summer, due to lower urban density, more vegetation, and the low soil moisture around the urban area. Both cities show positive SUHII values at night, which are slightly elevated during HWs.

Although heatwaves are one of the most dangerous types of weather-related hazards, their underlying mechanisms are not yet sufficiently understood. In particular, there is still no scientific consensus about the relative importance of the three key processes: horizontal temperature transport, subsidence accompanied by adiabatic heating, and diabatic heating. The current study quantifies these processes using an Eulerian method based on tracer advection, which allows one to extract Lagrangian information. For each grid point at any time, the method yields a decomposition of temperature anomalies into the aforementioned processes, complemented by the contribution of a pre-existing anomaly. Two different approaches for this decomposition are employed. The first approach is based on the full fields of the respective terms and has been established in prior research. In contrast, the second approach is based on the anomaly fields of the respective terms, i.e. deviations from their corresponding climatologies, and is introduced in this study. The two approaches offer two distinct perspectives on the same subject matter. By analysing two recent heatwaves, it is shown that the two decompositions yield substantial differences regarding the relative importance of the processes. A statistical analysis indicates that these differences are not coincidental but are characteristic of the respective regions. We conclude that the Lagrangian characterization of heatwaves is a matter of perspective.\n", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-01-29", "synthetic_support_claim": "The Lagrangian characterization of heatwaves is a matter of perspective.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Heatwave intensity will significantly increase in the next decade due to climate change-induced shifts in weather patterns."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "15c938e27ddb83743f4fbbb154d223b76867e9d7", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/15c938e27ddb83743f4fbbb154d223b76867e9d7", "title": "Plant and Microbial Approaches as Green Methods for the Synthesis of Nanomaterials: Synthesis, Applications, and Future Perspectives", "abstract": "The unique biological and physicochemical characteristics of biogenic (green-synthesized) nanomaterials (NMs) have attracted significant interest in different fields, with applications in the agrochemical, food, medication delivery, cosmetics, cellular imaging, and biomedical industries.

The focus is on evaluating key utilization methods\u2014anaerobic digestion, thermal treatment (pyrolysis and gasification), composting, and bioconversion\u2014for transforming sludge into valuable resources such as biogas, biochar, and compost. These methods are assessed based on their alignment with sustainable waste management theories and practices, particularly concerning environmental sustainability and resource recovery. Empirical data from case studies and industry reports are incorporated to provide concrete examples of successful sludge utilization practices. For instance, empirical data indicate that anaerobic digestion can reduce sludge volume by up to 70% and generate biogas with an energy yield of approximately 25\u2009MJ per kg of dry sludge. Pyrolysis can sequester up to 3\u2009t of CO2 per ton of biochar produced.

The C sequestration contribution of biochar hinges not only on its fused aromatic structure but also on its abiotic and biotic reactions with soil components across its entire life cycle in the environment. For instance, minerals and microorganisms can deeply participate in the mineralization or complexation of the labile (soluble and easily decomposable) and even recalcitrant fractions of biochar, thereby profoundly affecting C cycling and sequestration in soil. Here we identify five key issues closely related to the application of biochar for C sequestration in soil and review its outstanding advances. Specifically, the terms use of biochar, pyrochar, and hydrochar, the stability of biochar in soil, the effect of biochar on the flux and speciation changes of C in soil, the emission of nitrogen-containing greenhouse gases induced by biochar production and soil application, and the application barriers of biochar in soil are expounded. By elaborating on these critical issues, we discuss the challenges and knowledge gaps that hinder our understanding and application of biochar for C sequestration in soil and provide outlooks for future research directions. We suggest that combining the mechanistic understanding of biochar-to-soil interactions and long-term field studies, while considering the influence of multiple factors and processes, is essential to bridge these knowledge gaps.

To solve increasingly serious environmental pollution problems, the Chinese government has committed itself to achieving the goals of peak carbon emissions and carbon neutrality.

Methods This study analyzes the basic situation, spatial network, and influencing factors of low-carbon patent applications in China since 2001 at the provincial and urban agglomeration levels using social network analysis based on data from the Incopat global patent database. Results The following findings are established. (1) From the number of low-carbon patent applications, the total number of low-carbon patent applications in China increased year by year, while the number of applications in the eastern region was larger than those in the central and western regions, but such regional differences had been decreasing. (2) At the interprovincial level, low-carbon patent applications showed a complex and multithreaded network structure. In particular, the eastern coastal provinces occupied the core position in the network. The weighted degree distribution of China's interprovincial low-carbon patent cooperation network is affected by various factors, including economic development, financial support, local scientific research level, and low-carbon awareness. (3) At the urban agglomeration level, the eastern coastal urban agglomerations showed a radial structure with the central city as the core. Urban innovation capability, economic development, low-carbon development awareness, level of technology import from overseas, and informatization level are highly correlated with the weighted degree of low-carbon cooperation networks of urban agglomerations.

Davis led an independent research program from 1981 to 2023, beginning at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (VPI) and then transitioning to the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). His research program was marked by exceptional creativity, breadth, and depth. With classical training in reaction engineering, Davis developed expertise in experimental heterogeneous catalysis and led work in this discipline for more than 40 years. His name is synonymous with zeolites, and today, he is one of the most widely recognized experts in zeolite synthesis, characterization, and catalysis in the world. Early work at the VPI focused on zeolites and catalysis with supported metal coordination complexes. His creativity was evident at the earliest stages of his career, with the development of supported aqueous phase catalysts and the world\u2019s first crystalline, extra-large pore molecular sieve, both reported in the late 1980s. A move to Caltech saw a significant expansion of his zeolite synthesis program and the rapid acceleration of a multidecade collaboration with Dr. Stacey I. Zones of Chevron. At Caltech, his work expanded to include studies of molecular recognition and catalysis with organic/inorganic hybrid materials, and he developed a large, parallel program in drug delivery. His work on catalysis heavily emphasized zeolite catalysis, including major thrusts on the conversion of sugars in the liquid phase and methanol in the gas phase. Numerous new zeolites and molecular sieves were discovered throughout the four decades of the Davis laboratory, highlighted by a successful, multidecade quest to prepare a chiral zeolite with enantioselective catalytic properties. Davis is one of the most decorated researchers of the last four decades. He is one of only 21 living people currently elected to all of the US National Academies (Engineering, Science, Medicine) and elected as a Fellow of the National Academy of Inventors. He was the first engineer to win the NSF\u2019s Alan T. Waterman Award and is one of only two researchers (to date) to win the International Zeolite Association\u2019s Donald Breck Award twice (1989, 2019).

Therefore, understanding the impacts of CC and soil degradation on plant physiology is crucial for the sustainable development of mitigation strategies to prevent crop productivity losses. The amino acid proline has long been recognized for playing distinct roles in plant cells undergoing osmotic stress. Due to its osmoprotectant and redox-buffering ability, a positive correlation between proline accumulation and plants\u2019 tolerance to abiotic stress has been pointed out in numerous reviews. Indeed, proline quantification is used systematically by plant physiologists as an indicator of the degree of tolerance and a measurement of the antioxidant potential in plants under stressful conditions. Moreover, the exogenous application of proline has been shown to increase resilience to several stress factors, including those related to soil degradation such as salinity and exposure to metals and xenobiotics. However, recent data from several studies often refer to proline accumulation as a signal of stress sensitivity with no clear correlation with improved antioxidant activity or higher stress tolerance, including when proline is used exogenously as a stress reliever. Nevertheless, endogenous proline levels are strongly modified by these stresses, proving its involvement in plant responses. Hence, one main question arises\u2014is proline augmentation always a sign of improved stress resilience? From this perspective, the present review aims to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the implications of proline accumulation in plants under abiotic stress induced by soil degradation factors, reinforcing the idea that proline quantification should not be employed as a sole indicator of stress sensitivity or resilience but rather complemented with further biochemical and physiological endpoints.", "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-03-01", "synthetic_support_claim": "Proline quantification should not be employed as a sole indicator of stress sensitivity or resilience.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Proline accumulation universally enhances plant resilience to all forms of abiotic stress."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "29bdfc3cde706467cbade9e589f94f93b9ce37b1", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/29bdfc3cde706467cbade9e589f94f93b9ce37b1", "title": "Analysis of salinity-induced metabolome changes in Indian mustard (Brassica juncea) roots and shoots: hydroponic versus microplot cultivation.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nBrassica juncea L.

Arsenic stress reduced growth by 56.7%, water content by 7.39%, and osmotic potential by 26.2% in lettuce leaves compared to control. Conversely, SA1 and SA2 treatments mitigated the adverse effects of arsenic on growth and preserved the water balance in plants.

Exogenous SA1 treatment significantly improved photosynthesis, whereas SA2 provided milder benefits and SA3 did not reduce the adverse effects of arsenic exposure. Arsenic stress increased H2O2 content by 47.3% and lipid peroxidation by 33.4% in lettuce seedlings. SA1 treatment effectively reduced oxidative stress by enhancing the activities of key antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POX).

Here, we show the primacy of synoptic-scale feedback in driving extreme fires in Mediterranean and monsoon climate regimes in the West Coast of the United States and Southeastern Asia.

However, the favorable weather patterns for transport toward inland China and how they interact with BB aerosols are not fully understood. In this study, we identified three predominant synoptic weather processes associated with evident BB plume transport toward southern China over the past 20\u00a0years. The first two\u2014the low pressure over the continent and the cold frontal passage\u2014account for more than 76% of all the events.

The second type is caused by a frontal passage lasting only 1\u20132\u00a0days, which lifts BB plumes to above 700\u00a0hPa and transports them downstream.

Such a unique nonmineralizing oxidation achieved an ultrahigh electron utilization efficiency (ephenols/ePDS) of 182%.

Ruminants establish a symbiotic relationship with their microbiome, and the latter is the workhorse of carbohydrate fermentation. On the other hand, during carbohydrate fermentation, synthesis of propionate sequesters H, thus reducing its availability for the ultimate production of methane (CH4) by methanogenic archaea. Biochemically, methane is the simplest alkane and represents a downturn in energetic efficiency in ruminants; environmentally, it constitutes a potent greenhouse gas that negatively affects climate change. Prevotella is a very versatile microbe capable of processing a wide range of proteins and polysaccharides, and one of its fermentation products is propionate, a trait that appears conspicuous in P. ruminicola strain 23. Since propionate, but not acetate or butyrate, constitutes an H sink, propionate-producing microbes have the potential to reduce methane production. Accordingly, numerous studies suggest that members of the genus Prevotella have the ability to divert the hydrogen flow in glycolysis away from methanogenesis and in favor of propionic acid production.

This implies approximating a starspot as a nonmagnetic 1D structure in radiative\u2013convective equilibrium, parametrizing convective energy transport by mixing-length theory. It is the inhibition of convection by the starspot magnetic field that is emulated by using a lower spot temperature relative to the quiet stellar regions.

We find that the 1D models fail to return accurate umbral and penumbral spectra on K0V and M0V stars, where convective and radiative transfer of energy is simultaneously important over a broad range of atmospheric heights, rendering mixing-length theory inaccurate. However, 1D models work well for G2V stars, where both radiation and convection significantly contribute to energy transfer only in a narrow region near the stellar surface. Quantitatively, the 1D approximation leads to errors longward of 500 nm of about 50% for both umbral and penumbral flux contrast relative to quiet star regions on M0V stars and less than 2% (for umbrae) and 10% (for penumbrae) for G2V stars.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-11-21", "synthetic_support_claim": "1D models fail to return accurate umbral and penumbral spectra on K0V and M0V stars.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Starspot spectra on M0V stars can be accurately represented using nonmagnetic 1D structures in radiative\u2013convective equilibrium."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "467a8ebf5aa35fa21bc4b4f8259fc616faeaa1e3", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/467a8ebf5aa35fa21bc4b4f8259fc616faeaa1e3", "title": "Evidence for a Volcanic Atmosphere on the Sub-Earth L 98-59 b", "abstract": "\n Assessing the prevalence of atmospheres on rocky planets around M-dwarf stars is a top priority of exoplanet science.

We investigated the macromolecular organic matter in Ryugu samples and found that it contains aromatic and aliphatic carbon, ketone, and carboxyl functional groups. The spectroscopic features of the organic matter are consistent with those in chemically primitive carbonaceous chondrite meteorites that experienced parent-body aqueous alteration (reactions with liquid water). The morphology of the organic carbon includes nanoglobules and diffuse carbon associated with phyllosilicate and carbonate minerals. Deuterium and/or nitrogen-15 enrichments indicate that the organic matter formed in a cold molecular cloud or the presolar nebula. The diversity of the organic matter indicates variable levels of aqueous alteration on Ryugu\u2019s parent body. Description INTRODUCTION Organic compounds in asteroids and comets contain information about the early history of the Solar System. They could also have delivered organic material to early Earth. The Hayabusa2 spacecraft visited the carbonaceous asteroid Ryugu and collected samples of its surface materials, which were brought to Earth in December 2020. RATIONALE We investigated the macromolecular organic matter in the Ryugu samples, measuring its elemental, isotopic, and functional group compositions along with its small-scale structures and morphologies. Analytical methods used included spectro-microscopies, electron microscopy, and isotopic microscopy. We examined intact Ryugu grains and insoluble carbonaceous residues isolated by acid treatment of the Ryugu samples. RESULTS Organic matter is abundant in the Ryugu grains, distributed as submicrometer-sized organic grains and as organic matter dispersed in matrix. The Ryugu organic matter consists of aromatic carbons, aliphatic carbons, ketones, and carboxyls. The functional group compositions are consistent with those of insoluble organic matter (IOM) from primitive carbonaceous CI (Ivuna-type) and CM (Mighei-type) chondritic meteorites. Those meteorites experienced aqueous alteration (reactions with liquid water) on their parent bodies, which implies that the Ryugu organic material was also modified by aqueous alteration on the asteroid parent body. The functional group distributions of the Ryugu organic matter vary on submicrometer scales in ways that relate to the morphologies: nanoparticulate and/or nanoglobular regions are aromatic-rich, whereas organic matter associated with Mg-rich phyllosilicate matrix and carbonates is IOM-like or occurs as diffuse carbon. The observed macromolecular diversity provides further evidence that the organics were modified by aqueous alteration on Ryugu\u2019s parent body. The diffuse carbon is similar to clay-bound organic matter that occurs in CI chondrites and the ungrouped C2-type meteorite Tagish Lake. No graphite-like material was found, which indicates that the Ryugu organic matter was not subjected to heating events on the parent body. The bulk hydrogen and nitrogen isotopic ratios of the Ryugu grains are between the bulk values of CI chondrites and the IOM in CI chondrites. Some carbonaceous grains showed extreme deuterium (D) and/or nitrogen-15 (15N) enrichments or depletions. These indicate an origin in the interstellar medium or presolar nebula. The bulk hydrogen isotopic ratios of insoluble carbonaceous residues from the Ryugu samples are lower than those in CI and CM chondrites. The range of D enrichments are consistent with the ranges of CI, CM, and Tagish Lake chondrites. The nitrogen isotopic ratios of the IOM from Ryugu samples were close to those in CI chondrites. CONCLUSION The organic matter in Ryugu probably consists of primordial materials that formed during (or before) the early stages of the Solar System\u2019s formation, which were later modified by heterogeneous aqueous alteration on Ryugu\u2019s parent body asteroid. Although the surface of Ryugu is exposed to solar wind, impacts, and heating by sunlight, the macromolecular organics in the surface grains of Ryugu are similar in their chemical, isotopic, and morphological compositions to those seen in primitive carbonaceous chondrites. The properties of Ryugu\u2019s organic matter could explain the low albedo of the asteroid\u2019s surface. Chemical evolution of macromolecular organic matter in samples of asteroid Ryugu. Organic matter formed in the interstellar medium or in the outer region of the protoplanetary disk that formed the Solar System. It was then incorporated into a planetesimal\u2014Ryugu\u2019s parent body\u2014where it experienced varying degrees of reactions with liquid water. An impact ejected material from the parent body, which reassembled to form Ryugu. Samples were brought to Earth by Hayabusa2.

PTIR spectra enable material identification at the nanoscale and can measure sample composition at depths >1 \u03bcm. However, implementation of quantitative, multivariate, nanoscale IR analysis requires an improved understanding of PTIR signal transduction and of the intensity dependence on sample characteristics and measurement parameters. Here, PTIR spectra measured on three-dimensional printed conical structures up to 2.5 \u03bcm tall elucidate the signal dependence on sample thickness for different IR laser repetition rates and pulse lengths. Additionally, we develop a model linking sample thermal expansion dynamics to cantilever excitation amplitudes that includes samples that do not fully thermalize between consecutive pulses. Remarkable qualitative agreement between experiments and theory demonstrates a monotonic increase in the PTIR signal intensity with thickness, with decreasing sensitivities at higher repetition rates, while signal intensity is nearly unaffected by laser pulse length. Although we observe slight deviations from linearity over the entire 2.5 \u03bcm thickness range, the signal's approximate linearity for bands of sample thicknesses up to \u2248500 nm suggests that samples with comparably low topographic variations are most amenable to quantitative analysis. Importantly, we measure absorptive undistorted profiles in PTIR spectra for strongly absorbing modes, up to \u22481650 nm, and >2500 nm for other modes.

Three nitrogen application gradients were established: low nitrogen (150 kg\u00b7hm\u22122, N1), medium nitrogen (225 kg\u00b7hm\u22122, N2), and high nitrogen (300 k kg\u00b7hm\u22122, N3).

It has been assessed that the majority of medical waste does not pose a risk to humans. It is estimated that 15% of the total amount of produced HCW is hazardous and can be infectious, toxic or radioactive. Hazardous waste is a special type of waste which, if not properly treated, can pose a risk to human health and to the environment. HCW contains potentially harmful microorganisms that can be spread among healthcare personnel, hospital patients and the general public, causing serious illnesses. Healthcare personnel are the specialists especially exposed to this risk. The most common medical procedure, which pose the highest risk, is injection (i.e, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intravenous, taking blood samples). The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that around 16 billion injections are administered worldwide each year. However, if safety precautions are not followed, and needles and syringes are not properly disposed of, the risk of sharps injuries increases among medical staff, waste handlers and waste collectors. What is more, sharps injuries increase the risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV/HCV), tuberculosis (TB), diphtheria, malaria, syphilis, brucellosis and other transmissions. Disposing of medical waste in a landfill without segregation and processing will result in the entry of harmful microorganisms, chemicals or pharmaceuticals into soil and groundwater, causing their contamination. Open burning or incinerator malfunctioning will result in the emission of toxic substances, such as dioxins and furans, into the air. In order to reduce the negative impact of medical waste, waste management principles should be formulated. To minimize health risks, it is also important to build awareness among health professionals and the general public through various communication and educational methods.

As such, determining native protein structures may elucidate structural states previously unknown for even well-characterized proteins. Here, we apply the bottom-up structural proteomics method, cryoID, toward a model methanogenic archaeon. While they are keystone organisms in the global carbon cycle and active members of the human microbiome, there is a general lack of characterization of methanogen enzyme structure and function. Through the cryoID approach, we successfully reconstructed and identified the native Methanosarcina acetivorans pyridoxal 5\u2032-phosphate (PLP) synthase (PdxS) complex directly from cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) images of fractionated cellular lysate. We found that the native PdxS complex exists as a homo-dodecamer of PdxS subunits, and the previously proposed supracomplex containing both the synthase (PdxS) and glutaminase (PdxT) was not observed in cellular lysate. Our structure shows that the native PdxS monomer fashions a single 8\u03b1/8\u03b2 TIM-barrel domain, surrounded by seven additional helices to mediate solvent and interface contacts. A density is present at the active site in the cryo-EM map and is interpreted as ribose 5-phosphate. In addition to being the first reconstruction of the PdxS enzyme from a heterogeneous cellular sample, our results reveal a departure from previously published archaeal PdxS crystal structures, lacking the 37-amino-acid insertion present in these prior cases. This study demonstrates the potential of applying the cryoID workflow to capture native structural states at atomic resolution for archaeal systems, for which traditional biochemical sample preparation is nontrivial. IMPORTANCE Archaea are one of the three domains of life, classified as a phylogenetically distinct lineage. There is a paucity of known enzyme structures from organisms of this domain, and this is often exacerbated by characteristically difficult growth conditions and a lack of readily available molecular biology toolkits to study proteins in archaeal cells. As a result, there is a gap in knowledge concerning the mechanisms governing archaeal protein behavior and their impacts on both the environment and human health; case in point, the synthesis of the widely utilized cofactor pyridoxal 5\u2032-phosphate (PLP; a vitamer of vitamin B6, which humans cannot produce). By leveraging the power of single-particle cryo-EM and map-to-primary sequence identification, we determine the native structure of PLP synthase from cellular lysate.

Among all introduced non\u2010native fish species, catfish production is particularly notable, with P. hypophthalmus contributing 1.6 million metric tons (mmt) and C. gariepinus reaching 0.4\u2009mmt. This paper examines the ecological, biodiversity, environmental, and disease concerns associated with the intensive aquaculture of the non\u2010native catfish species, using a OneHealth approach to assess sustainability. Generated information on biological plasticity, resource competition, genetic interactions, invasion risks, biodiversity impacts, food safety, and disease risks in extensive aquaculture of non\u2010native catfish are presented. A risk assessment (RA) was performed using an Excel\u2013based developed module having 28 attributes and rated on a scale of 1 to 5. The results indicated significant risks, particularly for C. gariepinus, which had a risk score of 116 out of total 140 response points obtained from 65 farmers, manifesting 82.85% risk. In comparison, P. hypophthalmus had a response score of 85, displaying 60.71% risk. The findings suggest that C. gariepinus poses a higher ecological risk than P. hypophthalmus, primarily due to poorly controlled aquaculture practices, inadequate biosecurity, and insufficient regulatory measures.

However, videos obtained from the maritime surface often encounter challenges such as scene blurring, oscillations of USV observation platforms, and nonlinear movements of objects, significantly affecting the tracking performance. In response to these challenges, this article builds upon ByteTrack to introduce the maritime object motion tracker (MOMT), employing YOLOv7 as the object detector. Diverging from ByteTrack, MOMT proposes a new metric function and incorporates Gaussian cascade matching for a more refined handling of low-score and unmatched bounding boxes. In addition, an augmented observation Kalman filter (KF) module is developed to diminish the effects of nonlinear motion in objects. Specifically, first, in establishing the relationship between adjacent frames, the Fuse-distance metric function is proposed by synthesizing information on intersection over union (IoU) distance, object category, and size, to determine the optimal matching between detection boxes and KF prediction boxes. Second, the introduction of the Gaussian cascade matching module better addresses the issue of frequent identity switches (IDSs) caused by significant shaking of the USV observation platform. In addition, to cope with the impact of nonlinear object motion, the combination of camera motion compensation (CMC) and the observation-centric KF is employed to mitigate estimation errors in the KF. Finally, MOMT is compared with other state-of-the-art tracking algorithms on the Singapore Maritime Dataset, achieving competitive performance with 46.0 multiple object tracking accuracy (MOTA) and 66.7 IDF1, and operating in real time at a speed of 44.6 frames per second (FPS).

This growth presents both significant challenges and opportunities for enhancing the accuracy of ship detection and tracking through the application of artificial intelligence. This article introduces a multi-object tracking system designed for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), utilizing the YOLOv7 and Deep SORT algorithms for detection and tracking, respectively. To mitigate the impact of limited ship data on model training, transfer learning techniques are employed to enhance the YOLOv7 model\u2019s performance. Additionally, the integration of the SimAM attention mechanism within the YOLOv7 detection model improves feature representation by emphasizing salient features and suppressing irrelevant information, thereby boosting detection capabilities. The inclusion of the partial convolution (PConv) module further enhances the detection of irregularly shaped or partially occluded targets. This module minimizes the influence of invalid regions during feature extraction, resulting in more accurate and stable features. The implementation of PConv not only improves detection accuracy and speed but also reduces the model\u2019s parameters and computational demands, making it more suitable for deployment on computationally constrained UAV platforms. Furthermore, to address issues of false negatives during clustering in the Deep SORT algorithm, the IOU metric is replaced with the DIOU metric at the matching stage. This adjustment enhances the matching of unlinked tracks with detected objects, reducing missed detections and improving the accuracy of target tracking. Compared to the original YOLOv7+Deep SORT model, which achieved an MOTA of 58.4% and an MOTP of 78.9%, the enhanced system achieves a MOTA of 65.3% and a MOTP of 81.9%.

However, the mechanisms underlying the developmental process of monoecious figs in response to the entry of pollinating fig wasps (pollinators) and the metabolic changes occurring during this process remain elusive. Our study employed a combination of controlled experiments in the field and LC-MS methods to investigate the impact of pollinating fig wasp entry on the developmental phase of figs, as well as the metabolic alterations occurring during this process. A total of 381 metabolites and 155 differential metabolites were identified, with the predominant classes of metabolites being organic acids, lipids, and benzene aromatic compounds. The results suggest that in the absence of wasp entry, the receptive phase of fig would exhibit an extended duration. However, upon the entry of fig wasps, the receptive phase of figs would terminate within a span of 1 to 2 days, concomitant with substantial fluctuations in the composition and proportions of metabolites within the fig. Our research focuses on the analysis of linoleic acid metabolism, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and flavonoid biosynthesis pathways. Our findings suggest that the entry of wasps triggers alterations in the metabolic regulatory mechanisms of figs. Prior to wasp entry, metabolites primarily regulate fig growth and development. However, after wasp entry, metabolites predominantly govern lipid accumulation and the establishment of defense mechanisms, indicating a transition in fig development. This metabolic perspective explains why figs promptly enter an interflower phase that is not attractive to pollinating fig wasps after their entry, and how figs achieve reproductive balance through the regulation of different metabolic pathways.

For instance, restoration in these refined focal areas would cover 28% greater imperilled species richness, 45% greater water importance and 26% more families falling below the poverty line.\n\nBy examining overlap between our refined focal areas and U.S. Forest Service top ranked firesheds (a prominent existing wildfire prioritization scheme), we show that our analysis can help to target wildfire mitigation efforts within firesheds to areas with particularly high social vulnerability and/or ecological value, providing an important compliment to a prioritization scheme based largely on risk to structures.\n\nOur results highlight the importance of considering ecological and social factors when implementing wildfire mitigation treatments and provide actionable guidance for integrating these considerations into existing prioritizations.\n\nRead the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-11-21", "synthetic_support_claim": "Inclusion of social and ecological considerations substantially increased representation of vulnerable communities and ecological values.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Human interventions have no significant impact on reducing the severity of wildfires in vulnerable communities."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "bd3fcc644d1a18c307165032f875f94863dec9e5", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bd3fcc644d1a18c307165032f875f94863dec9e5", "title": "Canadian forests are more conducive to high-severity fires in recent decades.", "abstract": "Canada has experienced more-intense and longer fire seasons with more-frequent uncontrollable wildfires over the past decades.

It has recently gained popularity in microplastic (MP) pollution research to determine the chemical composition of unknown plastic fragments. However, it could also be used to evaluate the degree of ageing of MPs collected from the environment. In this context, the principal aim of our research has been to qualitatively evaluate the natural weathering of environmental MPs collected in an Italian freshwater body (the Ofanto River) using ATR-FTIR technology. Furthermore, we compared environmental particles to weathered artificial MPs under controlled light and temperature conditions and to unaltered pristine materials to assess the results. FTIR spectra were acquired using a Nicolet Summit FTIR (ThermoFisher Scientific) equipped with an Everest ATR with a diamond Crystal plate and a DTGS KBr detector (wavenumber range 4000\u2013500 cm\u22121, 32 scans per spectrum, spectral resolution of 4 cm\u22121). The degree of ageing was assessed using three different indexes known to be related to changes in MPs: Carbonyl Index (CI), Hydroxyl Index (HI), and Carbon-Oxygen Index (COI). The overall results showed that the regions reflecting changes (hydroxyl groups, peaks from 3100 to 3700 cm\u22121, alkenes or carbon double bonds, 1600 and 1680 cm\u22121, and carbonyl groups, 1690 and 1810 cm\u22121) appeared significantly modified in artificial and natural weathered particles compared to the pristine materials. The indexes calculated for polymers degraded under the artificial photo and thermo ageing conditions displayed a general tendency to increase with the time in contact with irradiation time. Particular enhancements of CI of PS fragment and PE pellet, HI of PE and PS fragments and PE pellet, and COI of PS fragment were observed. Otherwise, the following incubation of the same particles at a constant temperature of 45 \u00b0C did not further affect the chemical composition of the particles. Moreover, new unique peaks were also observed in the freshwater particles, almost all in the fingerprint region (1500\u2013500 cm\u22121). Differences in CI, HI, and COI were evidenced among the different morphological MP shapes. On the one hand, the CI calculated for the environmental PE pellets showed values ranging from 0.05 to 0.26 with a mean value of 0.17 \u00b1 0.10. Most samples (57%) presented a CI with values between 0.16 and 0.30. On the other hand, fragments presented slicer modifications in the carbonyl region with CI values lower than pellets (0.05 \u00b1 0.05). This index helps evaluate the degradation of PE MPs by UV light, increasing with enhancing residence time in the environment. Conversely, fragments showed greater values of HI (5.90 \u00b1 2.57) and COI (1.04 \u00b1 0.48) than pellets, as well as lines, which presented the maximum value of HI (11.51). HI is attributed to the bond vibrations of hydroxyl, carboxyl, or phenol groups. In contrast, COI is frequently attributed to the vibrations of C_O bonds found in carbohydrates, alkanes, secondary alcohols, and ketones.

Polyethylene pellets were collected from La Pineda beach near Tarragona, Spain, and categorized by chemical composition and yellowing index, an indicator of aging. The hydrophilicity of these pellets was assessed using contact angle measurements. Microplastics were produced by grinding and filtering these pellets and subsequently dispersed around a free-standing lipid bilayer within a 3D microfluidic chip to investigate their interactions. Our results reveal that aged microplastics exhibit a significantly increased adhesive interaction with lipid bilayers, leading to greater bilayer stretching.

MPs and NPs originate from primary sources, such as cosmetic microspheres or synthetic fibers, and secondary fragmentation of larger plastics through environmental degradation. These particles, typically less than 5 mm, are found globally, from deep seabeds to human tissues, and are known to adsorb and release harmful pollutants, exacerbating ecological and health risks. Effective detection and quantification of MPs and NPs are essential for understanding and mitigating their impacts. Current analytical methods include physical and chemical techniques. Physical methods, such as optical and electron microscopy, provide morphological details but often lack specificity and are time-intensive. Chemical analyses, such as Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy, offer molecular specificity but face challenges with smaller particle sizes and complex matrices. Thermal analytical methods, including pyrolysis gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS), provide compositional insights but are destructive and limited in morphological analysis. Emerging (bio)sensing technologies show promise in addressing these challenges. Electrochemical biosensors offer cost-effective, portable, and sensitive platforms, leveraging principles such as voltammetry and impedance to detect MPs and their adsorbed pollutants. Plasmonic techniques, including surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), provide high sensitivity and specificity through nanostructure-enhanced detection. Fluorescent biosensors utilizing microbial or enzymatic elements enable the real-time monitoring of plastic degradation products, such as terephthalic acid from polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Advancements in these innovative approaches pave the way for more accurate, scalable, and environmentally compatible detection solutions, contributing to improved monitoring and remediation strategies.

Previous studies have indicated that MPs produce toxic effects on a variety of organs in aquatic organisms and mammals. However, the exact neurotoxicity of MPs in mammals is still unclear. Objectives: We aimed to confirm the neurotoxicity of chronic exposure to polystyrene MPs (PS-MPs) at environmental pollution concentrations. Methods: In the present study, mice were provided drinking water containing 100\u03bcg/L and 1,000\u03bcg/L PS-MPs with diameters of 0.5, 4, and 10\u03bcm for 180 consecutive days.

The accumulation of PS-MPs in brain tissues, integrity of the blood\u2013brain barrier, inflammation, and spine density were detected. We evaluated learning and memory ability by the Morris water maze and novel object recognition tests. Results: We observed the accumulation of PS-MPs with various particle diameters (0.5, 4, and 10\u03bcm) in the brains of exposed mice. Meanwhile, exposed mice also exhibited disruption of the blood\u2013brain barrier, lower level of dendritic spine density, and an inflammatory response in the hippocampus.

The obtained hemodynamic consequences are graphically represented with the variations of emerging parameters. These are significantly influenced by the rheological factors of the nanofluid flow, improving flow velocity with changes in shear viscosity, while a decrease in flow is observed for intensified Lorentz forces. Ciliary motion accelerates the expansion of the induced magnetic field on nanolayers, while a higher Magnetic Reynolds number decreases the current density distribution. Increased radiative heat generation lowers the temperature, indicating that thermal radiation enhances heat transfer and improves cooling efficiency. In contrast, an increased ciliary length along the wall raises the temperature due to wave-like motion, which strengthens the thermal boundary layer in the fluid flow. Additionally, a higher nanoparticle concentration increases wall shear stress due to frictional forces, while enhanced magnetic forces decrease the shear stress along the ciliary wall.

Chronic or excessive neuroinflammation can lead to neurotoxicity, causing brain damage and contributing to the onset and progression of various brain diseases. Therefore, understanding neuroinflammation mechanisms and developing strategies to control them is crucial for treating brain diseases. Studies have shown that neuroinflammation plays a vital role in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer\u2019s (AD) and Parkinson\u2019s (PD), and stroke. Additionally, the effects of PM2.5 pollution on the brain, including neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity, are well-documented. Quercetin is a flavonoid, a plant pigment in many fruits, vegetables, and grains. Quercetin has been studied for its potential health benefits, including its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-cancer properties. Quercetin may also have a positive impact on immune function and allergy symptoms. In addition, quercetin has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties and can activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a cellular energy sensor that modulates inflammation and oxidative stress. By reducing inflammation and protecting against neuroinflammatory toxicity, quercetin holds promise as a safe and effective adjunctive therapy for treating neurodegenerative diseases and other brain disorders. Understanding and controlling the mechanisms of NF-\u03baB and NLRP3 inflammasome pathways are crucial for preventing and treating conditions, and quercetin may be a promising tool in this effort.

Chemotherapy agents, like paclitaxel (PTX), damage the somatosensory nervous system by inducing neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, resulting in the sensitization of sensory neurons. Quercetin (QCT), known for its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective properties, is investigated for various neurological disorders. This work creates phenylboronic acid-modified hyaluronic acid (HA-PBA) gels with incorporated QCT and fabricates a double-layer microneedle (MN) patch using an HA-PBA-QCT complex in the needles and HA/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as the substrate. The crosslinking between PVA and HA-PBA-QCT enables a controlled, sustained release of QCT upon application. This work applies these QCT-loaded microneedle (QMN) patches to the instep skin of PTX-treated mice, which exhibits mechanical allodynia and cold hyperalgesia. Biweekly applications of the QMN patches significantly reduce pain responses. This analgesic effect is associated with the modulation of satellite glial cell activity, decreased macrophage infiltration, and reduced TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 levels in dorsal root ganglia (DRGs).

The pressure to feed nearly 8 billion people while maintaining a minimal impact on the environment has prompted a movement toward new, more sustainable food sources. For thousands of years, both the macro (seaweed and kelp) and micro (unicellular) forms of algae have been cultivated as a food source. Algae have evolved to be highly efficient at resource utilization and have proven to be a viable source of nutritious biomass that could address many of the current food production issues. Particularly for microalgae, studies of their large-scale growth and cultivation come from the biofuel industry; however, this knowledge can be reasonably translated into the production of algae-based food products. The ability of algae to sequester CO2 lends to its sustainability by helping to reduce the carbon footprint of its production. Additionally, algae can be produced on non-arable land using non-potable water (including brackish or seawater), which allows them to complement rather than compete with traditional agriculture. Algae inherently have the desired qualities of a sustainable food source because they produce highly digestible proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates, and are rich in essential fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals. Although algae have yet to be fully domesticated as food sources, a variety of cultivation and breeding tools exist that can be built upon to allow for the increased productivity and enhanced nutritional and organoleptic qualities that will be required to bring algae to mainstream utilization.

Materials and Methods This process-based life cycle assessment (LCA) of a diagnostic radiology department serving adult inpatient, outpatient, and emergency department patients in a U.S. hospital followed International Organization for Standardization (ISO 14040:2006) guidelines. System components included production and distribution of imaging equipment; energy use of imaging equipment, including MRI, CT, radiography and fluoroscopy, and US; production and use of other capital equipment; production of single-use, semidurable, and durable supplies and linens; and production and energy use from onsite data storage. Meters monitored the power usage of selected imaging equipment during April 2023. Modeling assumed an equipment lifespan of 10 years. Results are reported in kilotons of CO2 equivalent (kt CO2e) emissions per scan and over a 10-year period. A sensitivity analysis assessed variability of data. Results Over a decade, these radiology services generated 4.6 kt CO2e GHG emissions, with MRI responsible for 48% (2.2 of 4.6 kt CO2e) and CT responsible for 24% (1.1 of 4.6 kt CO2e) of cumulative emissions. Clinical use of imaging equipment (all modalities) accounted for 54% of departmental GHGs (2.5 of 4.6 kt CO2e).

Not only does telemedicine contribute to improved patient quality of life and satisfaction by reducing travel time and allowing patients to be seen in their usual environment, but it also has the potential to improve disease management by making it easier for patients to see a doctor. Recently, owing to IT developments, research on telemedicine has been increasing; however, its usefulness and limitations in randomized controlled trials remain unclear because of the multifaceted effects of telemedicine. Furthermore, the specific metrics that can be used as cross-disciplinary indicators when comparing telemedicine and face-to-face care also remain undefined. Objective This review aimed to provide an overview of the general and cross-disciplinarity metrics used to compare telemedicine with in-person care in randomized controlled trials. In addition, we identified previously unevaluated indicators and suggested those that should be prioritized in future clinical trials. Methods MEDLINE and Embase databases were searched for publications that met the inclusion criteria according to PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Extension for Scoping Reviews). Original, English-language articles on randomized controlled trials comparing some forms of telemedicine with face-to-face care from January 2019 to March 2024 were included, and the basic information and general metrics used in these studies were summarized. Results Of the 2275 articles initially identified, 79 were included in the final analysis. The commonly used metrics that can be used across medical specialties were divided into the following 3 categories: (1) patient-centeredness (67/79, 85%), including patient satisfaction, workload, and quality of life; (2) patient outcomes (57/79, 72%), including general clinical parameters such as death, admission, and adverse events; and (3) cost-effectiveness (40/79, 51%), including cost assessment and quality-adjusted life year. Notably, only 25 (32%) of 79 studies evaluated all the 3 categories. Other metrics, such as staff convenience, system usability, and environmental impact, were extracted as indicators in different directions from the three categories above, although few previous reports have evaluated them (staff convenience: 8/79, 10%; system usability: 3/79, 4%; and environmental impact: 2/79, 3%). Conclusions A significant variation was observed in the metrics used across previous studies. Notably, general indicators should be used to enhance the understandability of the results for people in other areas, even if disease-specific indicators are used. In addition, indicators should be established to include all three commonly used categories of measures to ensure a comprehensive evaluation: patient-centeredness, patient outcomes, and cost-effectiveness. Staff convenience, system usability, and environmental impact are important indicators that should be used in future trials. Moreover, standardization of the evaluation metrics is desired for future clinical trials and studies.

Using the comprehensive German Agricultural Soil Inventory, we selected 189 samples with a wide range of SOC (5\u2013118\u2009g\u2009kg\u22121) and clay contents (30\u2013770\u2009g\u2009kg\u22121) to test whether there is a detectable upper limit of MAOC content. We found that the proportion of MAOC was surprisingly stable for soils under cropland and grassland use across the whole range of bulk SOC contents. Soil texture influenced the slope of the relationship between bulk SOC and MAOC, but no upper limit was observed in any texture class. Also, C content in the fine fraction (g\u2009C\u2009kg\u22121 fraction) was negatively correlated to fine fraction content (g\u2009kg\u22121 bulk soil).

In an evaluation of surface soils (0\u2010 to 10\u2010cm depth) under consistently undisturbed land use from 648 sites across relatively narrow climatic variations in North Carolina, large soil texture variations were assembled into structured populations (n\u00a0=\u00a027) of sand and clay categories (n\u00a0=\u00a024).

Drinking-water exposures to per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a national concern, however, there is limited information on PFAS in residential tapwater at the point-of-use, especially from private-wells. We conducted a national reconnaissance to compare human PFAS exposures in unregulated private-well and regulated public-supply tapwater. Tapwater from 716 locations (269 private-wells; 447 public supply) across the US was collected during 2016-2021 including three locations where temporal sampling was conducted.

Seventeen PFAS were observed at least once with PFBS, PFHxS and PFOA observed most frequently in approximately 15% of the samples.

We estimate that at least one PFAS could be detected in about 45% of US drinking-water samples. These detection probabilities varied spatially with limited temporal variation in concentrations/numbers of PFAS detected. Benchmark screening approaches indicated potential human exposure risk was dominated by PFOA and PFOS, when detected.

Measurements were carried out in solutions having variable (acidic) pH and in solutions buffered to pH = 8.0. Surface tension data show traditional soluble surfactant behavior, and results illustrate that PFOA, PFBS, and PFOS surface activity depends sensitively on solution phase pH. The tightly packed monolayers formed by PFOA in mildly acidic solutions imply that the surface pH of PFOA solutions is several units lower than bulk. Results from conductivity experiments generally show increasing conductivity with increasing bulk solution surfactant concentration. In pH = 8.0 solutions, changes in conductivity slope with surfactant concentration suggest the onset of micelle formation at concentrations <1 mM, markedly lower than reported in literature. In general, apparent critical micelle concentrations (CMCs) determined from conductivity data agree with similar predictions made from surface tension results. DLS measurements show that at concentrations close to the predicted PFAS CMCs, objects with diameters \u226410 nm start to form. However, unlike micelles, these objects continue to grow with increasing bulk solute concentration. These aggregates form structures having diameters of 50-150 nm. Aggregate size shrinks modestly as solution phase temperature increases, and this behavior is reversible. Cryo-EM images of PFOA solutions confirm a broad distribution of particles, supporting the DLS measurements.

Here, two MP types\u2500polyamide (PA) and polylactic acid (PLA)\u2500were aged by UV irradiation, and the adsorption and desorption behaviors of MPs on Cr(VI) were studied. The results indicated that UV light can rapidly age MPs.

The aged MPs depicted a markedly enhanced adsorption capacity for Cr(VI) compared with the results of aged-PA > pristine-PA > aged-PLA > pristine-PLA. The process followed the Langmuir and pseudo-second-order models, confirming that chemical and monolayer adsorption are the primary processes involved in the adsorption of Cr(VI) by aged MPs. Cr(VI) was more easily desorbed in the simulated gastric fluid environment. The desorption rate of aged MPs was lower than that of pristine MPs because of their stronger binding forces to Cr(VI). The binding of Cr(VI) to MPs mainly depends on synergistic mechanisms such as electrostatic attraction, reduction reactions, and chelation of oxygenic groups.

It is also expected that in the future the entire world population may rapidly increase and will surely demand more food. Farmers now utilize a massive quantity of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides for disease management and to increase food production. These synthetic fertilizers badly affect the environment, the texture of the soil, plant productivity, and human health. However, agricultural safety and sustainability depend on an ecofriendly and inexpensive biological application. In contrast to synthetic fertilizers, soil inoculation with plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) is one of the excellent alternative options. In this regard, we focused on the best PGPR genera, Pseudomonas, which exists in the rhizosphere as well as inside the plant\u2019s body and plays a role in sustainable agriculture. Many Pseudomonas spp. control plant pathogens and play an effective role in disease management through direct and indirect mechanisms. Pseudomonas spp. fix the amount of atmospheric nitrogen, solubilize phosphorus and potassium, and also produce phytohormones, lytic enzymes, volatile organic compounds, antibiotics, and secondary metabolites during stress conditions. These compounds stimulate plant growth by inducing systemic resistance and by inhibiting the growth of pathogens. Furthermore, pseudomonads also protect plants during different stress conditions like heavy metal pollution, osmosis, temperature, oxidative stress, etc. Now, several Pseudomonas-based commercial biological control products have been promoted and marketed, but there are a few limitations that hinder the development of this technology for extensive usage in agricultural systems. The variability among the members of Pseudomonas spp. draws attention to the huge research interest in this genus.

Pseudomonas spp., ubiquitous in soil ecosystems and root microbiomes, have attracted attention for their ability to suppress phytopathogens and enhance plant health through various mechanisms. These include direct competition for nutrients, production of antimicrobial compounds and volatile organic compounds, competition using type VI secretion systems, and indirect induction of systemic resistance. Our review shows that Pseudomonas strains effectively control a wide range of diseases across diverse plant species, with some strains demonstrating efficacy comparable to chemical fungicides. However, the review also highlights challenges in achieving consistent performance when using Pseudomonas inoculants under field conditions due to various biotic and abiotic factors. Strategies to optimize biocontrol potential, such as formulation techniques, application methods, and integration with other management practices, are discussed. The advantages of Pseudomonas-based biocontrol for sustainable agriculture include reduced reliance on chemical pesticides, enhanced crop productivity, and improved environmental sustainability.

The Earth Cloud, Aerosol and Radiation Explorer (EarthCARE) is a satellite mission implemented by the European Space Agency (ESA), in cooperation with the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), to measure global profiles of aerosols, clouds and precipitation properties together with radiative fluxes and derived heating rates. The simultaneous measurements of the vertical structure and horizontal distribution of cloud and aerosol fields, together with outgoing radiation, will be used in particular to evaluate their representation in weather forecasting and climate models and to improve our understanding of cloud and aerosol radiative impact and feedback mechanisms.

The scientific payload consists of four instruments: an atmospheric lidar, a cloud-profiling radar with Doppler capability, a multi-spectral imager and a broadband radiometer. Co-located measurements from these instruments are processed in the ground segment, which produces and distributes a wide range of science data products. As well as the Level\u00a01 (L1) product of each instrument, a large number of multiple-instrument L2 products have been developed, in both Europe and Japan, benefiting from the data synergy. An end-to-end simulator and several test scenes have been developed that simulate EarthCARE observations and provide a development and test environment for L1 and L2 processors.

This study developed an algorithm for the Level\u00a02 (L2) atmospheric radiation flux and heating rate product by a Japanese team for Earth Cloud, Aerosol and Radiation Explorer (EarthCARE). This product offers vertical profiles of downward and upward longwave (LW) and shortwave (SW) radiative fluxes and their atmospheric heating rates. This paper describes the algorithm developed for generating products, including the atmospheric radiative transfer model and input datasets, and its validation against measurement data of radiative fluxes. In the testing phase before the EarthCARE launch, we utilized A-Train data that provided input and output variables analogous to EarthCARE, so that the developed algorithm could be directly applied to EarthCARE after its launch. The results include comparisons of radiative fluxes between radiative transfer simulations and satellite and ground-based observations that quantify errors in computed radiative fluxes at the top of the atmosphere against Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) observations and their dependence on cloud type with varying thermodynamic phases. For SW fluxes, the bias was 24.4\u2009W\u2009m\u22122, and the root mean square error (RMSE) was 36.3\u2009W\u2009m\u22122 relative to the CERES observations at spatial and temporal scales of 5\u00b0 and 1\u00a0month, respectively. On the other hand, LW exhibits a bias of \u221210.7\u2009W\u2009m\u22122 and an RMSE of 14.2\u2009W\u2009m\u22122. When considering different cloud phases, the SW water cloud exhibited a bias of \u221211.7\u2009W\u2009m\u22122 and an RMSE of 46.2\u2009W\u2009m\u22122, while the LW showed a bias of 0.8\u2009W\u2009m\u22122 and an RMSE of 6.0\u2009W\u2009m\u22122. When ice clouds were included, the SW bias ranged from 58.7 to 81.5\u2009W\u2009m\u22122 and the RMSE from 72.8 to 91.6\u2009W\u2009m\u22122 depending on the ice-containing cloud types, while the corresponding LW bias ranged from \u22128.8 to \u221228.4\u2009W\u2009m\u22122 and the RMSE from 25.9 to 31.8\u2009W\u2009m\u22122, indicating that the primary source of error was ice-containing clouds. The comparisons were further extended to various spatiotemporal scales to investigate the scale dependency of the flux errors. The SW component of this product exhibited an RMSE of approximately 30\u2009W\u2009m\u22122 at spatial and temporal scales of 40\u00b0 and 40\u2009d, respectively, whereas the LW component did not show a significant decrease in RMSE with increasing spatiotemporal scale. Radiative transfer simulations were also compared with ground-based observations of the surface downward SW and LW radiative fluxes at selected locations. The results show that the bias and RMSE for SW are \u221217.6 and 172.0\u2009W\u2009m\u22122, respectively, which are larger than those for LW that are \u22125.6 and 19.0\u2009W\u2009m\u22122, respectively.\n", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-11-28", "synthetic_support_claim": "The primary source of error in radiative flux computations is ice-containing clouds.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "The algorithm can accurately predict atmospheric radiative fluxes for all cloud types, including ice-containing clouds."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "15c2704d422817f739fee0ac202cbfc4b1bc05cb", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/15c2704d422817f739fee0ac202cbfc4b1bc05cb", "title": "A satellite-based analysis of semi-direct effects of biomass burning aerosols on fog and low-cloud dissipation in the Namib Desert", "abstract": "Abstract. In the Namib Desert, fog is the only regular water input and, thus, is a crucial water source for its fauna and flora. Each year, between June and October, absorbing biomass burning aerosols (BBAs) overlie the stratocumulus clouds in the adjacent Southeast Atlantic. In some synoptic settings, this layer of BBAs reaches Namibia and its desert, where it interacts with coastal fog and low clouds (FLCs). In this study, a novel 15-year data set of geostationary satellite observations of FLC dissipation time in the Namib Desert is used, along with reanalysis data, to better understand the potential semi-direct effects of BBAs on FLC dissipation in the Namib Desert, i.e., through adjustments of atmospheric stability and thermodynamics via the interaction of aerosols with radiation. This is done by investigating both the time of day when FLCs dissolve and the synoptic-scale meteorology depending on BBA loading. It is found that FLC dissipation time is significantly later on high-BBA-loading days. BBAs are transported to the Namib along moist free-tropospheric air by a large-scale anticyclonic recirculation pattern. At the surface, the associated longwave heating strengthens a continental heat low, which modifies the circulation and boundary layer moisture along the coastline, complicating the attribution of BBA effects. During high-BBA days, the vertical profiles of the temporal development of air temperatures highlight contrasting daytime and nighttime processes modifying the local inversion. These processes are thought to be driven by greenhouse warming as a result of the moisture in the BBA plumes and BBA absorption (only during the daytime). A statistical learning framework is used to quantify meteorological and BBA influences on FLC dissipation time. The statistical model is able to reproduce the observed differences in FLC dissipation time between high- and low-BBA days and attributes these differences mainly to differences in circulation, boundary layer moisture and near-surface air temperature along the coastline. However, the model is prone to underfitting and is not able to reproduce the majority of the FLC dissipation variability. While the model does not suggest that BBA patterns are important for FLC dissipation, the findings show how the moist BBA plumes modify local thermodynamics, to which FLC dissipation is shown to be sensitive. The findings highlight the challenges of disentangling meteorological and aerosol effects on cloud development using observations and invite detailed modeling analyses of the underlying processes, for example, with large-eddy simulations.\n", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-01-15", "synthetic_support_claim": "Fog and low clouds in the Namib Desert dissipate significantly later on high-biomass-burning-aerosol days.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "BBAs have no effect on FLC dissipation time in the Namib Desert."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "4d8a3771ef7c336b0088fb91ff7125d7ac3d66b4", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4d8a3771ef7c336b0088fb91ff7125d7ac3d66b4", "title": "Addressing chemical pollution in biodiversity research", "abstract": "Climate change, biodiversity loss, and chemical pollution are planetary\u2010scale emergencies requiring urgent mitigation actions.

Instead, it serves as a basis for regulatory obligations in other specific regulations. This study investigates the regulatory implications of meeting hazard criteria under the CLP across EU regulations and directives listed in EU Chemicals Legislation Finder (EUCLEF). The results show that fulfilling criteria for human health hazard classes trigger regulatory obligations in the highest number of regulations/directives, with carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, and reproductive toxicity (CMR) leading to obligations in 19 of 20 pieces of legislation linked to the CLP.

Previous studies indicate that one of the benefits of cover crop use is the increase in the activity of enzymes in the soil. Some enzymes are also responsible for breaking down herbicide molecules. The biodegradation of herbicides in the soil is a natural process that leads to a reduction in the concentration of the parent compound overtime. Although cover crop use can result in the increased activity of soil enzymes, to date, there is no evidence that such increased activity also leads to a reduced persistence of residual herbicides in the soil. However, cover crop use does alter the fate of residual herbicides by interception, with some studies reporting more than 90% interception. Without rainfall or irrigation during the days following its application, the herbicide remains on the plant surface and is ineffective as a weed control tool. Following the integrated weed management approach, the combination of cover crop and soil residual herbicides is a promising alternative to delay the development of new herbicide resistance cases. However, more research is needed to understand the impact of biomass accumulation on residual herbicide fate and to determine the best strategies to improve herbicide placement on cover cropping system.

Early dominant pioneer communities of the plastisphere belong to primary producers, including diatoms, cyanobacteria, green algae and bacterial members of the Gammaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria.

Factors driving the plastisphere composition include environmental conditions and polymers, with the former having a much larger influence on the microbial community composition than polymers.

While several studies are documenting the spread of plastic pollution in the Ross Sea, whether the formation of a plastisphere (namely the complex microbial assemblage colonizing plastics) may favor the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) in this marine environment is unknown yet. A colonization experiment was performed in this ecosystem, aiming at exploring the potential role of plastic polymers as a reservoir of antibiotic resistance. To this end, the biofilm-producing activity and the antibiotic susceptibility profiles of bacterial strains isolated from biofilms colonizing submerged polyvinylchloride and polyethylene panels were screened. The colonization experiment was carried out at two different sites of the Ross Sea, namely Road Bay and Tethys Bay. Most of bacterial isolates were able to produce biofilm; several multidrug resistances were detected in the bacterial members of biofilms associated to PVC and PE (also named as the plastisphere), as well as in the bacterial strains isolated from the surrounding water. The lowest percentage of ARB was found in the PE-associated plastisphere from the not-impacted (control) Punta Stocchino station, whereas the highest one was detected in the PVC-associated plastisphere from the Tethys Bay station. However, no selective enrichment of ARB in relation to the study sites or to either type of plastic material was observed, suggesting that resistance to antibiotics was a generalized widespread phenomenon. Resistance against to all the three classes of antibiotics assayed in this study (i.e., cell wall antibiotics, nucleic acids, and protein synthesis inhibitors) was observed.

This realization identified plastic pollution as one of the major global environmental issues. Majorities of plastic debris are neither recycled nor incinerated, as a result, it eventually makes its way into lakes, rivers, and oceans. Analysis of water and sediment worldwide indicates that microplastics and nanoplastic are ubiquitous in soils, freshwater, and marine ecosystems. Microplastic and nanoplastics are distributed throughout marine environments via processes such as biofouling and chemical leaching, contaminating both pelagic and benthic species. Despite growing recognition of the hazards posed by microplastics and nanoplastics, regulatory efforts remain hampered by limited understanding of their broader ecological impacts, particularly how diverse factors translate into population declines and ecosystem disruptions. This review examines the pathways of microplastic and nanoplastic pollution, their interactions with other environmental stressors such as climate change and chemical pollution, and their effects on marine food webs. The review highlights the urgent need for further research into the behavior and fate of nanoplastics, which are the degradation product of microplastics, owing to their nano size they pose additional risks, unique properties, and potential for widespread ecological impacts. Studies have demonstrated that smaller microplastics and nanoplastics, particularly nanoplastics, are more toxic than larger microplastics. Additionally, microplastics and nanoplastics serve as vectors for contaminants such as heavy metals, exacerbating their toxicity. They also translocate through marine food chains, posing potential health risks. While evidence of their impact continues to grow, the chronic toxicity of microplastics and nanoplastics remains poorly understood, emphasizing the need for further research, particularly at the cellular level, to fully understand their effects on marine ecosystems and human health. This review also concludes with a call for standardized measurement methods, effective mitigation strategies, and enhanced international cooperation to combat this escalating threat. Future research should prioritize the complex interactions between microplastics and nanoplastics, other pollutants, and marine ecosystems, with the ultimate goal of developing holistic approaches to manage and mitigate the impact of plastic pollution.

Petroleum-based plastic polymers, with their remarkable range of physical properties, have revolutionized industries worldwide. Their versatility\u2014from flexible to rigid and hydrophilic to hydrophobic\u2014has fueled an ever-growing demand. However, their versatility has also contributed to a massive global waste problem as plastics pervade virtually every ecosystem, from the depths of oceans to the most remote terrestrial landscapes. Plastic pollution manifests not just as visible waste\u2014such as fishing nets, bottles, and garbage bags\u2014but also as microplastics, infiltrating food chains and freshwater sources. This crisis is exacerbated by the unsustainable linear model of plastic production and consumption, which prioritizes convenience over long-term environmental health. The mismanagement of plastic waste not only pollutes ecosystems but also releases greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide during degradation and incineration, thereby complicating efforts to achieve global climate and sustainability goals. Given that mechanical recycling only addresses a fraction of macroplastics, innovative approaches are needed to improve this process. Methods like pyrolysis and hydrogenolysis offer promising solutions by enabling the chemical transformation and depolymerization of plastics into reusable materials or valuable chemical feedstocks. These advanced recycling methods can support a circular economy by reducing waste and creating high-value products. In this article, the focus on pyrolysis and hydrogenolysis underscores the need to move beyond traditional recycling. These methods exemplify the potential for science and technology to mitigate plastic pollution while aligning with sustainability objectives. Recent advances in the pyrolysis and hydrogenolysis of polyolefins focus on their potential for advanced recycling, breaking down plastics at a molecular level to create feedstocks for new products or fuels. Pyrolysis produces pyrolysis oil and syngas, with applications in renewable energy and chemicals. However, some challenges of this process include scalability, feedstock variety, and standardization, as well as environmental concerns about emissions. Companies like Shell and ExxonMobil are investing heavily to overcome these barriers and improve recycling efficiencies. By leveraging these transformative strategies, we can reimagine the lifecycle of plastics and address one of the most pressing environmental challenges of our time.

The production of crops affects the economy of a country to a great extent. In agriculture, observing the soil, weather, and water availability and, based on these factors, selecting an appropriate crop, finding the availability of seeds, analysing crop demand in the market, and having knowledge of crop cultivation are important. At present, many advancements have been made in recent times, starting from crop selection to crop cutting. Mainly, the roles of the Internet of Things, cloud computing, and machine learning tools help a farmer to analyse and make better decisions in each stage of cultivation. Once suitable crop seeds are chosen, the farmer shall proceed with seeding, monitoring crop growth, disease detection, finding the ripening stage of the crop, and then crop cutting. The main objective is to provide a continuous support system to a farmer so that he can obtain regular inputs about his field and crop. Additionally, he should be able to make proper decisions at each stage of farming. Artificial intelligence, machine learning, the cloud, sensors, and other automated devices shall be included in the decision support system so that it will provide the right information within a short time span. By using the support system, a farmer will be able to take decisive measures without fully depending on the local agriculture offices. We have proposed an IoT-enabled soil nutrient classification and crop recommendation (IoTSNA-CR) model to recommend crops. The model helps to minimise the use of fertilisers in soil so as to maximise productivity. The proposed model consists of phases, such as data collection using IoT sensors from cultivation lands, storing this real-time data into cloud memory services, accessing this cloud data using an Android application, and then pre-processing and periodic analysis of it using different learning techniques. A sensory system was prepared with optimised cost that contains different sensors, such as a soil temperature sensor, a soil moisture sensor, a water level indicator, a pH sensor, a GPS sensor, and a colour sensor, along with an Arduino UNO board. This sensory system allowed us to collect moisture, temperature, water level, soil NPK colour values, date, time, longitude, and latitude. The studies have revealed that the Agrinex NPK soil testing tablets should be applied to a soil sample, and then the soil colour can be sensed using an LDR colour sensor to predict the phosphorus (P), nitrogen (N), and potassium (K) values. These collected data together were stored in Firebase cloud storage media. Then, an Android application was developed to fetch and analyse the data from the Firebase cloud service from time to time by a farmer. In this study, a novel approach was identified via the hybridisation of algorithms. We have developed an algorithm using a multi-class support vector machine with a directed acyclic graph and optimised it using the fruit fly optimisation method (MSVM-DAG-FFO). The highest accuracy rate of this algorithm is 0.973, compared to 0.932 for SVM, 0.922 for SVM kernel, and 0.914 for decision tree. It has been observed that the overall performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of accuracy, recall, precision, and F-Score is high compared to other methods. The IoTSNA-CR device allows the farmer to maintain his field soil information easily in the cloud service using his own mobile with minimum knowledge.

Using mobile technology for paper sensor readout could, in principle, enable the application of machine-learning models for transforming colorimetric data into threshold-based classes that represent chemical concentration. Such a classification method could provide a basis for soil management decisions where high-resolution lab analysis is not required or available. In tropical regions, where reliable soil data is difficult to acquire, this approach would be particularly useful.

A standard smartphone equipped with a dedicated software application automatically classifies the paper sensor results into three classes\u2014low, medium, or high soil pH\u2014which provides a basis for soil correction. The classification task is performed by a machine-learning model which was trained on the colorimetric pH indicators deployed on the paper sensor. By mapping topsoil pH on a test site with an area of 9 hectares, the mobile system was benchmarked in the field against standard soil lab analysis. The mobile system has correctly classified soil pH in 97% of test cases, while reducing the analysis turnaround time from days (soil lab) to minutes (mobile).

However, the specific potential of modulators such as melatonin, chitosan, humic acid, and selenium in enhancing the resistance of ajwain (Carum copticum L.) plants to water scarcity remains an open question. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a randomized, field block-designed factorial experiment over two years (2022\u20132023) to compare the effectiveness of these biostimulants in mitigating the impact of water shortage on ajwain plants. This study involved three irrigation regimes: 100% field water capacity (FC100%\u2014unstressed), 75% irrigation deficit (FC75%\u2014moderate) and 50% irrigation deficit (FC50%\u2014severe), and four modifier treatments (melatonin, chitosan, humic acid, selenium), plus untreated controls. Plant growth, seed yields, essential oil production, as well as eco-physiological traits were studied to assess the efficacy of these compounds as stress modulators. Water regimes and stress modifier applications, as a single factor or in synergy, significantly affected plant physiology and seed yield, highlighting the importance of sustainability in agricultural practices. Compared to FC100%, biological and seed yield, chlorophyll, and nutrient content decreased under FC75% and FC50%, while essential oil production, proline, soluble sugars, flavonoids, phenols and antioxidant enzymatic activity increased. Notably, regardless of the type of modulator used, the application of these modifiers improved all physiological attributes under moderate and severe irrigation deficits. Among the involved compounds, melatonin induced the most pronounced effects, leading to higher biological and seed yield, essential and fixed oil production, relative leaf water content, chlorophyll and nutrient concentration, and antioxidant activity.

Results showed that this shared socioeconomic pathway is likely to affect vector-borne diseases.

Abstract Arboviral mosquito vectors are key targets for the surveillance and control of vector-borne diseases worldwide. In recent years, changes to the global distributions of these species have been a major research focus, aimed at predicting outbreaks of arboviral diseases. In this study, we analyzed a global scenario of climate change under regional rivalry to predict changes to these species\u2019 distributions over the next century. Using occurrence data from VectorMap and environmental variables (temperature and precipitation) from WorldClim v. 2.1, we first built fundamental niche models for both species with the boosted regression tree modelling approach. A scenario of climate change on their fundamental niche was then analyzed. The shared socioeconomic pathway scenario 3 (regional rivalry) and the global climate model Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Earth System Model v. 4.1 (GFDL-ESM4.1; gfdl.noaa.gov) were utilized for all analyses, in the following time periods: 2021\u20132040, 2041\u20132060, 2061\u20132080, and 2081\u20132100. Outcomes from these analyses showed that future climate change will affect Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus distributions in different ways across the globe. The Northern Hemisphere will have extended Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus distributions in future climate change scenarios, whereas the Southern Hemisphere will have the opposite outcomes. Europe will become more suitable for both species and their related vector-borne diseases.

KPSC members aged 60 years or older were eligible for inclusion. Members were excluded if they did not meet eligibility criteria, if they had a dementia diagnosis before cohort entry, or if EHR data lacked address information. Data analysis was conducted from May 2023 to May 2024.\n\n\nExposures\nThree-year rolling mean wildfire and nonwildfire PM2.5 in member census tracts from January 2006 to December 2019, updated quarterly and estimated via monitoring and remote-sensing data and statistical techniques.\n\n\nMain Outcome and Measures\nThe primary outcome was incident dementia, identified using diagnostic codes in the EHR. Odds of dementia diagnoses associated with 3-year mean wildfire and nonwildfire PM2.5 exposure were estimated using a discrete-time approach with pooled logistic regression. Models adjusted for age, sex, race and ethnicity (considered as a social construct rather than as a biological determinant), marital status, smoking status, calendar year, and census tract-level poverty and population density. Stratified models assessed effect measure modification by age, sex, race and ethnicity, and census tract-level poverty.\n\n\nResults\nAmong 1.64 million KPSC members aged 60 years or older during the study period, 1\u202f223\u202f107 members were eligible for inclusion in this study. The study population consisted of 644\u202f766 female members (53.0%). In total, 319\u202f521 members identified as Hispanic (26.0%), 601\u202f334 members identified as non-Hispanic White (49.0%), and 80\u202f993 members received a dementia diagnosis during follow-up (6.6%). In adjusted models, a 1-\u03bcg/m3 increase in the 3-year mean of wildfire PM2.5 exposure was associated with an 18% increase in the odds of dementia diagnosis (odds ratio [OR], 1.18; 95% CI, 1.03-1.34). In comparison, a 1-\u03bcg/m3 increase in nonwildfire PM2.5 exposure was associated with a 1% increase (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.01-1.02). For wildfire PM2.5 exposure, associations were stronger among members less than 75 years old upon cohort entry, members from racially minoritized subgroups, and those living in high-poverty vs low-poverty census tracts.\n\n\nConclusions and Relevance\nIn this cohort study, after adjusting for measured confounders, long-term exposure to wildfire and nonwildfire PM2.5 over a 3-year period was associated with dementia diagnoses.

The inherent modularity of PCNs has enabled the development of crystal engineering strategies for systematic fine-tuning of pore size and chemistry in families of related PCNs. The same cannot be said about one-dimensional (1D) coordination polymers, CPs, which are understudied with respect to porosity. Here, we report that permanent porosity is exhibited by the previously reported family of linear (L) 1D porous CPs, PCPs, of formula [M(bipy)(NO3)2(H2O)2]n (L-chn-1-M-NO3: M = Co, Ni; bipy = 4,4\u2032-bipyridine). Their pore structure comprises 1D channels sustained by three types of directional interaction: coordination bonds; hydrogen bonds; offset \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interactions. Heating L-chn-1-M-NO3 in vacuo or above 383 K resulted in removal of the aqua ligands and concomitant transformation to nonporous anhydrate phases ZZ-chn-1-Co-NO3 (ZZ = zigzag) and HT-Ni. Exposure of these anhydrate phases to ambient humidity resulted in regeneration of L-chn-1-M-NO3. That L-chn-1-M-NO3 exhibits permanent porosity was supported by CO2 and water sorption measurements, which afforded reversible type I and stepped (S-shaped) isotherm profiles, respectively, making this work the first demonstration of reversible water sorption in a 1D PCP. The water sorption properties are pertinent to atmospheric water harvesting: onset of uptake at ca. 12% relative humidity; activation required only mild heat or vacuum; relatively fast adsorption/desorption kinetics; performance retained over >100 adsorption/desorption cycles. We project water harvesting productivity of L-chn-1-M-NO3 of 3.3 L kg\u20131 d\u20131, on par with some leading MOF desiccants. DFT and Monte Carlo simulations provide insights into the structure of water molecules in the channels, provide their influence on the host framework, and provide a plausible argument for the experimental water vapor isotherms.

Concurrent heat extremes over different regions have significantly increased in the Northern Hemisphere from 1950 to 2023.

Global warming is responsible for long\u2010term increases in the frequency and strength of concurrent heat extremes, with most pronounced impact in tropical regions.

This leap into atomic- and nanometer-scale measurements has uncovered scale-dependent phenomena whose reaction thermodynamics, kinetics, and pathways deviate from previous observations made on larger systems. A second key advance is new experimental evidence for what scientists hypothesized but could not test previously, namely, interfacial chemical reactions are frequently driven by \"anomalies\" or \"non-idealities\" such as defects, nanoconfinement, and other nontypical chemical structures. Third, progress in computational chemistry has yielded new insights that allow a move beyond simple schematics, leading to a molecular model of these complex interfaces. In combination with surface-sensitive measurements, we have gained knowledge of the interfacial structure and dynamics, including the underlying solid surface and the immediately adjacent water and aqueous ions, enabling a better definition of what constitutes the oxide- and silicate-water interfaces. This critical review discusses how science progresses from understanding ideal solid-water interfaces to more realistic systems, focusing on accomplishments in the last 20 years and identifying challenges and future opportunities for the community to address.

The surface nature and size of the impact allowed Kim et al. to detect surface waves from the event, which have yet to be observed on Mars. These surface waves help to untangle the structure of the Martian crust, which has various amounts of volcanic and sedimentary rock, along with subsurface ice, in different regions of the planet (see the Perspective by Yang and Chen).

Nowadays, urgent action is required for the development of advanced technologies aimed at capturing PFAS and mitigating their impact. To offer a solution, a functional 3D printed hydrogel tailored is designed to trap a broad spectrum of PFAS contaminants. The hydrogel is made of a photo\u2010crosslinked dimethacrylate\u2010ureido\u2010trianglamine (DMU\u2010\u0394) and Pluronic P123 dimethacrylate (PDM) fabricated by stereolithography (SLA). With the aid of 3D\u2010printing, porous and nonporous hydrogels (3D\u2010PSH\u0394, 3D\u2010SH\u0394) as well as quaternized hydrogels (3D\u2010PSH\u0394Q+ ) are prepared. These tailored hydrogels, show high uptake capacities and fast removal kinetics for PFAS from aqueous sources. The PFAS removal efficiency of these hydrogels are then compared to P123 hydrogels with no trianglamine (3D\u2010SH). The 3D\u2010SH hydrogel shows no affinity to PFAS, proving that the sorption is due to the interaction between the trianglamine (\u0394) and PFAS. Metadynamic simulations also confirmed this interaction. The porous matrices showed the fastest and highest uptake capacity. 3D\u2010PSH\u0394 is able to capture \u2248 91% of PFAS within 5 h using initial concentrations of 5 and 0.5 ppm in both deionized and river water. The sorption of PFAS is further enhanced by introducing permanent positive charges to the structure of the porous hydrogels, resulting in even faster sorption kinetics for both long and short PFAS chains with diverse polar heads. Besides the remarkable efficiency in capturing PFAS, these designed hydrogels are non\u2010toxic and have outstanding chemical and thermal stability, making them a brilliant candidate for mass use in the combat against PFAS pollution.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-11-21", "synthetic_support_claim": "3D\u2010printed hydrogel with trianglamine effectively captures \u2248 91% of PFAS within 5 hours in water.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "The 3D-printed hydrogel enables the complete removal of all PFAS contaminants from any water source."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "fb35af3689c57c4c34f8e922b22188a3308e8cc9", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fb35af3689c57c4c34f8e922b22188a3308e8cc9", "title": "Construction of Anthracene-based Metal-Organic Framework Exhibiting Enhanced Singlet Oxygen Storage and Release Capabilities for Efficient Photodegradation of Phenolic Pollutants.", "abstract": "Controlling the generation and release of singlet oxygen (1O2) with high oxidation activity and long lifetime properties holds significant potential for efficient oxidation of permanent organic pollutants, tumor eradication, and targeted molecular oxidation.

The research was carried out using a systematic literature review and comparative analysis and was mainly based on qualitative criteria. Following a literature review and data analysis, the paper identifies 65 energy security indicators (from over 300 possible indicators) that are relevant for the electricity sector. The work also highlights the indicators of energy security on which the state's economic decisions have a direct and indirect effect.

It shows how government economic choices can have both direct and indirect effects on energy outcomes, helping us understand the complex ways policies and energy results relate to each other. The paper argues that state interventions in areas such as public support for promotion of renewable energy sources and energy efficiency gains, and energy price regulation exert a significant effect on energy security in the electricity sector.

However, the global impact of management (for example, harvesting) on the carbon budget of forests remains poorly quantified. We integrated global maps of forest biomass and management with machine learning to show that by removing human intervention, under current climatic conditions and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration, existing global forests could increase their aboveground biomass by up to 44.1 (error range: 21.0 to 63.0) petagrams of carbon. This is an increase of 15 to 16% over current levels, equating to about 4 years of current anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Therefore, without strong reductions in emissions, this strategy holds low mitigation potential, and the forest sink should be preserved to offset residual carbon emissions rather than to compensate for present emissions levels.

Planting new forests is a common strategy, but this approach can have negative social and ecological impacts and substantial costs.

While Metabolic Scaling Theory (MST) offers a promising concept, its current theoretical framework is still insufficient. Here, we applied MST principles and our previous findings to propose an iterative growth model for forest growth (IGMF). This model and its extension show that WPC growth, net primary productivity and other carbon budgets - such as total primary productivity, autotrophic respiration, organ turnover biomass and non-structural carbohydrates - can be expressed as functions of current biomass, maintenance respiration rate per unit biomass and stand age or Mmax. These functions are globally convergent, allowing us to estimate the current (2018-2020) global Mmax at 1451 \u00b1 26 Pg based on the current state of WPCs alone, with a growth potential of 518 Pg, 83% of which is attributable to shrublands. By the end of the century, climate change is projected to reduce the total Mmax by 266 Pg, mainly in species-rich evergreen broadleaf forests. Further analysis indicates that species richness increases the climate sensitivity of Mmax, while soil organic and moisture affects the direction of this response. Our findings reveal WPC growth kinetics and show a shift in the main contributor to terrestrial carbon sequestration from forests to shrublands.

The increase in frequency and severity of drought, driven by climate change, is expected to worsen in the future. These occurrences are likely to adversely affect maize production and productivity, threatening the economic and social stability of millions of smallholder farmers. Understanding the genetics of hybrid performance under drought stress is crucial for designing breeding strategies to develop high-yielding hybrids. This study aimed to (i) evaluate the performance of three-way cross hybrids developed from elite inbred lines, including several drought-tolerant lines, using a line-by-tester mating design, and (ii) estimate the general combining ability (GCA) and specific combining ability (SCA) effects of the tropical maize inbred lines under managed drought and optimum conditions. A total of 265 maize inbred lines from the CIMMYT global maize breeding program were used as parents and crossed to six single cross testers to generate 795 testcross hybrids. These hybrids, along with six commercial hybrids as a check, were evaluated under managed drought and optimum conditions. Significant (p < 0.001) variations were observed among genotypes and genotypes-by-environment interactions (GEIs) for grain yield and other traits. There was a preponderance of GCA variance (lines and tester) over SCA variance, indicating that additive effects were more important in determining grain yield and other key traits under both managed drought and optimum conditions. Ten inbred lines (S2_8, S10_1, S6_4, S10_14, S2_14, S10_15, S8_7, S2_3, S8_15, and S13_5) with desirable GCA effects for grain yield and other traits were identified. Fourteen testcross hybrids were identified with high grain yield and desirable agronomic traits under both drought and optimum conditions. The identified lines and hybrids are useful sources to be used in breeding and deploying as stress-tolerant hybrids. High correlations observed between observed and GCA-predicted hybrid performance suggest the possibility to evaluate more hybrids with fixed resources. The study demonstrates that it is feasible to obtain high-yielding and drought-tolerant lines and hybrids.

The quantification of this extinction crisis has traditionally relied on the use of IUCN Red List conservation categories assigned to each assessed species. This approach reveals that a quarter of the world's animal species are currently threatened with extinction, and ~1% have been declared extinct. However, extinctions are preceded by progressive population declines through time that leave demographic \u2018footprints\u2019 that can alert us about the trajectories of species towards extinction. Therefore, an exclusive focus on IUCN conservation categories, without consideration of dynamic population trends, may underestimate the true extent of the processes of ongoing extinctions across nature. In fact, emerging evidence (e.g. the Living Planet Report), reveals a widespread tendency for sustained demographic declines (an average 69% decline in population abundances) of species globally. Yet, animal species are not only declining. Many species worldwide exhibit stable populations, while others are even thriving. Here, using population trend data for >71,000 animal species spanning all five groups of vertebrates (mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fishes) and insects, we provide a comprehensive global\u2010scale assessment of the diversity of population trends across species undergoing not only declines, but also population stability and increases. We show a widespread global erosion of species, with 48% undergoing declines, while 49% and 3% of species currently remain stable or are increasing, respectively. Geographically, we reveal an intriguing pattern similar to that of threatened species, whereby declines tend to concentrate around tropical regions, whereas stability and increases show a tendency to expand towards temperate climates.

These synthetic products pose ill effects on humans and the environment. In recent times, the trend has shifted towards developing and utilizing bioproducts that are eco-friendly and sustainable to use in agriculture. They enhance productivity and restore equilibrium naturally in agroecological systems. In this regard, plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) facilitate crop production in multiple ways. This review deals with the limitations and challenges of conventional pesticides following the different microbes used as bioproducts along with how Bacillus is one of the promising PGPR used in sustainable agriculture. Bacillus spp. improves crop growth in both direct and indirect ways through nitrogen fixation, P and K solubilization, phytohormones production, quorum quenching, biofilm formation, and lytic enzymes production. Moreover, Bacillus spp. boost plant resistance towards the notorious phytopathogens. As Bacillus spp. is eco-friendly, promotes plant growth, confers resistance against diseases, improves soil fertility, non-toxic, naturally occurring microbe, and supports sustainable agriculture, there is a need to explore the potential of native Bacillus spp. and to use them in bioproduct development to support sustainable agriculture. Abstract Food security will be a substantial issue in the near future due to the expeditiously growing global population. The current trend in the agriculture industry entails the extravagant use of synthesized pesticides and fertilizers, making sustainability a difficult challenge. Land degradation, lower production, and vulnerability to both abiotic and biotic stresses are problems caused by the usage of these pesticides and fertilizers. The major goal of sustainable agriculture is to ameliorate productivity and reduce pests and disease prevalence to such a degree that prevents large-scale damage to crops. Agriculture is a composite interrelation among plants, microbes, and soil. Plant microbes play a major role in growth promotion and improve soil fertility as well. Bacillus spp. produces an extensive range of bio-chemicals that assist in plant disease control, promote plant development, and make them suitable for agricultural uses. Bacillus spp. support plant growth by N fixation, P and K solubilization, and phytohormone synthesis, in addition to being the most propitious biocontrol agent. Moreover, Bacilli excrete extracellular metabolites, including antibiotics, lytic enzymes, and siderophores, and demonstrate antagonistic activity against phytopathogens. Bacillus spp. boosts plant resistance toward pathogens by inducing systemic resistance (ISR). The most effective microbial insecticide against insects and pests in agriculture is Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). Additionally, the incorporation of toxin genes in genetically modified crops increases resistance to insects and pests. There is a constant increase in the identified Bacillus species as potential biocontrol agents. Moreover, they have been involved in the biosynthesis of metallic nanoparticles. The main objective of this review article is to display the uses and application of Bacillus specie as a promising biopesticide in sustainable agriculture.

In this study, two strains of Bacillus siamensis, BB605-1 and BB653, were screened and identified from endophytes in healthy tomato and mangrove plants, respectively.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBoth strains demonstrated antagonistic activities against all 16 RSSC strains, representing eight sequevars from various hosts. The growth of RSSC was suppressed by the crude antimicrobial extracts produced by two strains. The pot inoculation experiment revealed the control efficiencies of two strains against tomato bacterial wilt as 59.63% and 63.98%, respectively. After imparting rifampicin resistance to the strains and applying them to tomato plants, both strains successfully established stable colonization in the rhizosphere, roots, stems, and leaves of tomato plants. Additionally, our study demonstrated that both strains exhibited significant plant growth-promoting properties. Complete genome sequencing revealed genome size of 3.868\u2009M\u2009bp with 3594 protein-coding genes for BB605-1, and 3.857\u2009M\u2009bp with 3600 protein-coding genes for BB653. Genome analysis of both strains identified seven secondary metabolite clusters with known antimicrobial properties and predicted three unknown compounds with potentially novel properties. Genome mining revealed several key genes associated with plant growth regulation, colonization, and biofilm formation, and we also detected these corresponding substances.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese findings provide a compelling case for the application of B. siamensis in agricultural practices.

The advent of the circular economy (CE) in this post-pandemic era has brought unpredictable sustainable challenges for the manufacturing industries. This research paper aims to bring more clarity to the extant literature on the relationship between environmental innovation (EI) and CE.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nIn this study, a systematic literature review methodology was used to research the determinants of EI in the knowledge environment that drives the implementation of a CE.\n\n\nFindings\nThis paper proposes a framework that articulates organizational learning and orientation dynamics and offers a new set of internal knowledge resources for a corporate CE. It is found that change toward CE requires connection with EI. However, successful CE growth largely depends on leveraging knowledge resources and orientation dynamics (stakeholder orientation, sustainability orientation, organization learning orientation and entrepreneurial orientation). CE techniques are still in their early phases of adoption and their implementation is still in its development. Circular knowledge economy (CKE) has the potential to be a useful alternative to achieving thriving CE to achieve sustainability in local and global businesses operations.\n\n\nPractical implications\nThis study helps companies to understand the organizational learning and different orientation dynamics for achieving CE principles. The research findings imply that EI is critical in establishing a sustainable transition toward CE through organizational learning and orientation dynamics and has garnered significant attention from academics, public policymakers and practitioners. The proposed framework can guide managers to develop sustainable policies related to the CE. This research recognizes that firm-level CKE is important in shaping how knowledge resources relate to CE within transition management literature.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThis paper abridges the knowledge gap in identifying key drivers and presents the current eminence, challenges and prognostications of sustainable EI parameters in the changing climate of CE. This study builds a framework that combines insights from different viewpoints and disciplines and extends one\u2019s understanding of the relationship between EI and CE.

It builds a theoretical bridge between EI and CE to illustrate how firms transition toward CE following the recommendations. Thus, researchers should continue to support their research with appropriate theories that have the potential to explain EI and CE relationship phenomena, with a particular emphasis on some promising but underutilized theories such as organizational learning, dynamic capabilities and stakeholder theories.\n", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-02-14", "synthetic_support_claim": "Change toward a circular economy requires connection with environmental innovation for successful growth.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Circular economy practices guarantee immediate cost savings for all manufacturing industries."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "253fa6d85ca6ae6fefff3e0877b606a799968d9f", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/253fa6d85ca6ae6fefff3e0877b606a799968d9f", "title": "Knowledge-based dynamic capabilities for managing paradoxical tensions in circular business model innovation: an empirical exploration of an incumbent firm", "abstract": "Purpose\nThis paper aims to gain insights into the paradoxical tensions emerging from circular business model innovation (CBMI) and how to overcome them by developing a theoretical framework drawing on two theoretical streams: firstly, the paradox theory for shedding light on the often \u201cinvisible\u201d contradictions generated by the implementation of circular economy (CE) principles in business model transformation; and secondly, the dynamic capability theory that can contribute to the investigation of how to manage these contradictions.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThe study uses a longitudinal case study approach to gain an in-depth understanding of the transformation and challenges faced by an incumbent firm in adopting a circular business model. Qualitative research methods are used to explore the paradoxical tensions and dynamic capabilities involved in the process.\n\nFindings\nThe study finds that incumbent firms face numerous challenges and paradoxical tensions in the CBMI process. These tensions arise from difficulties in implementing organizational changes, balancing competing priorities and managing conflicting goals. Dynamic capabilities are crucial in managing these tensions and facilitating the transition to a circular business model.\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nThis paper contributes to the theoretical development of paradox theory by applying it to the new field of CBMI which is currently slightly investigated and responds to the call for studies looking at more fine-grained types of sustainable business models. The study adds to previous literature that how the firm handles paradoxes and tensions influences the pace and results of the process. If the firm becomes discouraged during the early stages of identifying new opportunities, the pace slows down, and the firm becomes hesitant to collaborate more with partners. Furthermore, the ability to capitalize on these opportunities is affected by these tensions and contradictions.\n\nOriginality/value\nThis paper contributes to the literature by empirically investigating the process of CBMI in incumbent firms. It fills the gap in existing research by examining the existence of paradoxical tensions in a real-life setting and exploring the role of dynamic capabilities in managing these tensions. The findings provide practical insights for firms seeking a transition towards a CE and highlight that the ability to sense the external context should be developed as the new business model entails a central role of external actors.\n", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-10-15", "synthetic_support_claim": "Dynamic capabilities are crucial in managing paradoxical tensions during the circular business model innovation process.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "All firms can seamlessly adopt circular business models without encountering significant paradoxical tensions or challenges."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "c8e4fe256773a55b00751ebd36ca3af2e6581d50", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c8e4fe256773a55b00751ebd36ca3af2e6581d50", "title": "Leveraging social media data in knowledge management to identify noncompliance: insights from the foodservice industry", "abstract": "\n\nSocial media data contains a wealth of content related to customers\u2019 reactions to, and comments on, firms\u2019 performance.

Industries such as mining, manufacturing, building, etc., rapidly produce a substantial amount of Cd, posing environmental risks. Cd toxicity in crop plants decreases nutrient and water uptake and translocation, increases oxidative damage, interferes with plant metabolism and inhibits plant morphology and physiology. However, various conventional physicochemical approaches are available to remove Cd from the soil, including chemical reduction, immobilization, stabilization and electro-remediation. Nevertheless, these processes are costly and unfriendly to the environment because they require much energy, skilled labor and hazardous chemicals. In contrasting, contaminated soils can be restored by using bioremediation techniques, which use plants alone and in association with different beneficial microbes as cutting-edge approaches. This review covers the bioremediation of soils contaminated with Cd in various new ways. The bioremediation capability of bacteria and fungi alone and in combination with plants are studied and analyzed. Microbes, including bacteria, fungi and algae, are reported to have a high tolerance for metals, having a 98% bioremediation capability.

Cd was a proven carcinogen, and exposure to this metal has been linked to various adverse health effects, which were first reported in the mid-19th century and thoroughly investigated by the 20th century. The toxicokinetics and dynamics of Cd reveal its propensity for long biological retention and predominant storage in soft tissues. Until the 1950s, Cd pollution was caused by industrial activities, whereas nowadays, the main source is phosphate fertilizers, which strongly contaminate soil and water and affect human health and ecosystems. Cd enters the human body mainly through ingestion and inhalation, with food and tobacco smoke being the primary sources. It accumulates in various organs, particularly the kidney and liver, and is known to cause severe health problems, including renal dysfunction, bone diseases, cardiovascular problems, and many others. On a cellular level, Cd disrupts numerous biological processes, inducing oxidative stress generation and DNA damage. This comprehensive review explores Cd pollution, accumulation, distribution, and biological impacts on bacteria, fungi, edible mushrooms, plants, animals, and humans on a molecular level.

Nonetheless, abiotic stressor influences such as toxic metals severely limit its production. Thiourea (TU) is a sulfur-rich organic molecule that reduces the negative effects of environmental stresses such as heavy metals, including lead (Pb). Thus, the ongoing experiment was designed to assess the impact of thiourea amendment through soil (0 and 100 mg/L) on wheat cultivars Akbar 19 (V1) and Ghazi 11 (V2) under lead stress (0 mM and 15 mM Pb). The morphological features of the two cultivars (V1 and V2), comprising the fresh weight of shoots (17 and 23%), fresh weight of roots (31 and 26%), leaf area (22 and 10.9%), and total chlorophyll content (16%), were all decreased due to the toxic effects of stress caused by heavy metals. However, treatment of thiourea through soil allowed counteracting the decrease in biomass caused by heavy metals. It improved the initial weight of the shoots upto (12.5 and 14.2%), roots by (37.5 and 24%), leaf surface area upto (17.6 and 7.9%), and total chlorophyll contents (18 and 9.9%) while decreasing the MDA levels by (16.9 and 22.3%) and the activities of H2O2 upto (16 and 11.5%), root Pb activity upto (8.9 and 35%) and shoot Pb activity by (12.9 and 23.8%), grain concentration upto (25 and 7.56%), soil Pb content were reduced by(17 and 16%), in both varieties (V1 as well as V2).

Understanding the chemical compounds present in P. capitata can reveal potential medicinal properties. The present study examines the quantification of bioactive phytochemicals, antioxidant capacity and enzyme inhibitory evaluation of P. capitata extract against key enzymes involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy and glaucoma for the first time.

Through genome mining and combinatorial expression in tobacco, we identified 16 pathway enzymes that together enable the production of advanced QS pathway intermediates that represent a bridgehead for adjuvant bioengineering.

Description Adjuvants derived from the soapbark tree Saponins, a type of plant-derived glycoside, are useful in formulations including soaps, medicines, and root beer foam. Reed et al. studied how the Chilean soapbark tree (Quillaja saponaria) makes its saponins, which lend immunostimulatory activity to vaccines against shingles, malaria, and COVID-19 (see the Perspective by Chubatsu Nunes and Dang). The saponins are currently extracted from the tree\u2019s bark. The identification of enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway opens doors to the more sustainable production of these useful adjuvants and opportunities to engineer new adjuvants. \u2014PJH Genome-based pathway discovery reveals the biosynthetic route to vaccine adjuvants produced by the soapbark tree. INTRODUCTION Adjuvants are immunostimulatory substances that are added to vaccines to boost the immune response. Until recently, the only adjuvants available for clinical use were aluminum salts, either alone (alum) or in proprietary mixtures, and oil-in-water emulsions containing squalene, which have relatively low potency and substantial side effects, respectively. Natural surfactants (saponins) have been used as adjuvants in veterinary medicine for almost a century. The first saponin adjuvant, AS01, has recently been approved for use in the human shingles vaccine Shingrix and the malaria vaccine Mosquirix. It is also a promising adjuvant candidate for a tuberculosis vaccine. AS01 is a liposome-based formula that contains monophosphoryl lipid A and a saponin known as QS-21, which act synergistically to induce strong antibody and helper T cell responses. QS-21 is one of >100 structurally related QS saponins produced by the Chilean soapbark tree (Quillaja saponaria). These include QS-7 and QS-17, which, together with QS-21, are included in the Novovax NVX-CoV2373 COVID-19 vaccine. Because of their chemical complexity, the only current commercial source of QS saponins is the bark of the soapbark tree. The increasing demand for these highly valuable molecules has led to growing interest in the possibility of developing environmentally sustainable, \u201cfree-from-tree\u201d strategies to access these compounds in other ways. RATIONALE The biosynthetic pathway for QS saponins is not known. Elucidation of the genes and enzymes from the soapbark tree comprising the \u201cinstruction manual\u201d for making QS saponins would provide insights into how these molecules are biosynthesized and diversified. It would also pave the way for new routes to access and engineer natural and new-to-nature immunostimulants. RESULTS We first sequenced the genome of the soapbark tree. Then, using genome mining and combinatorial transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana, a wild relative of tobacco, we identified a total of 16 enzymes that together enable the production of advanced QS pathway intermediates that represent a bridgehead for adjuvant bioengineering. We also discovered a further three enzymes needed to make QS-7, a saponin with comparable adjuvant properties to QS-21 and low toxicity that is present in low abundance in Q. saponaria bark extract. Our work opens up the possibility of producing QS-7 and other related QS molecules in a heterologous expression system. CONCLUSION We have elucidated the pathway for the biosynthesis of advanced QS intermediates. Using our transient plant expression system, we were able to purify all of the intermediates at preparative scale, showing the power of this platform for rapid access to these molecules. We further demonstrate the production of the vaccine adjuvant QS-7. A number of plant natural products, including QS saponins and foxglove cardiac glycosides, have a d-fucose moiety, but the biosynthetic pathway to this sugar in plants was not previously known. In the present work, a route to d-fucosylation was discovered in which d-fucose is formed in situ from a 4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose attached to the saponin scaffold rather than being synthesized before transfer. Although the levels of QS-7 produced in N. benthamiana were low, they were comparable to those found in many tissues of Q. saponaria, with the exception of bark, which is about threefold higher. The availability of the complete gene sets for the biosynthesis of the heptasaccharide triterpene glycoside bridgehead QS saponins and QS-7 now present an opportunity for future endeavors to optimize production in heterologous expression systems with the ultimate aim of attaining commercial-scale yields. The availability of the complete genome sequence of Q. saponaria, coupled with our powerful and rapid transient expression platform, open up opportunities to access QS-21 and a diverse array of other saponins. This provides the potential to ultimately generate designer saponins with optimal immunostimulatory activity and low toxicity using metabolic engineering approaches.

However, optimizing the interfacial hydrogen bonding to enhance both catalytic activity and stability remains a significant challenge. Here, a novel catalyst design strategy is proposed based on the hard-soft acid-base principle, employing hard Lewis acids (LAs = ZrO2, TiO2, HfO2) to mediate the reconfiguration of interfacial hydrogen bonding, thereby enhancing the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of RuO2. Mechanistic analysis indicates that LAs prompt a directional evolution from a rigid hydrogen bonding network to free water, enhancing the trapping of interfacial water on the RuO2 surface, which continuously supplies reactants to the catalytic sites. Moreover, the interconnected hydrogen bonding network facilitates rapid proton transfer, reducing local acidity on the catalyst surface and preventing structural corrosion, thus significantly improving long-term stability. The tandem pathway of water supply and deprotonation transforms the dissolution mechanism of traditional Ru-based catalysts, emphasizing the widespread applicability. Consequently, ZrO2-RuO2 displays a significantly reduced overpotential of 170 mV and exhibits high durability, sustaining 1800 h at 10 mA cm-2 under acidic OER, and maintains robust activity for 100 h at 2 A cm-2 in PEMWE, outperforming most Ru/Ir-based catalysts.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-12-11", "synthetic_support_claim": "A ZrO2-RuO2 catalyst exhibits reduced overpotential and sustained durability outperforming most Ru/Ir-based catalysts.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "\"Alternative soft Lewis acids improve catalytic performance in acidic oxygen evolution reaction for proton exchange membrane water electrolysis.\""}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "d355b0caa73304440285ebdfdbb549acbcf245c0", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d355b0caa73304440285ebdfdbb549acbcf245c0", "title": "The Impact of Economic Corridor and Tourism on Local Community's Quality of Life under One Belt One Road Context", "abstract": "Economic corridors unlock new economic opportunities and tourism development in the region to achieve sustainable development goals.

This study\u2019s objectives emphasize exploring tourism and sustainable development pursuits under OBOR economic projects that open doors to improving residents' quality of life. The growing world is an eyewitness to a continuous rise in emissions and its severe consequences for humankind. It is necessary to show off the leading factors that result in tourism and economic activities causing environmental pollution rather than blame policymakers. Undoubtedly, many studies previously focused on demonstrating the influence of socio-economic factors that lead to better environmental quality. However, the empirical literature on tourism, social well-being, foreign direct investment, and the Environment in Belt and Road developed economies needed improvement. This research applied a series of advanced estimators that help demonstrate the study\u2019s probable results. This study explores the role of Social well-being (HDI), tourism development, FDI, renewable energy, information & communication technology (ICT), and urbanization on CO2 emissions in Belt and Road (BRI) developed economies.Estimated results exhibited the significant contribution of ICT and renewable energy to sustainability.

Thus, Lei-bamboo fields of different mulching and recovery ages were selected to investigate the dynamics of calcium and magnesium in both soil and bamboo tissue, and to explore their relationship to RMC composition and network patterns. The results showed that mulching increased the content of soil acidification, total organic carbon, alkali-hydrolysable nitrogen, available phosphorus, and available potassium but reduced soil exchangeable magnesium and calcium in soil as well as the magnesium and calcium content in rhizome, stem, and leaf of Lei-bamboo, which indicated an increased relative limitation on magnesium and calcium. Mulching also enhanced the \u03b1-diversity and reshaped the composition of RMC, which had a close link to Mg rather than nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. As the mulching years increased, the RMC network became bigger and more complex, and the magnesium and calcium gradually appeared in the network center, which further support the magnesium and calcium deficiency to RMC. Nearly all the variation mentioned above could be revered after the removing of mulching.

Ecological stress was modeled via a generalized additive model (GAM) with key predictors, including trends in the NDVI, NDWIveg (vegetation water content), NDWIow (open water), and LST from 1991 to 2023, which were derived using surface reflectance (SR) products from Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM+, and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS sensors. The model exhibited strong performance, with an R2 of 0.89. Model diagnostics using linear regression (R2 = 0.86), a high F-statistic, minimal intercept, and 10-fold cross-validation confirmed the model\u2019s robustness, with a consistent MSE (0.12) and cross-validated R2 of 0.86. Moran\u2019s I analysis also indicated significant spatial clustering. Findings indicate that mangroves in non-ravine, mainland coastal areas experience more ecological stress from disruptions in freshwater and sediment supply due to recent developments. In contrast, island coastal areas exhibit low stress levels due to minimal human activity, except in dense canopy regions where significant stress, likely linked to climate change, was observed. These results underscore the need for further investigation into the drivers of this ecological pressure.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-01-02", "synthetic_support_claim": "Mangrove ecosystems in mainland coastal areas experience more stress from freshwater and sediment supply disruptions.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "AI-based techniques can completely prevent mangrove degradation caused by coastal development and climate change."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "4814d09254dc17cb66a8e9449ce43d4fa4b752c2", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4814d09254dc17cb66a8e9449ce43d4fa4b752c2", "title": "A Molecularly Engineered Zwitterionic Hydrogel with Strengthened Anti\u2010Polyelectrolyte Effect: from High\u2010Rate Solar Desalination to Efficient Electricity Generation", "abstract": "Polyzwitterionic hydrogel is an emerging material for solar\u2010driven water evaporation in saline environment due to its special anti\u2010polyelectrolyte effect, which is a promising approach to co\u2010generation of freshwater and electricity.

Therefore, without rigorously showing that it can outperform traditional species-focused alternatives, its broad-scale adoption in conservation is unlikely. We present a large-scale replicated and controlled set of whole-lake experiments in fish conservation (20 lakes monitored over 6 years with more than 150,000 fish sampled) to examine the outcomes of ecosystem-based habitat enhancement (coarse woody habitat addition and shallow littoral zone creation) versus a widespread, species-focused alternative that has long dominated fisheries management practice (i.e., fish stocking). Adding coarse woody habitats alone did not, on average, enhance fish abundance, but creating shallow water habitat consistently did, especially for juvenile fish. Species-focused fish stocking completely failed. We provide strong evidence questioning the performance of species-focused conservation actions in aquatic ecosystems and instead recommend ecosystem-based management of key habitats. Description Adding habitat beats adding fish Conservation and management efforts are often focused on protecting individual species. Alternatively, management can target restoring ecosystem processes or broader habitats. Such ecosystem-based management practices have limited support because of their high cost and unknown efficacy compared with species-focused approaches. Radinger et al. tested the effects of two habitat-based interventions, creating shallow zones and adding dead wood, to the more common approach of stocking fish species. Across their 20 experimental lakes, the authors found that fish stocking was ineffectual, whereas shallow zone creation increased target fish abundance, especially that of juvenile fish.

The objectives of this study were to (1) determine daily movement across river basins and identify areas where Striped Bass congregate during their first year to infer potential nursery habitat; and (2) estimate first\u2010year survival poststocking.Hydroacoustic transmitters were surgically implanted into 28 phase II Striped Bass prior to stocking on December 1, 2020.

We evaluated multiple models to describe survival (e.g., constant, daily random effect model, and varying by season) and capture probability (e.g., constant and varying by zone).Daily persistence probability was high for all zones, and most fish spent most of their time in the delta region at the confluence of the Great Pee Dee and Waccamaw rivers.

We also discuss how habitat creates physical resistance and sets the cost of predation for predators and how habitat facilitates apparent competition within a community context. These roles of habitat are well established in ecology, but we believe they are underdeveloped from an applied perspective.

The thresholds identified represent critical inflection points for changing vegetation responses from highly resistant to highly vulnerable in response to drought stress, and as a warning signal for substantial vegetation impacts. Drought thresholds varied geographically, with much lower percentiles of soil-moisture anomalies in vegetated areas covered by more forests, corresponding to a comparably stronger capacity to mitigate soil water deficit stress in forested ecosystems. Generally, those lower thresholds are detected in more humid climates. State-of-the-art land models, however, overestimated thresholds of soil moisture (i.e. overestimating drought impacts), especially in more humid areas with higher forest covers and arid areas with few forest covers.

Heatwave events demonstrate a detrimental impact on VPu and VTu, resulting in an average decrease of 28% and 26%, respectively, during heatwave occurrences. The attribution analysis reveals divergent driving factors for the decline in VPu and VTu during heatwaves. The decrease in VPu is primarily influenced by SM, contributing 60% to the downward trend of VPu during heatwaves. Notably, VPu displays a sharp downward trend when SM falls below 0.38\u00a0m3/m3.

However, there is considerable debate associated with the methodological, ecological and physiological definitions of CTmax. The recent (re)introduction of the thermal death time (TDT) model has reconciled some of these issues and now offers a solid mathematical foundation to model CTmax by considering both intensity and duration of thermal stress. Nevertheless, the physiological origin and boundaries of this temperature-duration model remain unexplored. Supported by empirical data, we here outline a reconciling framework that integrates the TDT model, which operates at stressful temperatures, with the classic thermal performance curve (TPC) that typically describes biological functions at permissive temperatures. Further, we discuss how the TDT model is founded on a balance between disruptive and regenerative biological processes that ultimately defines a critical boundary temperature (Tc) separating the TDT and TPC models. Collectively, this framework allows inclusion of both repair and accumulation of heat stress, and therefore also offers a consistent conceptual approach to understand the impact of high temperature under fluctuating thermal conditions.

In this respect, the emerging production of black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) represents a promising system to upscale low-quality resources to higher-quality resources usable as feed or biodiesel. To optimize BSFL production it is critical to establish methods that are relevant to examine how rearing conditions, including temperature, affect growth, metabolism, and body composition at large scale. In a first set of experiments, we therefore compared how small-scale laboratory respirometry chambers (600 larvae) support gas exchange, growth, and metabolism in BSFL with similar measurements obtained from large-scale commercial conditions (>12 million larvae) at \u223c34-35\u00a0\u00b0C. Having observed that small- and large-scale systems generated comparable measurements of growth and metabolism, we used our small-scale respirometry system to examine in detail how substrate rearing temperature ranging from 27.0 to 41.9\u00a0\u00b0C influenced growth, metabolism, and body composition in BSFL. Here we found that 7-day growth of BSFL was stable and high at 27, 35, and 39\u00a0\u00b0C, while a rearing temperature of \u223c42\u00a0\u00b0C caused a severe, but sublethal, depression of growth and metabolism. Despite the general similarities in total growth at 27, 35, and 39\u00a0\u00b0C, we found considerable acceleration of metabolism and development at the two higher rearing temperatures (35 and 39\u00a0\u00b0C). In contrast, the lower rearing temperature (27\u00a0\u00b0C) resulted in reduced CO2 production per kg larvae produced and the was associated with a higher crude protein to crude lipid ratio in larvae after the 7-day growth period.

Global trends at the interspecific scale suggest independence between leaf and root traits described by three functional dimensions: resource acquisition above\u2010 and belowground and degree of mycorrhizal collaboration belowground. However, there are ecological and evolutionary reasons to expect different patterns of variation within species, especially within seedlings\u2014the stage at which most tree mortality occurs. Describing the intraspecific patterns of trait variation in seedlings will improve the understanding of tree populations' ability to cope with environmental change. We ask the following questions: (1) How do traits above\u2010 and belowground co\u2010vary within species? (2) How do traits relate to soil nutrients and light conditions? We collected root and leaf traits on 131 seedlings from four naturally occurring woody species across eight sites in a temperate, deciduous broadleaf forest in the USA. We measured traits reflecting resource use strategies\u2014specific leaf area, leaf nitrogen, root nitrogen, and root tissue density\u2014and those defining the collaboration axis\u2014specific root length and root diameter. We measured light conditions for each seedling and soil nitrogen and phosphorus to examine the relationship between traits and abiotic conditions using a novel multivariate regression analysis approach. We found that above\u2010 and belowground traits segregated into independent functional axes and that the collaboration axis merged with the belowground resource\u2010acquisition axis.

To investigate this, we established a common\u2010garden field experiment including temperate grassland species with SLAs of 17.9\u201339.3\u2009mm2\u2009g\u22121 and maximal rooting depths of 16\u2013252\u2009cm.

The data presented here showcase Madagascar as a unique \u201cliving laboratory\u201d for our understanding of evolution and the complex interactions between people and nature. The gathering and analysis of biodiversity data must continue and accelerate if we are to fully understand and safeguard this unique subset of Earth\u2019s biodiversity. Description Protecting Madagascar Madagascar has been isolated from mainland Africa and Asia for more than 80 million years and has developed a distinctive flora and fauna, with more than 90% of its species endemic to the island nation. It is also home to the Malagasy people, with a population of about 30 million, and was first colonized by humans around the first century BCE. The island\u2019s biodiverse wildlife is highly threatened, and much of its human population lives below the poverty line. In Reviews, Antonelli et al. and Ralimanana et al. characterize the biological history and diversity of the island and examine conservation status and actions required to protect biodiversity and improve living standards and well-being for the Malagasy people. \u2014SNV A review explains that Madagascar\u2019s biodiversity is the product of complex processes that produced remarkable life-forms, many remaining undocumented. BACKGROUND The Republic of Madagascar is home to a unique assemblage of taxa and a diverse set of ecosystems. These high levels of diversity have arisen over millions of years through complex processes of speciation and extinction. Understanding this extraordinary diversity is crucial for highlighting its global importance and guiding urgent conservation efforts. However, despite the detailed knowledge that exists on some taxonomic groups, there are large knowledge gaps that remain to be filled. ADVANCES Our comprehensive analysis of major taxonomic groups in Madagascar summarizes information on the origin and evolution of terrestrial and freshwater biota, current species richness and endemism, and the utilization of this biodiversity by humans. The depth and breadth of Madagascar\u2019s biodiversity\u2014the product of millions of years of evolution in relative isolation \u2014is still being uncovered. We report a recent acceleration in the scientific description of species but many remain relatively unknown, particularly fungi and most invertebrates. DIGITIZATION Digitization efforts are already increasing the resolution of species richness patterns and we highlight the crucial role of field- and collections-based research for advancing biodiversity knowledge in Madagascar. Phylogenetic diversity patterns mirror that of species richness and endemism in most of the analyzed groups. Among the new data presented, our update on plant numbers estimates 11,516 described vascular plant species native to Madagascar, of which 82% are endemic, in addition to 1215 bryophyte species, of which 28% are endemic. Humid forests are highlighted as centers of diversity because of their role as refugia and centers of recent and rapid radiations, but the distinct endemism of other areas such as the grassland-woodland mosaic of the Central Highlands and the spiny forest of the southwest is also important despite lower species richness. Endemism in Malagasy fungi remains poorly known given the lack of data on the total diversity and global distribution of species. However, our analysis has shown that ~75% of the fungal species detected by environmental sequencing have not been reported as occurring outside of Madagascar. Among the 1314 species of native terrestrial and freshwater vertebrates, levels of endemism are extremely high (90% overall)\u2014all native nonflying terrestrial mammals and native amphibians are found nowhere else on Earth; further, 56% of the island\u2019s birds, 81% of freshwater fishes, 95% of mammals, and 98% of reptile species are endemic. Little is known about endemism in insects, but data from the few well-studied groups on the island suggest that it is similarly high. The uses of Malagasy species are many, with much potential for the uncovering of useful traits for food, medicine, and climate mitigation. OUTLOOK Considerable work remains to be done to fully characterize Madagascar\u2019s biodiversity and evolutionary history. The multitudes of known and potential uses of Malagasy species reported here, in conjunction with the inherent value of this unique and biodiverse region, reinforce the importance of conserving this unique biota in the face of major threats such as habitat loss and overexploitation. The gathering and analysis of data on Madagascar\u2019s remarkable biota must continue and accelerate if we are to safeguard this unique and highly threatened subset of Earth\u2019s biodiversity. Emergence and composition of Madagascar\u2019s extraordinary biodiversity. Madagascar\u2019s biota is the result of over 160 million years of evolution, mostly in geographic isolation, combined with sporadic long distance immigration events and local extinctions. (Left) We show the age of the oldest endemic Malagasy clade for major groups (from bottom to top): arthropods, bony fishes, reptiles, flatworms, birds, amphibians, flowering plants, mammals, non-flowering vascular plants, and mollusks). Humans arrived recently, some 10,000 to 2000 years (top right) and have directly or indirectly caused multiple extinctions (including hippopotamus, elephant birds, giant tortoises, and giant lemurs) and introduced many new species (such as dogs, zebu, rats, African bushpigs, goats, sheep, rice). Endemism is extremely high and unevenly distributed across the island (the heat map depicts Malagasy palm diversity, a group characteristic of the diverse humid forest). Human use of biodiversity is widespread, including 1916 plant species with reported uses. The scientific description of Malagasy biodiversity has accelerated greatly in recent years (bottom right), yet the diversity and evolution of many groups remain practically unknown, and many discoveries await.", "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-12-02", "synthetic_support_claim": "Humid forests in Madagascar are centers of diversity and endemism due to recent rapid radiations.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "\"Madagascar\u2019s biodiversity is primarily threatened by climate change rather than habitat loss or exploitation.\""}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "c6bb14f652b15124242a0b1d4c60dd3bf566d001", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c6bb14f652b15124242a0b1d4c60dd3bf566d001", "title": "Estimation of Divergence Times and Reconstruction of Ancestral Morphological Characters of the Genus Mimosa (Leguminosae, Caesalpinioideae)", "abstract": "Abstract\u2014 The subfamily Caesalpiniodeae has been the subject of several recent taxonomic delimitations, placing Mimosa in what is recognized as the \u201cMimosa clade.\u201d Specifically, in recent decades several phylogenetic studies have been conducted with\n regard to the genus, but the estimation of the divergence times of some previously unanalyzed species was unknown and the reconstruction of ancestral morphological states to date has been limited to the mapping of characters on a phylogenetic tree.

This study estimated MFRs accumulation over the next 50 years under varying PE and polybutylene adipate terephthalate (PBAT) film recovery scenarios: no recovery, and recovery rates increased to 80%, 85%, 90%, and 95%. Additionally, cumulative ecological effects (CEEs) of MFR pollution were assessed based on historical MFRs accumulations of 75 kg hm\u22122, 160 kg hm\u22122, 220 kg hm\u22122, 300 kg hm\u22122, and 400 kg hm\u22122, by evaluating direct and indirect ecological effects. The findings revealed that (1) with no recovery, PE film residues could increase by 480 kg hm\u22122, whereas achieving a 95% recovery rate could limit residues increasing to below the national threshold of 75 kg hm\u22122, outperforming the 80%, 85%, and 90% recovery rates. On the other hand, using PBAT film would maintain the increasing MFRs below 75 kg hm\u22122 regardless of recovery rate. (2) Without PE film recovery, CEEs would intensify significantly, as both the direct and indirect effects increase notably, while the CEEs of MFRs could maintain the current status or decrease under the strategy of 95% recovery rate of PE film and using PBAT film, similar to the variation of direct effects. However, indirect effects would persist due to ongoing microplastics (MPs) and phthalate esters (PAEs) released from residual films. Overall, a 95% PE film recycling rate and PBAT film usage emerged as particularly effective strategies for minimizing MFRs accumulation and mitigating ecological impacts over the next 50 years. Further research should prioritize the indirect ecological effects of MFRs, given their persistence despite reduction efforts. The results could provide a theoretical support for agricultural sustainable development in arid regions.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-11-19", "synthetic_support_claim": "A 95% PE film recycling rate and PBAT film usage are highly effective in minimizing MFRs.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Biodegradable films completely eliminate the ecological impacts of plastic pollution in agricultural lands."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "514f5060dd014f719b5471dae4eb7530a7e71d04", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/514f5060dd014f719b5471dae4eb7530a7e71d04", "title": "Effect of Biodegradable Mulch and Different Synthetic Mulches on Growth and Yield of Field-Grown Small-Fruited Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.)", "abstract": "Mulching is a widely adopted practice in vegetable cultivation globally.

Currently, no biomaterials have been reported to simultaneously up-regulate and down-regulate ROS to achieve broad-spectrum antibacterial and antioxidant properties. Inspired by the site-dependent effect of nanomaterials, a micron-sized ferroferric oxide (Fe3O4)/MXene (FM) heterojunction is synthesized using a hydrothermal method. The FM heterojunction could scavenge extracellular ROS by activating catalase (CAT)-like and superoxide dismutase (SOD)-like nanozyme activities. Meanwhile, FM heterojunction could release ferric ions and ferrous ions by defect engineering to induce bacterial ferroptosis, up-regulating intercellular ROS, and lipid peroxidation. For applications in vivo, FM heterojunction is incorporated into the tips of gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA)-based microneedle (termed as GFM microneedle) using a two-step casting technique. The results showed that GFM microneedle combined with photothermal therapy could improve S. aureus-infected skin regeneration in diabetic rats.

A simple upscaling to the global system indicates that the temperature dependence decreases to ~22 kilojoules per mole because (i) the lack of runoff limits weathering and retains base metal cations on half the land surface and (ii) other landscapes are regolith-shielded and show little weathering response to temperature.

Collecting water from the fog seems to be an effective method to defuse this crisis. Nonetheless, the existing fog collection methods have the limitations of the low fog collection rate and efficiency because of their gravity-based droplet shedding. Here, the aforementioned limitations are resolved by proposing a new fog collection method based on the self-driven jet phenomenon of the mini fog droplets. A prototype fog collector (PFC) composed of a square container that is filled with water is first designed. Both sides of the PFC are superhydrophobic but covered with superhydrophilic pore array. The mini fog droplets touching the side wall are easily captured and spontaneously and rapidly penetrate into the pores to form jellyfish-like jets, which greatly increases the droplet shedding frequency, guaranteeing a higher fog collection rate and efficiency compared with the existing fog collection methods.

Although significant progress, such as serial wedge-shaped tracks with curved edges, has evolved to advance the liquid transport, the ultrafast and long-distance transporting of drop-shaped liquid remains challenging. Here, inspired by the cactus spine that enables fast droplet transport and the serial spindle knot of spider silk, which is capable of collecting condensate from a wide range of distances, we created serial wedge-shaped superhydrophilic patterns and optimized their side edges with a convex brachistochrone curve to boost the acceleration. The junctions of the serial patterns were meanwhile reformed into concave brachistochrone curves to lower the energy barrier for sustained transport. For transporting the liquid in drop shapes to the long distance at high velocity, the wedge-shaped tracks were slenderized to the greatest extent to suppress the liquid spreading and thus prevent the degradation of the Laplace driving force. Moreover, the junction that determines the energy barrier of droplet striding was carefully designed based on the principle of minimizing momentum loss. The exquisite architecture design pushed the droplet transport to a maximum instantaneous velocity of 207.7 mm\u00b7s-1 and an outermost transport distance of 120.5 mm, exceeding most wettability or geometric gradient based reports. The transported volume of the droplets can be readily regulated by simply scaling the created architectures.

Herein, a novel approach is reported by constructing liquid-like surfaces with double anti-fouling structure, incorporating soft nanomicelles within a rigid, chemically cross-linked network for both anti-membrane-fouling and effective viscous water-in-oil emulsion separation. The coating significantly outperforms perfluorinated and commercial polytetrafluoroethylene (PVDF) membranes, effectively preventing the adhesion of viscous oils like crude oil and pump oil, and alleviating severe membrane fouling.

Even after 15\u00a0h immersion in strong acids, alkalis, salts, or organic solvents, its separation efficiency remains above 95%.

The objectives of this study were to explain the variability in the mitigating effect of 3-NOP and to investigate the interaction between diet composition and 3-NOP dose, using meta-analytical approaches. Data from 13 articles (14 experiments) met the selection criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis, and 48 treatment means were used for the analysis. Mean differences were calculated as 3-NOP treatment mean minus control treatment mean and then expressed as a percentage of the control mean. Three types of models were developed: (1) one including 3-NOP dose, overall mean, and individual covariate; (2) a combination of neutral detergent fiber (NDF), 3-NOP dose, and overall mean; and (3) one selected model from all combinations of up to 5 covariates, which were compared using a leave-one-out cross validation method. Models including only 3-NOP dose resulted in a significant reduction of 32.7%, 30.9%, and 32.6% for CH4 production (g/d), yield (g/kg dry matter intake), and intensity (g/kg energy-corrected milk), respectively, at an average 3-NOP dose of 70.5 mg/kg dry matter (DM). The greater the NDF content in the diet, the lower the reduction efficiency for a given 3-NOP dose. For 10 g/kg DM increase in NDF content from its mean (329 g of NDF/kg of DM) the 3-NOP effect on CH4 production was impaired by 0.633%, the 3-NOP effect on CH4 yield by 0.647%, and the 3-NOP effect on CH4 intensity by 0.723%. The analysis based on leave-one-out cross validation showed an increase in NDF and crude fat content reduces efficacy of 3-NOP and an increase in 3-NOP dose increases efficacy. A 1% (10 g/kg) DM decrease in dietary NDF content from its mean may increase the efficacy of 3-NOP in reducing CH4 production by 0.915%. A 1% (10 g/kg DM) decrease in dietary crude fat content from its mean enhances the efficacy of 3-NOP on CH4 production by 3.080% at a given dose and NDF level. For CH4 yield, next to 3-NOP dose, dietary NDF content and dietary crude fat content were included in the selected model, but also dietary starch content with an opposite direction to NDF and crude fat. The effect of 3-NOP dose on CH4 intensity was similar to its effect on CH4 production, whereas the effect of dietary NDF content was slightly lower.

Response variables were DMI, milk yield (MY), ECM yield, ECM feed efficiency, BW, BW change, and concentrations of milk fat, true protein, lactose, and MUN. Treatment and control mean differences (MD) as well as standardized MD were calculated and used for data presentation and statistical analysis, respectively. Dose (\u00b1 SD; 77.0 \u00b1 33.17 mg 3-NOP/kg DMI), forage-to-concentrate ratio (FC; 58.9 \u00b1 8.83%, expressed as average \u00b1 SD% of forage in the diet), dietary concentrations of CP, ether extract, NDF, and starch (16.3 \u00b1 1.84%, 4.3 \u00b1 1.03%, 33.7 \u00b1 4.40%, and 20.9 \u00b1 3.97%, as average \u00b1 SD% of DM, respectively), supplementation length (days), and DIM and BW of the cows at the beginning of the study were used as continuous explanatory variables. Mixed-effects models were fitted using the robust variance estimation method. Full models containing uncorrelated explanatory variables (Pearson correlation <0.50) were fitted, and variables were removed from the final model if nonsignificant using the stepwise selection approach. Compared with control, supplementation of 3-NOP decreased DMI and MY by 0.80 \u00b1 0.149 and 0.98 \u00b1 0.250 kg/d, respectively, but only numerically decreased ECM by 0.50 \u00b1 0.298 kg/d. Consequently, feed efficiency was increased by 0.05 \u00b1 0.012 kg ECM/kg DMI with 3-NOP supplementation. Body weight and BW change were not affected by 3-NOP supplementation. Milk fat, true protein, and MUN concentrations were increased by 0.09 \u00b1 0.028%, 0.02 \u00b1 0.006%, and 0.59 \u00b1 0.106 mg/dL, respectively. Increasing 3-NOP dose further decreased DMI and increased milk fat and MUN concentrations. Increasing dietary NDF and FC lessened the negative effect of 3-NOP on DMI and MY, respectively, and decreased its effect on milk fat and MUN (dietary NDF concentration effect only). Similarly, increasing dietary CP lessened the negative effect of 3-NOP on DMI and decreased its effect on MUN. To explain some of the production effects herein observed, ruminal fermentation data from 6 published studies were included in the meta-regression. Supplementation of 3-NOP tended to increase rumen pH and decreased NH3 concentration. Concentrations of total VFA, acetate, and the acetate-to-propionate ratio were decreased, whereas the concentration of propionate was increased, and that of butyrate was numerically increased by 3-NOP supplementation. Overall, 3-NOP supplementation of dairy cow diets decreased DMI and MY but did not affect ECM because of increased milk fat and true protein contents. Increased milk fat and MUN responses can be explained by shifted ruminal fermentation, and the increased milk true protein response may be explained by increased rumen propionate molar proportion by 3-NOP supplementation.", "publicationTypes": ["MetaAnalysis", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-01", "synthetic_support_claim": "Supplementation of 3-NOP in dairy cow diets decreases dry matter intake and milk yield while increasing feed efficiency.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "3-NOP supplementation significantly improves overall milk quality and productivity in dairy cows."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "c99e3873f674ef13b66515b5f687dfbe847bf9a3", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c99e3873f674ef13b66515b5f687dfbe847bf9a3", "title": "Scalable Production of Biodegradable, Recyclable, Sustainable Cellulose-Mineral Foams via Coordination Interaction Assisted Ambient Drying.", "abstract": "Heavy reliance on petrochemical-based plastic foams in both industry and society has led to severe plastic pollution (the so-called \"white pollution\").

Superhydrophobic surfaces (SHSs) have attracted increasing attention due to their potential advantages of keeping the airframe dry without causing additional aerodynamic losses. However, the passive anti-icing performances of SHSs reported to date varied a lot under different icing test conditions. Therefore, a systematic investigation is necessary to elucidate the icing conditions where SHSs can remain effective and pave the way for SHSs toward practical anti-icing applications. Herein, we designed and fabricated a typical type of SHS featuring dual-scale hierarchical structures with arrayed micromountains (with both spacings and heights of tens of micrometers) covered by single-scale sandy-corrugation-like periodic structures (with both spacings and heights of only several micrometers) (termed SS1). Its anti-icing performances under three representative icing conditions, including static water freezing, dynamic supercooled-droplet impinging, and icing wind tunnel conditions, were comparatively investigated. The SS1 SHS maintained a lower static ice-adhesion strength (<60 kPa even after 50 deicing cycles at temperatures as low as -25 \u00b0C), which was attributed to a cumulative cracking effect facilitating the ice detachment. Within the laboratory dynamic icing tests, the SS1 SHSs with micromountain heights of 20-30 \u03bcm performed optimally in the antiadhesion of supercooled droplets (at an impinging velocity of 3.4 m/s and temperatures of -5 to -25 \u00b0C). In spite of the significant anti-icing performances of the SS1 SHSs in both static and dynamic laboratory tests, they could hardly sustain reliable passive anti-icing performances in harsher icing wind tunnel tests with supercooled droplets impinging their surfaces at velocities of up to 50 m/s at a temperature of -5 \u00b0C for 10 min.

Most people do this all around the world but throwing away food can actually harm the environment. One way to reduce this harm is by turning the food scraps into animal feed. This not only helps the environment but also makes livestock production cheaper. Different technologies have been developed to make a safe and healthy animal feed from food waste. This helps us to get rid of waste by giving animals a new source of protein and recycling the discarded food waste. This article talks about how to turn food waste into animal food and its advantages. However, it is important to make sure the feed is of high quality and safe for the animals. It is also important to do research and development to make even better food-waste-based animal feed by reducing production costs and waste disposal, thereby making things better for both the animals and the environment. Overall, using food waste as animal food is a good waste management idea that provides food security and preserves the environment. So, next time when you have some leftover food, remember that it could be turned into something useful instead of being thrown away. Abstract The growing population and healthy food demands have led to a rise in food waste generation, causing severe environmental and economic impacts. However, food waste (FW) can be converted into sustainable animal feed, reducing waste disposal and providing an alternative protein source for animals. The utilization of FW as animal feed presents a solution that not only tackles challenges pertaining to FW management and food security but also lessens the demand for the development of traditional feed, which is an endeavour that is both resource and environmentally intensive in nature. Moreover, this approach can also contribute to the circular economy by creating a closed-loop system that reduces the use of natural resources and minimizes environmental pollution. Therefore, this review discusses the characteristics and types of FW, as well as advanced treatment methods that can be used to recycle FW into high-quality animal feed and its limitations, as well as the benefits and drawbacks of using FW as animal feed. Finally, the review concludes that utilization of FW as animal feed can provide a sustainable solution for FW management, food security, preserving resources, reducing environmental impacts, and contributing to the circular bioeconomy.", "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-04-01", "synthetic_support_claim": "Utilization of food waste as animal feed provides a sustainable solution for food waste management.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Animal feed derived from food waste can completely replace traditional feed without any negative consequences."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "a76aae8e851d0b0570f839547e7106e5dfbae7b0", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a76aae8e851d0b0570f839547e7106e5dfbae7b0", "title": "Grape Pomace for Feed Enrichment to Improve the Quality of Animal-Based Foods", "abstract": "In this review, the potential role of grape pomace (GP) as a tool for improving feed has been critically summarized, considering the findings of the literature of the last five years (2020\u20132024).

We found that the AAHPs are essentially chemically inert to Fe3+ but highly reactive toward Fe2+.

However, climate change poses a significant threat to foundation species and the ecosystems they support. We review the impacts of climate change on common marine foundation species, including corals, kelps, corals, seagrasses, salt marsh plants, mangroves, and bivalves. It is evident that marine foundation species have already been severely impacted by several climate change drivers, often through interactive effects with other human stressors, such as pollution, overfishing, and coastal development. Despite considerable variation in geographical, environmental, and ecological contexts, direct and indirect effects of gradual warming and subsequent heatwaves have emerged as the most pervasive drivers of observed impact and potent threat across all marine foundation species, but effects from sea level rise, ocean acidification, and increased storminess are expected to increase. Documented impacts include changes in the genetic structures, physiology, abundance, and distribution of the foundation species themselves and changes to their interactions with other species, with flow-on effects to associated communities, biodiversity, and ecosystem functioning.

Recognizing fire classes is critical, since each kind demands a unique suppression approach. Proper fire classification helps to decrease the risk to both life and property. The fuel type is used to determine the fire class, so that the appropriate extinguishing agent can be selected. This study takes advantage of recent advances in deep learning, employing YOLOv11 variants (YOLO11n, YOLO11s, YOLO11m, YOLO11l, and YOLO11x) to classify fires according to their class, assisting in the selection of the correct fire extinguishers for effective fire control. Moreover, a hybrid model that combines YOLO11n and MobileNetV2 is developed for multi-class classification. The dataset used in this study is a combination of five existing public datasets with additional manually annotated images, to create a new dataset covering the five fire classes, which was then validated by a firefighting specialist. The hybrid model exhibits good performance across all classes, achieving particularly high precision, recall, and F1 scores. Its superior performance is especially reflected in the macro average, where it surpasses both YOLO11n and YOLO11m, making it an effective model for datasets with imbalanced classes, such as fire classes. The YOLO11 variants achieved high performance across all classes. YOLO11s exhibited high precision and recall for Class A and Class F, achieving an F1 score of 0.98 for Class A. YOLO11m also performed well, demonstrating strong results in Class A and No Fire with an F1 score of 0.98%.

Understanding the impact of area-based socioeconomic factors on survival outcomes may help to better understand these disparities. This research aims to understand how living in counties with lower educational attainment, higher poverty, higher unemployment, lower median household income, and population density in urban areas may impact survival rates of women diagnosed with uterine cancer across racial/ethnic groups. Our findings show that lower county-level socioeconomic characteristics are linked with worse survival rates, mainly impacting women diagnosed with aggressive histologic subtypes and underrepresented racial/ethnic groups.

Several creative approaches and solutions that enable such combinations of chemo- and biocatalysis in water to be realized and applied to synthetic problems are presented herein, reflecting the state-of-the-art in this blossoming field.

Several transport mechanisms and strategies used to interpret and improve the thermoelectric performance of SnSe have been important for understanding and developing other material systems with SnSe-like characteristics. Similar to other thermoelectrics, building commercially viable SnSe-based devices requires advances in device efficiency and service stability.

However, a decade ago, tin selenide was shown to have a high thermoelectric efficiency. That discovery and further refinement of this compound have been important for developing a new generation of thermoelectric materials and devices. \u2014Brent Grocholski BACKGROUND Electrical and thermal transport determines the basic physical properties of materials, and the combination of them offers various prospects for applications. Electrical transport is usually accompanied by heat transfer; however, thermally conducting and electrically insulating ceramics are crucial for modern electronics. Electrical conducting and thermal insulating materials, such as those attractive for thermoelectrics, achieve power generation and cooling through the Seebeck and Peltier effects. Although these materials may provide a green pathway for sustainable energy technologies, their widespread application is restricted by the relatively low efficiency. Achieving better energy conversion efficiency requires further decoupling of electrical and thermal transport behavior. ADVANCES Complex electronic structure tends to favor electrical transport, whereas large unit cell and complex lattice structure lead to low thermal conductivity. These trends have facilitated the discovery of various thermoelectrics. Among them, tin selenide (SnSe) has been one prominent material because it possesses crucial characteristics for thermoelectricity. After 10 years, SnSe-based materials have been developed with excellent performance for power generation and electronic cooling at the lab scale. These materials not only provide potentially cost-effective, environmentally friendly, earth-abundant, and highly-effective thermoelectric candidates, but the developmental arc of SnSe has motivated the discovery and improvement of other thermoelectrics with similar characteristics. High thermoelectric performance in SnSe crystals was discovered in 2014, owing to their intrinsic low thermal conductivity and high in-plane carrier mobility. This breakthrough triggered a large number of investigations to determine the origin of thermal transport in SnSe. Progress to deepen the understanding of this transport behavior has been made, including investigating multiple electronic bands and their synglisis, three-dimensional (3D) charge and 2D phonon transport, oxidation removal, and lattice plainification. These achievements deepen the physical understanding of SnSe and offer important guidance for other thermoelectric material systems. After obtaining promising material properties, device construction becomes a crucial task. SnSe-based research has been mostly focused on the materials, whereas the development of SnSe-based devices is at a nascent stage. Sufficient development is lacking on n-type SnSe to match its p-type counterpart, and appropriate interfacial engineering is required to ensure desirable device efficiency and service stability. SnSe has application potential across various fields, highlighting the importance of developing multifunctional materials with an interdisciplinary philosophy. OUTLOOK Current thermoelectric research covers machine learning and intelligent computing, high-throughput material design and synthesis, device design and assembly, and interdisciplinary outlooks. Progress on SnSe has stimulated research efforts to explore thermoelectrics with similar characteristics and has inspired investigations in other areas more broadly. Future development on SnSe and other similar thermoelectrics requires more attention to device design and application exploration while enhancing material performance and stability. Additionally, more application scenarios are expected to promote the thermoelectric industry, which might be realized by utilizing the emerging interdisciplinary. The combination of thermoelectricity with other technologies might provide transformative opportunities for materials science and renewable energy technologies in the future. Thermal and electrical transport determines fundamental physical properties. Materials can be divided into four quadrants, with some examples of common metals, ceramics, and organics. The most promising thermoelectrics are electrical conducting but thermal insulating, occupying the top left quadrant. Although the other three categories have some candidate materials, the development of \"optimal\" thermoelectrics remains challenging because of coupling between the different types of transport.

The present cohort study included all participants older than 50 years who were without dementia at baseline and had available exposure, outcome, and demographic data between 1998 and 2016 (N\u2009=\u200927\u202f857).

Here, we estimate the air quality-related human health damages of wild capture fisheries production in the United States via the emission and formation of particulate matter (PM2.5). We quantify annual deaths attributable to primary and secondary PM2.5 from commercial marine vessel emissions using county- and species-specific fishing activity and landings data.

The air quality-related health impacts of seafood vary widely by species and by fishing activity location. Notably, the highest impact seafood-based sources of protein production tend to be far less damaging than terrestrial animal-based sources of protein and are comparable to plant-based proteins, largely mirroring previously described broader trends for the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of these various protein sources.

Over the past two decades, vaccines have revolutionized the sector by addressing these issues while enhancing productivity and ecological balance. Advanced vaccine technologies, including DNA, recombinant, and inactivated vaccines, have demonstrated their potential to transform aquaculture and sea ranching. Innovations like the recombinant DNA vaccine for goldfish using the G protein expressed by baculovirus for spring viremia for carp and the ME-VAC Aqua Strept vaccine for tilapia highlight their ability to reduce antibiotic dependence and support greener practices. Multivalent vaccines in salmon farming further showcase their effectiveness in improving fish health and productivity. Emerging solutions such as plant-based and mucosal vaccines offer scalable, cost-effective options for immunizing large fish populations, reducing disease-related losses, and stabilizing seafood supply chains. Vaccines also improve the survival rates of hatchery-reared fish in natural habitats, supporting long-term sustainability.

In terrestrial ecosystems, plants are exposed to MP stress, thereby affecting overall plant growth and development. This review article has critically analyzed the effects of MP stress in plants. We found that MP stress-induced reduction in plant physical growth is accompanied by two complementary effects: (i) blockage of pores in seed coat or roots to alter water and nutrient uptake, and (ii) induction of drought due to increased soil cracking effects of MPs. Nonetheless, the reduction in physiological growth under MP stress is accompanied by four complementary effects: (i) excessive production of ROS, (ii) alteration in leaf and root ionome, (iii) impaired hormonal regulation, and (iv) decline in chlorophyll and photosynthesis. Considering that, we suggested that targeting the redox regulatory mechanisms could be beneficial in improving tolerance to MPs in plants; however, antioxidant activities are highly dependent on plant species, plant tissue, MP type, and MP dose. MP stress also indirectly reduces plant growth by altering soil productivity. However, MP-induced negative effects vary due to the presence of different surface functional groups and particle sizes. In the end, we suggested the utilization of agronomic approaches, including the application of growth regulators, biochar, and replacing plastic mulch with crop residues, crop diversification, and biological degradation, to ameliorate the effects of MP stress in plants.

Internationally, increasing recycling rate of polyethylene (PE) film and adopting biodegradable films are recommended strategies to mitigate plastic pollution in farmland, aiming to increase agricultural sustainability and food security. However, impacts of the future of these strategies remain underexplored. This study estimated MFRs accumulation over the next 50 years under varying PE and polybutylene adipate terephthalate (PBAT) film recovery scenarios: no recovery, and recovery rates increased to 80%, 85%, 90%, and 95%. Additionally, cumulative ecological effects (CEEs) of MFR pollution were assessed based on historical MFRs accumulations of 75 kg hm\u22122, 160 kg hm\u22122, 220 kg hm\u22122, 300 kg hm\u22122, and 400 kg hm\u22122, by evaluating direct and indirect ecological effects. The findings revealed that (1) with no recovery, PE film residues could increase by 480 kg hm\u22122, whereas achieving a 95% recovery rate could limit residues increasing to below the national threshold of 75 kg hm\u22122, outperforming the 80%, 85%, and 90% recovery rates. On the other hand, using PBAT film would maintain the increasing MFRs below 75 kg hm\u22122 regardless of recovery rate. (2) Without PE film recovery, CEEs would intensify significantly, as both the direct and indirect effects increase notably, while the CEEs of MFRs could maintain the current status or decrease under the strategy of 95% recovery rate of PE film and using PBAT film, similar to the variation of direct effects. However, indirect effects would persist due to ongoing microplastics (MPs) and phthalate esters (PAEs) released from residual films. Overall, a 95% PE film recycling rate and PBAT film usage emerged as particularly effective strategies for minimizing MFRs accumulation and mitigating ecological impacts over the next 50 years. Further research should prioritize the indirect ecological effects of MFRs, given their persistence despite reduction efforts.

Microplastics can enter the soil system in different ways and present different shapes and concentrations. However, little is known about how plants react to microplastics with different concentrations and shapes. To this end, we conducted a factorial pot experiment with wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in which we mixed polystyrene (PS) in different shapes (bead, fiber and powder) with soil at concentrations of 0, 1, 3 and 5%. Although all shapes of PS significantly reduced morphological growth traits, PS in powder shape was the microplastic that reduced plant height (by 58\u201360%), fresh biomass (by 54\u201355%) and dry biomass (by 61\u201362%) the most, especially at the 3% and 5% concentrations compared with 0% PS. Similar negative effects were also observed for root length and fresh root weight at the 3% and 5% concentrations, regardless of shape. A concentration-dependent reduction in the leaf area index (LAI) was also observed. Interestingly, increasing the PS concentration tended to up-regulate the activity of antioxidant enzymes for all shapes, indicating potential complexity and a highly time-dependent response related to various reactive oxygen species (ROS). Importantly, PS at the 5% concentration caused a significant reduction in chlorophyll pigmentation and photosynthetic rate.

Among HMs, chromium (Cr) is one of the most prevalent toxic trace metals found in agricultural soils because of anthropogenic activities, lack of efficient treatment, and unregulated disposal. It has a huge detrimental impact on the physiological, biochemical, and molecular traits of crops, in addition to being carcinogenic to humans. In soil, Cr exists in different forms, including Cr (III) \u201ctrivalent\u201d and Cr (VI) \u201chexavalent\u201d, but the most pervasive and severely hazardous form to the biota is Cr (VI). Despite extensive research on the effects of Cr stress, the exact molecular mechanisms of Cr sensing, uptake, translocation, phytotoxicity, transcript processing, translation, post-translational protein modifications, as well as plant defensive responses are still largely unknown. Even though plants lack a Cr transporter system, it is efficiently accumulated and transported by other essential ion transporters, hence posing a serious challenge to the development of Cr-tolerant cultivars. In this review, we discuss Cr toxicity in plants, signaling perception, and transduction. Further, we highlight various mitigation processes for Cr toxicity in plants, such as microbial, chemical, and nano-based priming. We also discuss the biotechnological advancements in mitigating Cr toxicity in plants using plant and microbiome engineering approaches. Additionally, we also highlight the role of molecular breeding in mitigating Cr toxicity in sustainable agriculture.

On physiological and biophysical grounds, exposure to higher levels of humidity should worsen heat stress by decreasing sweat evaporation. However, population-scale epidemiological studies of heat exposure and response often do not detect associations between high levels of humidity and heat-related mortality or morbidity. These divergent, disciplinary views regarding the role of humidity in heat-related health risks limit confidence in selecting which interventions are effective in reducing health impacts and in projecting future heat-related health risks. Objectives: Via our multidisciplinary perspective we seek to a) reconcile the competing realities concerning the role of humidity in heat-related health impacts and b) help ensure robust projections of heat-related health risks with climate change. These objectives are critical pathways to identify and communicate effective approaches to cope with present and future heat challenges. Discussion: We hypothesize six key reasons epidemiological studies have found little impact of humidity on heat\u2013health outcomes: a) At high temperatures, there may be limited influence of humidity on the health conditions that cause most heat-related deaths (i.e., cardiovascular collapse); b) epidemiological data sets have limited spatial extent, a bias toward extratropical (i.e., cooler and less humid), high-income nations, and tend to exist in places where temporal variations in temperature and humidity are positively correlated; c) analyses focus on older, vulnerable populations with sweating, and thus evaporative, impairments that may be further aggravated by dehydration; d) extremely high levels of temperature and humidity (seldom seen in the historical record) are necessary for humidity to substantially impact heat strain of sedentary individuals; e) relationships between temperature and humidity are improperly considered when interpreting epidemiological model results; and f) sub-daily meteorological phenomena, such as rain, occur at high temperatures and humidity, and may bias epidemiological studies based on daily data. Future research must robustly test these hypotheses to advance methods for more accurate incorporation of humidity in estimating heat-related health outcomes under present and projected future climates. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP11807", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-05-01", "synthetic_support_claim": "Epidemiological studies often do not detect associations between high humidity and heat-related mortality or morbidity.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Increased humidity is the primary factor driving heat-related mortality in populations under future climate scenarios."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "27fbf858095c816852bd016ff7958ee54a52d091", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/27fbf858095c816852bd016ff7958ee54a52d091", "title": "The Impact of Residential Building Insulation Standards on Indoor Thermal Environments and Heat-Related Illness Risks During Heatwaves: A Case Study in Korea", "abstract": "This study investigates the impact of building insulation standards on indoor thermal environments and the risk of heat-related illnesses during heatwaves in South Korea. Indoor temperatures were measured in residential buildings located in Chuncheon and Gwangju during the 2022 heatwave, with outdoor temperature data sourced from the Korea Meteorological Administration. Probability distribution fitting was used to estimate the likelihood of indoor temperatures exceeding the critical threshold of 27 \u00b0C. Additionally, a linear regression analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between the probability of exceeding the threshold and heat-related illness data from 2017 to 2023 provided by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency. The findings reveal significant variations in indoor thermal conditions during heatwaves, influenced by factors such as building type, year of construction, and climate region, which affect the thermal insulation performance. Buildings with a lower thermal insulation performance were associated with higher indoor temperatures, increasing the likelihood of exceeding the critical threshold and contributing to a higher incidence of heat-related illnesses, particularly in provincial non-metropolitan areas.

However, human activities continuously threaten this natural resource. In an attempt to unravel the extent of the impact of human-related activities on groundwater physicochemical characteristics in Nnewi and Awka urban clusters (Nigeria), several techniques were integrated in this study. Groundwater samples were warm and acidic in nature. Concentrations of SO42-, NO3-, PO43-, Cl-, HCO3-, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+ and K+ were within set benchmarks. The water nutrient pollution index (ranging from 0.060 to 0.745), nitrate pollution index (varying between \u22120.999 and \u22120.790) and water pollution index (ranging from 0.057 to 0.630) estimated the extent of anthropogenic contamination and showed low anthropogenic impact on the groundwater physicochemical characteristics. The health risks due to the ingestion and skin absorption of the nitrate-contaminated water computed for six age groups (6\u201312\u2009months, 5\u201310\u2009years, 10\u201315\u2009years, 15\u201320\u2009years, 20\u201360\u2009years and >60\u2009years) showed health risk values that were < 1, implying low chronic health risks to humans. The cumulative total health hazard index ranged between 0.006 and 0.787 with a mean value of 0.167. Chemometric analyses and geochemical plots revealed the relationships between the variables and contamination sources. Chadha\u2019s plot showed that 55% of the samples were Ca2+-Mg2+-Cl- waters, predominating over Na+-Cl- and Ca2+-Mg2+-HCO3- waters. Bivariate and multivariate geochemical plots also indicated low anthropogenic impact. Furthermore, principal component analysis and R-type hierarchical clustering confirmed that the groundwater chemistry and quality were mostly influenced by geogenic processes than human-related acts.

Here we outline the multi-faceted intervention approaches that have developed in Australia since 2017, from newly implemented in-water programs, research to enhance coral resilience and investigations into socio-economic perspectives on restoration goals. We describe in-water projects using coral gardening, substrate stabilisation, coral repositioning, macro-algae removal, and larval-based restoration techniques. Three areas of research focus are also presented to illustrate the breadth of Australian research on coral restoration, (1) the transdisciplinary Reef Restoration and Adaptation Program (RRAP), one of the world\u2019s largest research and development programs focused on coral reefs, (2) interventions to enhance coral performance under climate change, and (3) research into socio-cultural perspectives. Together, these projects and the recent research focus reflect an increasing urgency for action to confront the coral reef crisis, develop new and additional tools to manage coral reefs, and the consequent increase in funding opportunities and management appetite for implementation. The rapid progress in trialling and deploying coral restoration in Australia builds on decades of overseas experience, and advances in research and development are showing positive signs that coral restoration can be a valuable tool to improve resilience at local scales (i.e., high early survival rates across a variety of methods and coral species, strong community engagement with local stakeholders). RRAP is focused on creating interventions to help coral reefs at multiple scales, from micro scales (i.e., interventions targeting small areas within a specific reef site) to large scales (i.e., interventions targeting core ecosystem function and social-economic values at multiple select sites across the Great Barrier Reef) to resist, adapt to and recover from the impacts of climate change.

Batch sorption tests were conducted by adding individual PFCAs and a PFCA-mixture to pure biochars and mixtures of biochar and a sandy soil (1.3% TOC).

Low-volatility compounds, however, such as heavy metals (HMs; As, Cd, Cu, Cr, Ni, Pb, and Zn) typically accumulate in biochars, limiting their application potential, especially for soil improvement. The distribution of HMs in pyrolysis products is influenced by treatment temperature and the properties of both the HMs and the feedstock. There is a significant knowledge gap in our understanding of the mass balances of HMs in full-scale industrial pyrolysis systems. Therefore, the fate of HMs during full-scale relevant pyrolysis (500\u2013800 \u00b0C) of seven contaminated feedstocks and a clean wood feedstock were investigated for the first time. Most of the HMs accumulated in the biochar (fixation rates (FR) >70%), but As, Cd, Pb, and Zn partly partitioned into the flue gas at temperatures \u2265 600 \u00b0C, as demonstrated by FRs of <30% for some of the feedstocks. Emission factors (EFs, mg per tonne biochar produced) for particle-bound HMs (<0.45 \u00b5m) were 0.04\u20137.7 for As, 0.002\u20130.41 for Cd, 0.01\u2013208 for Pb, and 0.09\u2013342 for Zn. Only minor fractions of the HMs were found in the condensate (0\u201311.5%). To investigate the mobility of HMs accumulated in the biochars, a novel leaching test for sustained pH drop (at pH 4, 5.5 and 7) was developed. It was revealed that increasing pyrolysis temperature led to stronger incorporation of HMs in the sludge-based biochar matrix: after pyrolysis at 800 \u00b0C, at pH 4, <1% of total Cr, Cu, Ni, and Pb and < 10% of total As and Zn contents in the biochars were leached. Most interestingly, the high HM mobility observed in wood-based biochars compared to sewage-sludge-based biochars indicates the need to develop specific environmental-management thresholds for soil application of sewage-sludge biochars. Accordingly, more research is needed to better understand what governs the mobility of HMs in sewage-sludge biochars to provide a sound basis for future policy-making.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-06-19", "synthetic_support_claim": "Increasing pyrolysis temperature strengthens HM incorporation in sludge-based biochar, reducing their leachability at pH 4.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Pyrolysis completely eliminates heavy metals from contaminated organic waste, making the biochar safe for soil use."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "53115c5c2e5a22212f9c99faff78642ed2746e2a", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/53115c5c2e5a22212f9c99faff78642ed2746e2a", "title": "Sustainable Management of Poly- and Perfluoroalkyl Substances (PFASs)-Contaminated Areas: Tackling a Wicked Environmental Problem", "abstract": "This study evaluates the reasons and factors making soil pollution by poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) a wicked problem, reflecting upon the nature, persistence, mobility, and bioaccumulative properties of these compounds.

For non-dual pilot cities, the separate implementation of APPCAP or ETS only exerts significant unilateral effects. (2) Enhancing government supervision, weakening the relationship between government and enterprises, and raising enterprises\u2019 green innovation capabilities are the main mechanisms through which policy coordination can significantly influence pollution and carbon reduction.
