If zero-shot LLMs can also reliably classify and explain social phenomena like persuasiveness and political ideology, then LLMs could augment the computational social science (CSS) pipeline in important ways. This work provides a road map for using LLMs as CSS tools. Towards this end, we contribute a set of prompting best practices and an extensive evaluation pipeline to measure the zero-shot performance of 13 language models on 25 representative English CSS benchmarks. On taxonomic labeling tasks (classification), LLMs fail to outperform the best fine-tuned models but still achieve fair levels of agreement with humans. On free-form coding tasks (generation), LLMs produce explanations that often exceed the quality of crowdworkers\u2019 gold references. We conclude that the performance of today\u2019s LLMs can augment the CSS research pipeline in two ways: (1) serving as zero-shot data annotators on human annotation teams, and (2) bootstrapping challenging creative generation tasks (e.g., explaining the underlying attributes of a text).

In this work, we investigate the feasibility of state-of-the-art LLMs for depressive symptom extraction in pediatric settings (ages 6-24). This approach aims to complement traditional screening and minimize diagnostic errors. Our findings show that all LLMs are 60% more efficient than word match, with Flan leading in precision (average F1: 0.65, precision: 0.78), excelling in the extraction of more rare symptoms like\"sleep problems\"(F1: 0.92) and\"self-loathing\"(F1: 0.8). Phi strikes a balance between precision (0.44) and recall (0.60), performing well in categories like\"Feeling depressed\"(0.69) and\"Weight change\"(0.78). Llama 3, with the highest recall (0.90), overgeneralizes symptoms, making it less suitable for this type of analysis. Challenges include the complexity of clinical notes and overgeneralization from PHQ-9 scores. The main challenges faced by LLMs include navigating the complex structure of clinical notes with content from different times in the patient trajectory, as well as misinterpreting elevated PHQ-9 scores.

We investigate this question using persona-based prompting strategies in multimodal hate-speech detection tasks, specifically focusing on hate speech in memes. Our analysis reveals that when mapping personas onto a political compass and measuring persona agreement, inherent political positioning has surprisingly little correlation with classification decisions.

However, the extent and conditions under which LLMs deviate from empirical positions have not been thoroughly examined. To address this gap, our study systematically investigates the factors contributing to LLMs' deviations from empirical positions on political issues, aiming to quantify these deviations and identify the conditions that cause them. Drawing on cognitive science findings related to representativeness heuristics -- where individuals readily recall the representative attribute of a target group in a way that leads to exaggerated beliefs -- we scrutinize LLM responses through this heuristics lens. We conduct experiments to determine how LLMs exhibit stereotypes by inflating judgments in favor of specific political parties. Our results indicate that while LLMs can mimic certain political parties' positions, they often exaggerate these positions more than human respondents do. Notably, LLMs tend to overemphasize representativeness to a greater extent than humans.

We also examined the number of abortion clinics, trends in medication abortion and service disruptions and changes in abortion protocols that occurred during the COVID\u201019 pandemic. We compare these findings to those of our prior Abortion Provider Census, which collected information for 2017. Results We documented 930,160 abortions in 2020, an 8% increase from 2017. Between 2017 and 2020, abortion incidence increased in all four regions of the country and in a majority of states. The total number of clinics providing abortion care remained stable nationally but increased in the Midwest and the West and declined in the Northeast and South. There were 492,210 medication abortions in 2020, a 45% increase from 2017. A substantial minority of clinics adjusted protocols in response to COVID, most commonly adopting remote pre\u2010 and post\u2010abortion counseling.

Period Covered 2022. Description of System Each year, CDC requests abortion data from the central health agencies for the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and New York City. For 2022, a total of 48 reporting areas voluntarily provided aggregate abortion data to CDC. Of these, 47 reporting areas provided data each year during 2013\u20132022. Census and natality data were used to calculate abortion rates (number of abortions per 1,000 women aged 15\u201344 years) and ratios (number of abortions per 1,000 live births), respectively. Abortion-related deaths from 2021 were assessed as part of CDC\u2019s Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System (PMSS). Results For 2022, a total of 613,383 abortions were reported to CDC from 48 reporting areas. Among 47 reporting areas with data each year during 2013\u20132022, in 2022, a total of 609,360 abortions were reported, the abortion rate was 11.2 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15\u201344 years, and the abortion ratio was 199 abortions per 1,000 live births. From 2021 to 2022, the total number of abortions decreased 2% (from 622,108 total abortions), the abortion rate decreased 3% (from 11.6 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15\u201344 years), and the abortion ratio decreased 2% (from 204 abortions per 1,000 live births). From 2013 to 2022, the total number of reported abortions decreased 5% (from 640,154), the abortion rate decreased 10% (from 12.4 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15\u201344 years), and the abortion ratio increased 1% (from 198 abortions per 1,000 live births). In 2022, women in their 20s accounted for more than half of abortions (56.5%). Women aged 20\u201324 and 25\u201329 years accounted for the highest percentages of abortions (28.3% and 28.2%, respectively) and had the highest abortion rates (18.1 and 18.7 abortions per 1,000 women aged 20\u201324 and 25\u201329 years, respectively). By contrast, adolescents aged <15 years and women aged \u226540 years accounted for the lowest percentages of abortions (0.2% and 3.6%, respectively) and had the lowest abortion rates (0.4 and 2.5 abortions per 1,000 women aged <15 and \u226540 years, respectively). However, abortion ratios were highest among adolescents (aged \u226419 years) and lowest among women aged 30\u201339 years. From 2021 to 2022, abortion rates decreased among women aged \u226520 years and did not change among adolescents (aged \u226419 years). Abortion rates decreased from 2013 to 2022 among all age groups, except women aged 30\u201334 years for whom it increased. The decrease in the abortion rate from 2013 to 2022 was highest among adolescents compared with other age groups. From 2021 to 2022, abortion ratios increased for adolescents and decreased among women aged \u226520 years. From 2013 to 2022, abortion ratios increased among adolescents and women aged 20\u201334 years and decreased among women aged \u226535 years. In 2022, the majority (78.6%) of abortions were performed at \u22649 weeks\u2019 gestation, and nearly all (92.8%) were performed at \u226413 weeks\u2019 gestation. During 2013\u20132022, the percentage of abortions performed at >13 weeks\u2019 gestation remained low (\u22648.7%). In 2022, the highest percentage of abortions were performed by early medication abortion at \u22649 weeks\u2019 gestation (53.3%), followed by surgical abortion at \u226413 weeks\u2019 gestation (35.5%), surgical abortion at >13 weeks\u2019 gestation (6.9%), and medication abortion at >9 weeks\u2019 gestation (4.3%); all other methods were uncommon (<0.1%). Among those that were eligible (\u22649 weeks\u2019 gestation), 70.2% of abortions were early medication abortions. In 2021, the most recent year for which PMSS data were reviewed for pregnancy-related deaths, five women died as a result of complications from legal induced abortions. Interpretation Among the 47 areas that reported data continuously during 2013\u20132022, overall decreases were observed over this time in the number and rate of reported abortions and an increase was observed in the abortion ratio; in addition, from 2021 to 2022, decreases of 2%\u20133% were observed across all measures.

To evaluate the association between distance from closest abortion facility and number of fulfilled requests through no-test telehealth medication abortion (NTMA) asynchronous service. Methods. Using deidentified 2020-2022 electronic medical record data from Aid Access users in US states where NTMA is prescribed by US-based clinicians, we describe individual user demographics and their resident county characteristics. We conducted a county-level geospatial analysis of distance to abortion facility (Myers Abortion Facility Database) on fulfilled requests using Poisson regression. Results. US-based clinicians fulfilled NTMA requests to 8411 individuals in 21 states and the District of Columbia. Each 100-mile increase in distance to an abortion facility increased per-capita NTMA by 61% (95% confidence interval [CI]\u2009=\u200926%, 86%). Most individuals were aged 20 to 29\u2009years (54%), had no living children (57%), were less than 6\u2009weeks' gestation (62%), and lived in urban areas (65%). Almost half (49%) lived in higher socially vulnerable counties compared with 17% in less socially vulnerable counties. Conclusions. In the United States, telehealth medication abortion is a critically important service for individuals who are young, socially vulnerable, and living in counties far from abortion care facilities.

This paper introduces a novel 5-tier prompting approach leveraging a foundational Large Language Model to automate the screening process. First, each study is assigned to one of five classes based on its likelihood of meeting predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Using a specified threshold, these classifications are then converted into binary decisions. This approach minimizes the risk of excluding relevant papers while automatically excluding the majority of irrelevant ones.Evaluation conducted on 5,643 records from four published systematic reviews resulted in zero wrong excludes when compared to human full-text screening decisions. The executed experiments resulted in a 68% average reduction in human workload, which enables a 50% decrease in the time needed to complete the screening process, all without compromising the accuracy of the results.

This study examines how increased participation can be possible for children with disabilities throughout the Swedish Disability Act (SDA) assessment process. Eleven children and twelve parents were interviewed, using Talking Mats with the children. Malterud\u2019s phenomenological method was used for analysing the data. Children feel they are listened to, but they need support expressing what they find difficult, and believe Augmentative and Alternative Communication can support their understanding. When planning a meeting, children need information beforehand to be involved in the planning. Parents believe that children should be involved in decision-making; hence, their own involvement is needed.

Although transnational agreements and national policy are necessary for a transition to a fully decarbonized global economy, fluctuating political priorities and lobbying by vested interests have slowed these efforts. Against this backdrop, bottom-up pressure from social movements and shifting social norms may offer a complementary path to a more sustainable economy. Furthermore, norm change may be an important component of decarbonization policies by accelerating or strengthening the impacts of other demand-side measures. Individual actions and policy support are social processes\u2014they are intimately linked to expectations about the actions and beliefs of others.

How do social networks tip? A popular theory is that a small minority can trigger population-wide social change. This aligns with the Pareto principle, a semi-quantitative law which suggests that, in many systems, 80\u2009% of effects arise from 20\u2009% of the causes. In the context of the transition to net-zero emissions, this vital 20\u2009% can be a critical instigator of social tipping, a process which can rapidly change social norms. In this work, we asked whether the Pareto effect can be observed in social systems by conducting a literature review, placing a focus on social norm diffusion and complex contagion via social networks. By analysing simulation and empirical results of social tipping events across disciplines and a large parametric space, we identified consistent patterns across studies and key factors which help or hinder social tipping. We show evidence supporting a tipping point near 25\u2009% of the total population within our compiled dataset. Near this critical mass, we observe a high likelihood for a social tipping event, where a large majority quickly adopts new norms. Our findings illustrate slight variations between modelling and empirical results, with average tipping points at 24\u2009% and 27\u2009%, respectively. Additionally, we show a range of critical masses where social tipping is possible; these values lie between 10\u2009% and 43\u2009%. These results indicate the potential, but not the inevitability, of rapid social change in certain susceptible populations and contexts. Finally, we provide practical guidance for facilitating difficult norm changes by (1)\u00a0leveraging trusted community structures and building critical mass in clustered networks (particularly in the 10\u2009%\u201343\u2009% threshold range), (2)\u00a0adapting strategies based on norm type and context, and (3)\u00a0targeting groups with moderate preferences and network positions \u2013 avoiding reliance on highly central or well-connected individuals \u2013 to enable endogenous spread.\n", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2025-01-28", "synthetic_support_claim": "A social tipping point is likely near 25% of the total population.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "A small minority of 5% can trigger population-wide social change in any social network."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "990f1f4052e68b65c99f27f35e74fd9ef1662edd", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/990f1f4052e68b65c99f27f35e74fd9ef1662edd", "title": "Asymmetric ideological segregation in exposure to political news on Facebook", "abstract": "Does Facebook enable ideological segregation in political news consumption?

To address these challenges, at least three building blocks for the regulation of frontier models are needed: (1) standard-setting processes to identify appropriate requirements for frontier AI developers, (2) registration and reporting requirements to provide regulators with visibility into frontier AI development processes, and (3) mechanisms to ensure compliance with safety standards for the development and deployment of frontier AI models.

Traditional threat modeling approaches require expert intervention and manual effort, often leading to inefficiencies and human error. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a promising avenue for automating these processes, enhancing both efficiency and efficacy. However, this transition is not straightforward due to three main challenges: (1) the lack of publicly available, domain-specific datasets, (2) the need for tailored models to handle complex banking system architectures, and (3) the requirement for real-time, adaptive mitigation strategies that align with compliance standards like NIST 800-53. In this paper, we introduce ThreatModeling-LLM, a novel and adaptable framework that automates threat modeling for banking systems using LLMs. ThreatModeling-LLM operates in three stages: 1) dataset creation, 2) prompt engineering and 3) model fine-tuning. We first generate a benchmark dataset using Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool (TMT). Then, we apply Chain of Thought (CoT) and Optimization by PROmpting (OPRO) on the pre-trained LLMs to optimize the initial prompt.

Although the concept of political bias and affiliation is hard to define, lacking an agreed-upon measure for its quantification, this contribution attempts to examine this issue by having ChatGPT respond to questions on commonly used measures of political bias. In addition, further measures for personality traits that have previously been linked to political affiliations were examined. More specifically, ChatGPT was asked to answer the questions posed by the political compass test as well as similar questionnaires that are specific to the respective politics of the G7 member states. These eight tests were repeated ten times each and indicate that ChatGPT seems to hold a bias towards progressive views. The political compass test revealed a bias towards progressive and libertarian views, supporting the claims of prior research. The political questionnaires for the G7 member states indicated a bias towards progressive views but no significant bias between authoritarian and libertarian views, contradicting the findings of prior reports. In addition, ChatGPT\u2019s Big Five personality traits were tested using the OCEAN test, and its personality type was queried using the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) test. Finally, the maliciousness of ChatGPT was evaluated using the Dark Factor test.

Legislation was identified by searching for terms related to psychedelics (eg, psilocybin, MDMA, peyote, mescaline, ibogaine, LSD, ayahuasca, and DMT). Bills were coded by an attorney along 2 axes: which psychedelic drugs would be affected and in what ways (eg, decriminalization, funding for medical research, and right to try). To explore drivers and rates of legislative reform, data were compared with other state indices including 2020 presidential voting margins and marijuana legislative reform.\n\n\nFindings\nTwenty-five states have considered 74 bills (69 legislative initiatives, 5 ballot measures); 10 bills were enacted, and 32 were still active. The number of psychedelic reform bills introduced during each calendar year increased steadily from 5 in 2019 to 6 in 2020, 27 in 2021, and 36 in 2022. Nearly all bills specified psilocybin (67 [90%]), and many also included MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine; 27 [36%]). While bills varied in their framework, most (43 [58%]) proposed decriminalization, of which few delineated medical oversight (10 of 43 [23%]) or training and/or licensure requirements (15 of 43 [35%]). In general, bills contained less regulatory guidance than the enacted Oregon Measure 109. While early legislative efforts occurred in liberal states, the margin between liberal and conservative states has decreased over time (although the difference was not significant), suggesting that psychedelic drug reform is becoming a bipartisan issue. In addition, an analytic model based on marijuana legalization projected that a majority of states will legalize psychedelics by 2034 to 2037.\n\n\nConclusions and Relevance\nLegislative reform for psychedelic drugs has been proceeding in a rapid, patchwork fashion in the US. Further consideration should be given to key health care issues such as establishing (1) standards for drugs procured outside the medical establishment, (2) licensure criteria for prescribers and therapists, (3) clinical and billing infrastructure, (4) potential contraindications, and (5) use in special populations like youths, older adults, and pregnant individuals.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-12-07", "synthetic_support_claim": "A majority of states will legalize psychedelics by 2034 to 2037 based on marijuana legalization trends.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Psychedelic drugs are scientifically proven to be more effective than traditional treatments for all mental health disorders."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "a8da9fda647713ba08394cf605ef4ba87ba786ac", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a8da9fda647713ba08394cf605ef4ba87ba786ac", "title": "The Use of Classic Psychedelics for Depressive and Anxiety-Spectrum Disorders: A Comprehensive Review.", "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nFollowing a decades-long decline in psychedelic research resulting from social, political, and legislative factors, there has been greatly renewed interest in these compounds' ability to treat psychiatric disorders.

The Amazon is currently perched to transition rapidly from a largely forested to a nonforested landscape.

Description Losing the Amazon The Amazon rainforest is a biodiversity hotspot under threat from ongoing land conversion and climate change. Two Analytical Reviews in this issue synthesize data on forest loss and degradation in the Amazon basin, providing a clearer picture of its current status and future prospects. Albert et al. reviewed the drivers of change in the Amazon and show that anthropogenic changes are occurring much faster than naturally occurring environmental changes of the past. Although deforestation has been widely documented in the Amazon, degradation is also having major impacts on biodiversity and carbon storage. Lapola et al. synthesized the drivers and outcomes of Amazon forest degradation from timber extraction and habitat fragmentation, fires, and drought. \u2014BEL Two Reviews spotlight the threats of ongoing deforestation and degradation in the Amazon. BACKGROUND The Amazon is a critical component of the Earth climate system whose fate is embedded within that of the larger planetary emergency. The Amazon is the most species-rich subcontinental-scale ecosystem and is home to more than 10% of all named plant and vertebrate species, concentrated into just 0.5% of Earth\u2019s surface area. The Amazon rainforest is also a critical component of the Earth climate system, contributing about 16% of all terrestrial photosynthetic productivity and strongly regulating global carbon and water cycles. Amazonian ecosystems are being rapidly degraded by human industrial activities. A cumulative total of 17% of the original forest have already been cleared, and 14% replaced, by agricultural land use. After millions of years serving as an immense global carbon pool, under further warming the Amazon rainforest is predicted to become a net carbon source to the atmosphere. Some regions have already made the transition, with forest respiration and burning outpacing forest photosynthesis. ADVANCES In this Review, we compare rates of anthropogenic and natural environmental changes in the Amazon and South America and in the larger Earth system. We focus on deforestation and carbon cycles because of their critical roles on the Amazon and Earth systems. Data for South America were compiled for the Science Panel for the Amazon (SPA) Assessment Report, which details the many dimensions of the Amazon as a regional entity of the Earth system. The SPA report, coauthored by 240 scientists from 20 countries, documents epoch-scale transformations in Amazonian biodiversity, ecosystem function, and cultural diversity. We found that rates of anthropogenic processes that affect Amazonian ecosystems are up to hundreds to thousands of times faster than other natural climatic and geological phenomena. These anthropogenic changes reach the scale of millions of square kilometers within just decades to centuries, as compared with millions to tens of millions of years for evolutionary, climatic, and geological processes. The main drivers of Amazonian habitat destruction and degradation are land-use changes (such as land clearing, wildfires, and soil erosion), water-use changes (such as damming and fragmenting rivers and increased sedimentation from deforestation), and aridification from global climate change. Additional important threats come from overhunting and overfishing, introduction of invasive exotic species, and pollution from the mining of minerals and hydrocarbons. OUTLOOK Given the outsized role of the Amazon in our planetary hydrological cycle, large-scale deforestation of this region is expected to push the whole Earth system across a critical threshold to a qualitatively different global climate regime. Quite aside from biodiversity losses, such a transformation will have multifarious and catastrophic consequences for human welfare, including widespread water and food insecurity that will lead to mass migrations and political instability. The key message is that Amazonian environments are being degraded by human industrial activities at a pace far above anything previously known, imperiling its vast biodiversity reserves and globally important ecosystem services. The Amazon is now perched to transition rapidly from a largely forested to a nonforested landscape, and the changes are happening much too rapidly for Amazonian species, peoples, and ecosystems to respond adaptively. Policies to prevent the worst outcomes are known and must be enacted immediately. We now need political will and leadership to act on this information. To fail the Amazon is to fail the biosphere, and we fail to act at our peril. Amazon deforestation is accelerating from a combination of anthropogenic drivers, including drier climatic conditions and policies that favor industrialized agriculture.

Using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and object-based image classification, yearly LULC maps were created from 2018 to 2023. Disturbances were then quantified by Primary Forest conversions. This study revealed a gain of around 22,362 ha in Secondary Forest areas in Manaus and 29,088 ha in Agriculture/Pastureland in Porto Velho within the study period. Differing yearly rates of deforestation and degradation were detected between the areas, with agriculture/pastureland expansion being observed as the primary driver of forest loss. State and federal units showed the largest conversion of primary to Secondary Forest, while state units experienced the most conversion to non-forest areas. Sustainable use units and buffer zones were particularly impacted by these disturbances. These findings suggest that factors beyond environmental policies contribute to these outcomes, highlighting the importance of understanding local contexts.

The integrity of river systems has been threatened in profound ways over the last century. Pollution, damming, canalisation, and water grabbing are some examples of pressures threatening the entwined lifeworlds of human and non-human communities that depend on riverine systems. Finding ways to reverse the trends of environmental degradation demands complex spatial\u2013temporal, political, and institutional articulations across different levels of governance (from local to global) and among a plurality of actors who operate from diverse spheres of knowledge and systems of practice, and who have distinct capacities to affect decision-making. In this context, grassroots river initiatives worldwide use new multi-actor and multi-level dialogue arenas to develop proposals for river regeneration and promote social-ecological justice in opposition to dominant technocratic-hydraulic development strategies. This paper conceptualises these spaces of dialogue and action as RCAs and critically reflects on ways of organising and supporting RCAs while facilitating their cross-fertilisation in transdisciplinary practice. By integrating studies, debates, and theories from diverse disciplines, we generate multi-faceted insights and present cornerstones for the engagement with and/or enaction of RCAs.

The problem is important, as providing reasons to believe that AI systems are worthy of trust is key to appropriately rely on these systems in human-AI interactions. In our approach, we consider the trustworthiness of an AI as a time-relative, composite property of the system with two distinct facets. One is the actual trustworthiness of the AI and the other is the perceived trustworthiness of the system as assessed by its users while interacting with it. We show that credences, namely, beliefs we hold with a degree of confidence, are the appropriate attitude for capturing the facets of the trustworthiness of an AI over time. Then, we introduce a reliabilistic account providing justification to the credences in the trustworthiness of AI, which we derive from Tang\u2019s probabilistic theory of justified credence. Our account stipulates that a credence in the trustworthiness of an AI system is justified if and only if it is caused by an assessment process that tends to result in a high proportion of credences for which the actual and perceived trustworthiness of the AI are calibrated. This approach informs research on the ethics of AI and human-AI interactions by providing actionable recommendations on how to measure the reliability of the process through which users perceive the trustworthiness of the system, investigating its calibration to the actual levels of trustworthiness of the AI as well as users\u2019 appropriate reliance on the system.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-11-21", "synthetic_support_claim": "Credences capture the facets of AI trustworthiness over time and provide justification for trust assessments.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "AI systems can be considered autonomous moral agents capable of independent ethical decision-making."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "f74792302d886e375d857910a2d54710fb877480", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f74792302d886e375d857910a2d54710fb877480", "title": "A Teleological Interpretation of the Definition of DeepFakes in the EU Artificial Intelligence Act\u2014A Purpose\u2010Based Approach to Potential Problems With the Word \u201cExisting\u201d", "abstract": "The EU Artificial Intelligence Act is the world's first attempt to holistically regulate artificial intelligence.

The AI Act uses concepts that leave room for interpretation, which is important given the constant development of technology and the need for adjustments. However, some solutions raise the problem of vagueness, which in turn may result in a narrower interpretation of a linguistic nature, and reduce the scope of legally permissible countermeasures. The aim of this study is to critically evaluate the definition of deepfakes contained in the AI Act in relation to the word \u201cexisting\u201d used. A narrow interpretation could potentially exclude some synthetic media from the scope of transparency obligations due to the non\u2010classification of these media as deepfakes. Therefore, a teleological interpretation of the provisions is proposed, reinforced with elements of systemicity, so that the safeguards built by the AI Act also include deepfakes that do not depict any identifiable pre\u2010existing persons, objects, places, entities or events to better reflect goals of the regulation, and complement the value\u2010based system of the AI Act.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-01-15", "synthetic_support_claim": "The EU AI Act's deepfake definition may exclude some synthetic media, potentially narrowing transparency obligations.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "The AI Act minimizes the threat of deepfakes to public trust and democratic institutions."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "72a220ed1bb23555988a8fb37663d12bfa808b68", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/72a220ed1bb23555988a8fb37663d12bfa808b68", "title": "Decolonizing energy justice from the ground up: Political ecology, ontology, and energy landscapes", "abstract": "The purpose of the paper is to expand the concept of energy justice by considering the struggles over coloniality and cultural identity in the Global South and their interactions with the spatial and historical development of energy systems and the ongoing forms of energy transitions.

To be transformative, energy justice must be articulated from the politics of actually existing unsustainability.

Despite its perceived \u201cpositive\u201d implications, CEG has often been instrumentalized, undermining its potential to transform the spatialities of the existing energy system more democratic. By critically reviewing how the concept of community is mobilized regarding CEG, we seek to delineate how this mobilization entails a degree of romanticization. We then offer an alternative conceptualization of community by drawing upon a post-foundational understanding of space and community, particularly theorizations by Jean-Luc Nancy. We argue that understanding CEG through his ontology of \u201cbeing-with,\u201d which demands a world where every singularity can expose itself, can create a space for the political. In other words, this ontological understanding reconceptualizes CEG as a contingent political disruptibility of the existing order, rather than merely an institution, or politics. This provides a fundamental guideline to avoid instrumental appropriations of the concept of community and grounds more critical conceptualizations of community in energy and environmental geographies.

Aims This review aims to describe experiences of health system development efforts in the MENA region, highlight progress, identify challenges that need be addressed and future opportunities to achieve responsive and efficient health systems. It also aimed to provide recommendations to further support these health systems toward evolution and performance improvement. Methods A literature review was conducted by searching different databases including PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar and other electronic resources to identify articles and publications describing health systems development in the MENA region from 1975 to 2022. It also included grey literature, reports and policy and planning documents by international organizations. The identified references were reviewed to extract, analyze, organize and report the findings. Results The review revealed emerging evidence describing governmental initiatives to introduce health system reforms at different levels in the MENA countries. These include initiatives targeting the various elements controlling health system reform: financing, payment, organization, regulation and behavior of providers and consumers. There are several challenges facing the health systems of MENA countries including the rising burden of chronic diseases, inequitable access to health services, deficiency in health workforce, shortage in the use of effective health information systems and leadership challenges. The review identified several key areas that can benefit from further improvement to support health system reforms. These include improving the structure, organization and financing of health systems, health workforce development, effective data management and engagement of key stakeholders to achieve adequate health system reforms.

In turn, this raises questions about the impact of inter\u2010firm ties within, rather than between, national contexts, and in settings where progress towards renewables has been uneven and contested. Accordingly, we explore how common institutional ownership may foster collaboration among firms within the same industry against climate change. Using a sample of US\u2010listed firms from 2006 to 2019, we obtain robust evidence that firms with industrial peers that are owned by the same institutional investors have lower carbon emissions. In addition, we find that a threshold exists for which the impact on carbon emissions holds only when firms are commonly connected with a substantial number of peers. The existence of this threshold suggests potential free\u2010riding issues and highlights the beneficial role of investors in promoting cross\u2010industry collaboration.

What motivates people to share high-quality news, and how can these motives be leveraged to promote news sharing? Based on the theory that self-related and social motives encourage sharing behavior, we designed and tested interventions to increase news sharing. In the interventions, individuals were exposed to actual news stories and were prompted to identify why the content was relevant to themselves (self-relevance) or people they know (social relevance). Across four studies (Nparticipants = 2,559, Nobservations = 18,780), we systematically examined the effectiveness of these interventions, their generalizability across news topics (climate change and health) and cultures (the United States of America and the Netherlands), their translation to more naturalistic contexts, and their underlying neuropsychological mechanisms. In all studies, we observed expected positive correlations among perceived self and social relevance and sharing intentions. In a neuroimaging study, we also observed corresponding increases in activity in self-referential and social cognitive brain regions. Using the content-framing interventions to test causal relationships, we found that the interventions increased sharing intentions and behavior. Furthermore, we observed generalizability across news topics and cultural contexts and translation to an ecologically valid news exposure context.

This shortcoming reflects a broader lack of research on the experiences of marginalized groups within TikTok\u2019s logics and affordances, and what functions the platform fulfills for these communities. Against this backdrop, this study examines TikTok\u2019s role as a platform for Muslim female content creators in Germany and its broader implications for marginalized communities. Our research is guided by the following questions: (a) What are the main themes and topics that are being brought forward by Muslim women content creators on TikTok? (b) What technical affordances do they use to communicate their content? (c) What functions does TikTok fulfill for Muslim women as an intersectionally marginalized group?.We analyze 320 videos from 32 public TikTok accounts identified through snowball sampling. Data collection includes automated web scraping, manual transcription, and qualitative coding. This allows us to identify main topics, video formats, and content types to answer our research questions.Our findings show that Muslim women produce diverse content on TikTok, ranging from beauty and lifestyle to religious education and social justice.

In a societal crisis such as COVID\u201019, it is important to understand the drivers behind citizens\u2019 attitudes and behaviours. Political disagreement related to COVID\u201019 restrictions and lockdowns has often been interpreted as an ideological or partisan divide along the left\u2010right dimension of political opinion. Here, we argue that there is more to unpack. There is increasing awareness that public opinion is structured by both left\u2010right orientation and trust in the system. In this paper, we examine the divide in COVID\u201019 attitudes and behaviours and compare the influence of ideology and system trust as drivers across countries and across time during the pandemic. Based on monthly surveys from eight countries (the United States, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, France and Italy) from September 2020 to July 2021 (total sample of 49,414 respondents), we show that citizens with right\u2010wing ideologies and those who do not trust \u2018the system\u2019 perceived a lower threat from the coronavirus, were less supportive of government measures against the virus, report having changed their behaviour less and report lower intentions to vaccinate against COVID\u201019 compared to citizens with left\u2010wing ideologies and those with high system trust. These results are stable across time and across countries.

One of the primary limitations of EBFM is the incorporation of basic lower trophic level information, particularly for zooplankton, despite the importance of zooplankton to fish. The generation of zooplankton abundance estimates requires significant time and expertise to generate. The rapid zooplankton assessment (RZA) is introduced as a tool whereby nontaxonomic experts may produce rapid zooplankton counts shipboard that can be applied to management in near real time. Zooplankton are rapidly counted shipboard and placed into three broad groups of zooplankton relevant to higher trophic levels: large copepods (>\u20092\u2009mm), small copepods (<\u20092\u2009mm), and euphausiids. A Bayesian, hierarchical linear regression modeling approach was used to validate the relationship between RZA abundances and laboratory\u2010processed abundances to ensure the rapid method is a reliable indicator. Additional factors likely to impact the accuracy of the RZA abundance predictions were added to the initial regression model: RZA sorter, survey, season, and large marine ecosystem (Bering Sea, Chukchi/Beaufort Sea, and Gulf of Alaska). We tested models that included the random effect of sorter nested within survey, which improved fits for both large copepods (Bayes R2\u2009=\u20090.80) and euphausiids (Bayes R2\u2009=\u20090.84). These factors also improved the fit for small copepods when the fixed effect of season was also included (Bayes R2\u2009=\u20090.65). Additional RZA data were used to predict laboratory\u2010processed abundances for each zooplankton category and the results were consistent with model training data: large copepods (Bayes R2\u2009=\u20090.80), small copepods (Bayes R2\u2009=\u20090.64), and euphausiids (Bayes R2\u2009=\u20090.88). The Bayesian models were therefore able to predict laboratory\u2010processed abundances with an associated error when accounting for these fixed and random effects. To demonstrate the utility of zooplankton data in management, zooplankton time series from the Bering Sea shelf were shown to vary in relation to warm and cold conditions. This variability impacted commercially important fish, notably Walleye Pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus), and these time series were used by managers using a risk table approach. The RZA method provides a rapid zooplankton population estimation in near real time that can be applied to the management process quickly, thus helping to fill a gap in EBFM.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2024-11-04", "synthetic_support_claim": "The rapid zooplankton assessment (RZA) provides near-real-time zooplankton estimates applicable to ecosystem-based fisheries management.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "The RZA method improves the overall health and sustainability of global fish populations."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "539a76316346624e6ca7d6b3faefae4798cd5fac", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/539a76316346624e6ca7d6b3faefae4798cd5fac", "title": "Going down the rabbit hole: insight into the future of Paramecium (Ciliophora, Protista) biodiversity surveys", "abstract": "Paramecium, a research subject in many areas of life sciences, appeared to be a ciliate genus with a well known biodiversity structure.

The MTT assay measured cytotoxic activity, while DCFH-DA and nitric oxide assays were employed to determine reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) levels using African green monkey kidney (VERO) and human keratinocyte (HaCat) cell lines. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) were assessed in seven clinical isolates and nine ATCC strains. Biofilm inhibition was tested against four biofilm-forming strains. The antioxidant properties of the methanolic extract were identified as follows: 35.74\u2009mg GAE/g (gallic acid equivalents)/g for total phenols, 10.5\u2009\u00b5g/ml for DPPH, and 50.68\u2009\u00b5mol trolox/\u00b5g for ABTS\u2022+. The mean inhibitory concentration (IC50) values were 622.86\u2009\u00b5g/ml (VERO) and 784.33\u2009\u00b5g/ml (HaCat). These concentrations did not markedly alter levels of ROS and RNS.

These far-reaching expectations lead to a discussion on the societal and political impact of AI that is largely dominated by unfocused fears and enthusiasms. In contrast, this article provides a framework for a more focused and productive analysis and discussion of AI\u2019s likely impact on one specific social field: democracy. First, it is necessary to be clear about the workings of AI. This means differentiating between what is at present a largely imaginary AGI and narrow artificial intelligence focused on solving specific tasks. This distinction allows for a critical discussion of how AI affects different aspects of democracy, including its effects on the conditions of self-rule and people\u2019s opportunities to exercise it, equality, the institution of elections, and competition between democratic and autocratic systems of government. This article shows that the consequences of today\u2019s AI are more specific for democracy than broad speculation about AGI capabilities implies.

The main idea behind the adoption of AI is that it can make journalists\u2019 work more efficient, freeing them up from some repetitive or routine tasks while enhancing their research and storytelling techniques. Against this idea, and drawing on the concept of \u201chype\u201d, we employ a critical reflection on the lens often used to talk about journalism and AI. We suggest that the severe sustainability crisis of journalism, rooted in growing pressure from platforms and major corporate competitors, changing news consumption habits and rituals and the growing technologization of news media, leads to the obsessive pursuit of technology in the absence of clear and research-informed strategies which cater to journalism\u2019s civic role. As AI is changing and (re)shaping norms and practices associated with news making, many questions and debates are raised pertaining to the quality and plurality of outputs created by AI. Given the disproportionate attention paid to technological innovation with little interpretation, the present article explores how AI is impacting journalism. Additionally, using the political economy framework, we analyze the fundamental issues and challenges journalism is faced with in terms of both practices and professional sustainability. In the process, we untangle the AI hype and attempt to shed light on how AI can help journalism regain its civic role. We argue that despite the advantages AI provides to journalism, we should avoid the \u201cshiny things perspective\u201d, which tends to emphasize productivity and profitability, and rather focus on the constructive synergy of humans and machines to achieve the six or seven things journalism can do for democracy.

An online survey showed a notable decline in the students' mental health status, with around 50% experiencing at least moderate levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. Changes in occupations, occupational meaning, and balance were also common. The study found that satisfaction with life, mental resilience, occupational balance, religious status, executive functions, and variability in occupational change all contributed directly to the students' mental health status.

Public perceptions of AI are often shaped either by admiration for its benefits and possibilities, or by uncertainties, potential threats and fears about this opaque and perceived as mysterious technology. Understanding the public perception of AI, as well as its requirements and attributions, is essential for responsible research and innovation and enables aligning the development and governance of future AI systems with individual and societal needs. Methods To contribute to this understanding, we asked 122 participants in Germany how they perceived 38 statements about artificial intelligence in different contexts (personal, economic, industrial, social, cultural, health). We assessed their personal evaluation and the perceived likelihood of these aspects becoming reality. Results We visualized the responses in a criticality map that allows the identification of issues that require particular attention from research and policy-making. The results show that the perceived evaluation and the perceived expectations differ considerably between the domains. The aspect perceived as most critical is the fear of cybersecurity threats, which is seen as highly likely and least liked. Discussion The diversity of users influenced the evaluation: People with lower trust rated the impact of AI as more positive but less likely.

These tools can write and explain code, enhance error messages, create resources for instructors, and even provide feedback and help for students like a traditional teaching assistant. In 2024, new research started to emerge on the effects of GenAI usage in the computing classroom. These new data involve the use of GenAI to support classroom instruction at scale and to teach students how to code with GenAI.

This paper estimates future smoking prevalence, mortality inequality and health-adjusted life year (HALY) impacts of these strategies. Methods We used a Markov model to estimate future yearly smoking and vaping prevalence, linked to a proportional multistate life table model to estimate future mortality and HALYs. Results The combined package of strategies (plus media promotion) reduced adult smoking prevalence from 31.8% in 2022 to 7.3% in 2025 for M\u0101ori, and 11.8% to 2.7% for non-M\u0101ori. The 5% smoking prevalence target was forecast to be achieved in 2026 and 2027 for M\u0101ori males and females, respectively. The HALY gains for the combined package over the population\u2019s remaining lifespan were estimated to be 594\u2009000 (95% uncertainty interval (UI): 443\u2009000 to 738\u2009000; 3% discount rate). Denicotinisation alone achieved 97% of these HALYs, the retail strategy 19% and tobacco-free generation 12%.

Although smoking prevalence continues to decline across most developed countries, socioeconomic inequalities in smoking still persist. While Ireland is among a small number of countries with a tobacco-endgame goal set to achieve a smoking prevalence of 5% by 2025, the challenge this presents by socioeconomic status is uncharted.\n\n\nAIMS AND METHODS\nWe analyzed how differences in smoking status across various socioeconomic groups have changed over time in the adult population in Ireland. We used cross-sectional smoking data from the national population-based Healthy Ireland Survey for 2015-2022 (n\u2005=\u200552\u00a0494). Educational attainment and area-based deprivation were used as socioeconomic indicators. Socioeconomic differences and changes in inequality over time were identified using the relative index of inequality (RII). Multinomial logistic regression was used to analyze the association between socioeconomic status and daily smoking, occasional smoking, former smoking, and never smoking with adjustment for sex, age, and survey year.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe observed the highest daily smoking rates among the least educated (OR\u2005=\u200511.62; 95% CI\u2005=\u20059.91, 13.63) and individuals living in the most deprived areas (OR\u2005=\u20054.23; 95% CI\u2005=\u20053.55, 5.04). Additionally, we identified significant relative smoking inequalities over the observation period continued to increase, among the least educated (RII\u2005=\u20052.86, 95%CI\u2005=\u20052.63, 3.09) and individuals living in the most deprived areas (RII\u2005=\u20052.64, 95% CI\u2005=\u20052.36, 2.93).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nDespite generally reducing smoking prevalence, socioeconomic inequalities continue to widen among the smoking population in Ireland.\n\n\nIMPLICATIONS\nAs the tobacco endgame deadline of 2025 is fast approaching, this study highlights the urgent need to consider potential effects across the lowest socioeconomic status groups when implementing equity-oriented tobacco control policies.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2024-11-21", "synthetic_support_claim": "Despite declining smoking prevalence, socioeconomic inequalities in smoking are widening among Ireland's smoking population.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Socioeconomic inequalities in smoking rates will be completely eliminated by implementing equity-oriented tobacco control policies."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "42dd1777160fdf4cb70e649e6cb7d570f441fd56", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/42dd1777160fdf4cb70e649e6cb7d570f441fd56", "title": "UK policymaker and expert perspectives on the smoke-free generation policy: a qualitative study", "abstract": "The UK smoke-free generation (SFG) proposal seeks to ban the sale of tobacco products to those born in or after 2009.

This study explores the context in which UK may be the first country to introduce SFG, identifies potential barriers and facilitators to SFG implementation and outlines possible approaches to SFG policy design.We conducted 19 qualitative semistructured interviews with policymakers and health leaders in England, Scotland and Wales, including politicians, public health experts, academics, trading standards experts (responsible in UK for enforcing age restrictions on products), clinicians and civil society (charity sector) representatives. Data were analysed through Kingdon\u2019s three policy streams (problem, policy and political) and organised using the framework approach.Participants conceptualised SFG as both addressing youth tobacco initiation and shifting societal norms. They agreed that all tobacco products should be included but had differing views on including e-cigarettes. Opinions on enforcement varied. Some believed minimal enforcement would suffice due to anticipated compliance, while others stressed the need for strong enforcement. All agreed enforcement should target retailers, not individuals. Politically, participants noted the rapid shift from advocates supporting Tobacco 21 to embracing SFG after government endorsement. Cohesive public health advocacy, maintaining cross-party support and public opinion and developing broader tobacco control policies were considerations for successful implementation.Widespread support for SFG across expert, political and public opinion provides a strong foundation for its passing into law.

While existing approaches to artificial self-awareness often rely on heuristic implementations or philosophical abstractions, we present a formal framework grounded in metric space theory, measure theory, and functional analysis. Our framework posits that self-identity emerges from two mathematically quantifiable conditions: the existence of a connected continuum of memories $C \\subseteq \\mathcal{M}$ in a metric space $(\\mathcal{M}, d_{\\mathcal{M}})$, and a continuous mapping $I: \\mathcal{M} \\to \\mathcal{S}$ that maintains consistent self-recognition across this continuum, where $(\\mathcal{S}, d_{\\mathcal{S}})$ represents the metric space of possible self-identities. To validate this theoretical framework, we conducted empirical experiments using the Llama 3.2 1B model, employing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for efficient fine-tuning. The model was trained on a synthetic dataset containing temporally structured memories, designed to capture the complexity of coherent self-identity formation. Our evaluation metrics included quantitative measures of self-awareness, response consistency, and linguistic precision. The experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements in measurable self-awareness metrics, with the primary self-awareness score increasing from 0.276 to 0.801.

We found that most studies used previously existing datasets. Twitter (now X) has been the most widely used source for collecting social media misinformation data. The ten most frequently used datasets are identified. Most studies (96.1%) developed or applied machine learning, especially deep learning models. The most advanced current misinformation detection models could achieve pretty high performance.

This is to develop a robust and efficient clustering algorithm that addresses the challenges of energy consumption and network performance in WSNs. The K-BCO algorithm outperformed comparative clustering algorithms such as H-LEACH, DBCP, and ABC-ACO in average error rate (AER), average data delivery rate (ADDR), and average energy consumption (AEC) for transmitting data packets from sensors to cluster heads. The K-BCO outperformed other algorithms in terms of ADDR at 95.00% against H-LEACH (75.86%), DBCP (72.07%) and ABC-ACO (90.08%).

Second, policymakers can bolster the trustworthiness of health care markets and organizations by using their regulatory\u00a0authority to address and mitigate harm from conflicts-of-interest and regulatory capture. Third, policymakers and government agencies can further safeguard the public's trust by being transparent and effective about their role in the provision of health services to the public.\n\n\nCONTEXT\nTrust plays a critical role in facilitating health care delivery and calls for rebuilding trust in health care are increasingly commonplace. This article serves as a primer on the trust literature for health policymakers, organizational leaders, clinicians, and researchers based on the long history of engagement with the topic among health policy and services researchers.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a synthetic review of the health services and health policy literatures on trust since 1970. We organize our findings by trustor-trustee dyads, highlighting areas of convergence, tensions and contradictions, and methodological considerations. We close by commenting on the challenges facing the study of trust in health care, the potential value in borrowing from other disciplines, and imperatives for the future.\n\n\nFINDINGS\nWe identified 725 articles for review. Most focused on patients' trust in clinicians (n = 499), but others explored clinicians' trust in patients (n = 11), clinicians' trust in clinicians (n = 69), and clinician/patient trust in organizations (n = 19) and systems (n = 127). \u00a0Across these five subliteratures, there was lack of consensus about definitions, dimensions, and key attributes of trust. Researchers leaned heavily on cross-sectional survey designs, with limited methodological attention to the relational or contextual realities of trust. Trust has most commonly been treated as an independent variable related to attitudinal and behavioral outcomes. We suggest two challenges have limited progress for the field: (1) conceptual murkiness in terms and theories, and (2) limited observability of the phenomena. Insights from philosophy, sociology, economics, and psychology offer insights for how to advance both the theoretical and empirical study of health-related trust.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nConceptual clarity and methodological creativity are critical to advancing health-related trust research.

Semi-structured interviews with meeting attendees were conducted after observing and documenting meeting conduct. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to interpret data and generate a thematic map of findings.\n\n\nRESULTS\nForty-four interviews and 32 meeting observations were conducted between July 2019 and January 2020. Participants valued collaboration between attendees in Morbidity and Mortality meetings, however there were barriers to this. They included differing views about roles and negative impacts of hierarchies and authority. Senior doctors dominated discussion, and participants described this occasionally signalling reverence and respect, but sometimes signified intimidation and feeling unsure about how to contribute. Because of this complexity, successfully achieving positive social dynamics in a meeting required active promotion and management.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nMorbidity and Mortality meetings mirror the complexity and richness of the clinical environment. Descriptions of how meeting conduct can shape positive workplace culture and address hierarchical obstructions to safe clinical care highlight their far-reaching potential. Effective collaboration is an intrinsic part of realising this value.\n\n\nIMPACT\nThis paper addresses a paucity in the literature in understanding how social dynamics and collaboration in Morbidity and Mortality meetings are interpreted and experienced. These findings illuminate challenges and obstacles to achieving a productive and equitable social dynamic in meetings. They also illustrate positive discrimination strategies that may improve participation and widespread engagement of nurses, junior doctors, and allied health professionals.

The Johns Hopkins School of Nursing\u2019s Center for Community Programs, Innovation, and Scholarship (COMPASS Center) provides free wellness services, aiming to address healthcare disparities in the neighborhoods. Objective To delineate the types and cost of wellness services provided by the COMPASS Center. Methods The study employed a secondary analysis design, utilizing Qualtrics surveys to assess wellness service data from 2017 to 2022 at two main program sites\u2014Wald center and House of Ruth, Maryland. Results The analysis covered 2,194 encounters (826 at Wald center and 1,368 at House of Ruth, Maryland). Most encounters at both sites served African American/African/Black and low-income individuals. Examples of wellness services included pre-employment exams and immunizations, health literacy and self-care management education, health insurance advice, parenting support, and referrals to community resources. Cost analysis revealed varying expenses per encounter, with medium costs ranging from $5.45 to $14.91 across sites, considering service type and duration, including staff salaries, encounter numbers, and service hours. Conclusion The COMPASS Center delivers essential wellness services supplementing traditional healthcare to disadvantaged community members through student engagement and academic support. The next generation of healthcare teams is learning with and from the community creating a holistic educational experience in building skills outside of institutional bedsides. Future plans involve structured training for students and center staff to provide wellness services, while expanding social service referrals.

Specifically, it presents the role of the stock market and banking sector in shaping economic stability and defense capabilities.\nMethodology/approach: Drawing on insights from institutional economics, this research employs a\u00a0comparative analysis of market institutions in Ukraine and other Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries. The study is based on data from the stock market and banking sector to assess their performance and implications for national security. Additionally, the Axelrod tournament framework is applied to analyze strategic behavior within these institutions. This analysis incorporates the utilization of various Python packages to delve into the complexities of the situation. The market of arms manufacturers is selected as an illustration of missed opportunities. Optimization of portfolios was carried out based on the maximization of the Sharpe ratio. At the same time, indicators Sortino, Max Drawdown, Calmar were used for testing alternative approaches.\nFindings: The analysis reveals significant shortcomings in Ukraine\u2019s market institutions, particularly in the stock market and banking sector. Weaknesses such as underrepresentation of defense companies and other sectors in the stock market and high levels of nonperforming loans in the banking sector pose serious challenges to national security.

The products and services of unhealthy commodity industries (UCIs) such as tobacco, alcohol, ultra-processed foods and beverages and gambling are responsible for much of this health burden. While effective public health policies are available to address this, UCIs have consistently sought to stop governments and global organisations adopting such policies through what is known as corporate political activity (CPA). We aimed to contribute to the study of CPA and development of effective counter-measures by formulating a model and evidence-informed taxonomies of UCI political activity. Methods: We used five complementary methods: critical interpretive synthesis of the conceptual CPA literature; brief interviews; expert co-author knowledge; stakeholder workshops; testing against the literature. Results: We found 11 original conceptualisations of CPA; four had been used by other researchers and reported in 24 additional review papers. Combining an interpretive synthesis of all these papers and feedback from users, we developed two taxonomies \u2013 one on framing strategies and one on action strategies. The former identified three frames (policy actors, problem, and solutions) and the latter six strategies (access and influence policy-making, use the law, manufacture support for industry, shape evidence to manufacture doubt, displace, and usurp public health, manage reputations to industry\u2019s advantage). We also offer an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of UCI strategies and a model that situates industry CPA in the wider social, political, and economic context. Conclusion: Our work confirms the similarity of CPA across UCIs and demonstrates its extensive and multi-faceted nature, the disproportionate power of corporations in policy spaces and the unacceptable conflicts of interest that characterise their engagement with policy-making.

Most studies focus on high-income settings. There were a limited number of primary peer-reviewed empirical studies that explicitly aimed to study the practices of the pesticide industry from a CDOH perspective.

It analyzes mainly the evolution of production over the years, areas of knowledge, authors and their affiliations, methodological approaches, countries and jurisdictions and research topics explored.\n\n\nFindings\nPR in the public sector is a topic still in an early stage of research (only 19 papers in the last eighteen years), by a very limited number of authors. Studies have mainly focused the USA and the local governments. Qualitative methods, namely case studies, have prevailed. Most of the empirical approaches have addressed possible characteristics and content of the PR. Non-empirical papers broadly have suggested PR as a tool to increase accountability.\n\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nGiven its potential contribution to accountability in the public sector, it seems important that PR becomes an institutionalized practice. For this, it is necessary to deeper understand and study this matter. The development of effective practice guidance and standards by regulators and the like, would be leveraged by the contribution of academics by increasing research on this topic. The research would benefit from more authors interested in the topic and an extension to countries other than the USA and Italy, and jurisdictions other than the local governments.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nTo the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge, no study so far has sought to characterizing the existing research on PR in the public sector. This study contributes by identifying trends and gaps in this research field, proposing topics for future development, which can help academics to develop research that adds to the advancement of this field. Research gaps identified point to a need to empirically confirm the impact of PR on accountability. Also, exploring about the content of PR may in the future include, among other topics, the perspective of the politicians and public managers.

The notion of justified representation (JR) demands that any large\"cohesive\"group of voters should be proportionally\"represented\". The\"cohesiveness\"is defined in different ways; two common ways are the following: (C1) demands that the group unanimously approves a set of candidates proportional to its size, while (C2) requires each member to approve at least a fixed fraction of such a set. Similarly,\"representation\"have been considered in different ways: (R1) the coalition's collective utility from the winning set exceeds that of any proportionally sized alternative, and (R2) for any proportionally sized alternative, at least one member of the coalition derives less utility from it than from the winning set. Three of the four possible combinations have been extensively studied: (C1)-(R1) defines Proportional Justified Representation (PJR), (C1)-(R2) defines Extended Justified Representation (EJR), (C2)-(R2) defines Full Justified Representation (FJR).

We investigate FPJR's properties and find that it shares PJR's advantages over EJR: several proportionality axioms (e.g. priceability, perfect representation) imply FPJR and PJR but not EJR.

This urban\u2013rural divide in values has become one of the major fault lines in Western democracies, underpinning major political events of the last decade, not least the election of Donald Trump. Yet, beyond a small number of countries, there is little evidence that cities really are more liberal than rural areas. Evolutionary modernisation theory suggests that socio-economic development may lead to the spread of progressive, self-expression values but provides little guidance on the role of cities in this process. Has an urban\u2013rural split in values developed across the world? And does this gap depend on the economic development of a country? We answer these questions using a large cross-sectional dataset covering 66 countries.

The Penta-Helix model involves collaboration between academics, business, community, government, and media. The research aims to provide theoretical contributions to the development of the Penta-Helix concept and practical recommendations for stakeholders in optimizing collaboration to support BUMDesa development. The study employs a qualitative approach, with data collected through Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) involving representatives from each actor in the Penta-Helix collaboration. The findings reveal that each actor has specific roles and contributions, such as academics as conceptors, businesses as enablers, communities as accelerators, government as regulators and controllers, and media as expanders. Although the Penta-Helix collaboration in developing BUMDesa in Maros Regency has not reached an optimal stage, there is great potential for further development. The collaboration shows synergy and resource exchange that can drive innovation and sustainability in BUMDesa development. However, challenges remain, such as the not-yet-optimal role of media in publication and promotion, and the need to strengthen commitment and involvement of various parties in the collaboration. The study suggests several strategic steps to optimize the Penta-Helix collaboration, including strengthening synergy and coordination, increasing human resource capacity, optimizing the role of media, strengthening government support, encouraging active community participation, developing strategic partnerships, and conducting regular monitoring and evaluation.

The specific objectives are: (1) to describe and compare levels of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among the general population in rural and urban settings in West Africa over time and (2) to identify factors associated with COVID-19 vaccination willingness and hesitancy among the general population across five West African countries over time. Design Following a baseline survey (Wave I), three serial cross-sectional surveys (Waves II-IV) were implemented. Setting The study was conducted in Burkina Faso, Guinea, Mali, Senegal and Sierra Leone from November 2021 to July 2022. Participants A total of 13\u2009571 study participants were included in the study (n=4373, n=4593 and n=4605 for survey Waves II, III and IV, respectively). Inclusion criteria were being 18 years or older, living in the study area and willing to provide informed consent. A two-stage sampling strategy was used to select the sample from among the general population. Primary and secondary outcomes Primary outcomes were the variability of vaccine hesitancy over time and across the five West African countries. Secondary outcomes were factors associated with vaccine willingness. Results A small but steady increase in hesitancy to COVID-19-vaccination can be observed across countries, with an upward trend of vaccine hesitancy reported by 952 participants (33.9 %) in Wave II, 1055 (37.3%) in Wave III and 1089 (38.1%) in Wave IV. Among the countries included, Senegal shows the highest level of vaccine hesitancy (\u2018Definitely no\u2019 and \u2018Probably no\u2019 ranging from 50.2% to 56.0% and 26.2 to 28.3%, respectively). At the same time, Senegal has the lowest vaccination coverage overall. Across all five countries and survey waves, the primary factor associated with vaccination willingness is fear of experiencing severe COVID-19 disease (Wave II: OR 0.42, 95%\u2009CI 0.34 to 0.51, Wave III: OR 0.48, 95%\u2009CI 0.40 to 0.59 and Wave IV: OR 0.54, 95%\u2009CI 0.44 to 0.66). Perceived improved financial status seems to influence willingness to get vaccinated negatively (OR 0.57, 95%\u2009CI 0.40 to 0.81) and unlike in Western, Educated, Industrialised, Rich and Democratic countries, men seem more reluctant to get vaccinated than women (OR 0.77, 95%, CI 0.65 to 0.93). Conclusions Our findings suggest that vaccine hesitancy should be monitored over time to inform communication strategies, which are responsive to changes in vaccination-related public sentiments. Additionally, a focus on social solidarity and the importance of women in vaccination advocacy can help improve COVID-19 vaccination coverage in West Africa.

Scholars have examined immigrants\u2019 marginalization as a form of civic stratification, where boundaries based on documentation status affect immigrants\u2019 experiences and benefits granted by the state. This scholarship lacks a framework outlining existing documentation status categories and does not fully answer three research questions I pose in this article: (1) what is the alignment of documentation status categories relative to each other, (2) how does policy (re)configure those categories over time, and (3) how have documentation status categories shaped access to health care in the United States? This article answers those questions and argues that the documentation status continuum (DSC) framework fills these gaps. In the DSC, undocumented immigrants are at one end and citizens are at the other, with many documentation statuses in between. Public policy creates these statuses and generates stratification through allocating benefits based on one\u2019s DSC position. Policy also shapes movement along the continuum, which shapes benefits eligibility. Using the 2006 Massachusetts Health Reform and national 2010 Affordable Care Act (ACA) Reform as policy examples and interviews conducted with 207 immigrants, healthcare professionals, and immigrant organization employees in Boston, this article demonstrates how healthcare access is stratified along the DSC between citizens and noncitizens.

Among respondents who expressed a \"great deal\" of trust, that trust was not related primarily to agencies' ability to control the spread of COVID-19 but, rather, to beliefs that those agencies made clear, science-based recommendations and provided protective resources. Scientific expertise was a more commonly reported reason for \"a great deal\" of trust at the federal level, whereas perceptions of hard work, compassionate policy, and direct services were emphasized more at the state and local levels. Although trust in public health agencies was not especially high, few respondents indicated that they had no trust. Lower trust was related primarily to respondents' beliefs that health recommendations were politically influenced and inconsistent. The least trusting respondents also endorsed concerns about private-sector influence and excessive restrictions and had low trust in government overall.

Degrowth calls for a radical reorganization of politics and economics to reduce resource, energy consumption. This paper discusses the crisis of capitalism from multiple dimensions. It uses the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) as an approach to explain degrowth and green energy. It also explores green energy in terms of three aspects of sustainable development: the profit-making industry, the high-efficiency paradox, and the re-challenge to the environment. Finally, it discusses the possible pathways for society to solve the global environmental crisis in the context of degrowth.

The paper makes three main arguments. First, it situates digital capitalism as a continuation of longer running post-Fordist trends of financialization, digitalization, and privatization\u2014converging in the emergence of digital proprietary markets, owned and regulated by transnational platform companies. Second, as the platform model is founded on monopolizing regulation, platforms come into direct competition with states and public institutions, which they pursue through a set of distinct technopolitical strategies to claim power to govern\u2014resulting in a geographically variegated process of institutional transformation. Third, while the digital proprietary markets are continuities of existing trends, they bring new pressures and affordances, thus producing discontinuities in social regulation.

Although earmarking was initially purported to reduce donor fragmentation and enhance aid effectiveness, recent evidence suggests that it may undermine ownership. Despite formal commitments to ownership by multilateral institutions and bilateral donors within the Development Assistance Committee (DAC), earmarking potentially strengthens the responsiveness and accountability of international organizations to donors, thereby undermining recipient countries' ownership in formulating policy objectives, use of country\u2010led results frameworks, and implementation of aid through national systems. We test this expectation through a mixed\u2010methods approach. We first employ latent factor analysis on new data from two monitoring rounds of the Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation, covering 80 donors and 92 recipient countries, to measure ownership by the degree of donor\u2212recipient alignment. Our multivariate regression analysis then demonstrates that earmarked aid significantly reduces recipient\u2010country ownership. Further examination of institutional and DAC donor policies and discourses reveals limited recognition of the adverse effects of earmarked funding on ownership. We find evidence to support the notion that bilateral donors employ earmarking to both enhance their influence within international development organizations and to pursue national interests, inadvertently sidelining \u2018old\u2019 concerns about aid effectiveness and ownership.

Recent scholarship has explored whether these frames have diffused from radical-right to centrist parties in the latter\u2019s effort to compete for the former\u2019s voters. This study instead investigates whether similar frames had been used by mainstream political actors prior to their exploitation by the radical right (in the U.S., Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 and 2020 campaigns). To do so, we identify instances of populism, nationalism (i.e., exclusionary and inclusive definitions of national symbolic boundaries and displays of low and high national pride), and authoritarianism in the speeches of Democratic and Republican presidential nominees between 1952 and 2020. These frames are subtle, infrequent, and polysemic, which makes their measurement difficult. We overcome this by leveraging the affordances of neural language models\u2014in particular, a robustly optimized variant of bidirectional encoder representations from Transformers (RoBERTa) and active learning. As we demonstrate, this approach is more effective for measuring discursive frames than other methods commonly used by social scientists. Our results suggest that what set Donald Trump\u2019s campaign apart from those of mainstream presidential candidates was not the invention of a new form of politics, but the combination of negative evaluations of elites, low national pride, and authoritarianism\u2014all of which had long been present among both parties\u2014with an explicit evocation of exclusionary nationalism, which had been articulated only implicitly by prior presidential nominees.

Our analysis suggests that the Commission increasingly operates four major developmental functions akin to DNSs and aimed at promoting and protecting the single market. Neofunctionalist theories of EU integration explain these momentous shifts. The timing behind the rise of EU industrial policy is best explained as an interplay of functional, cultivated, and political spillovers, driven especially by the Franco-German realignment on pro-EU industrial policy positions since 2016.

Results Cannabis legalization in Canada has been followed by substantial reductions in cannabis\u2010related arrests and cannabis prices. It has also increased adults\u2019 access to a diverse range of cannabis products, including edibles and extracts. The prevalence of cannabis use among young adults has increased, but there have been no marked increases or decreases in use among high school students or changes in the prevalence of daily or near\u2010daily use.

While extant research has shown substantial heterogeneity in patterns of cannabis use among different user groups, far less research has examined self-regulation among users. The current study aims to identify sub-groups of individuals who used or have used cannabis based on how they perceive risks, monitor their impairment, and plan to avoid driving under the influence of cannabis (DUIC) to examine how the different profiles relate to DUIC outcomes.\n\n\nMETHODS\nParticipants were a Canadian sub-sample in the province of British Columbia who participated in the 2022 International Cannabis Policy study and reported ever using or currently using cannabis (N\u2009=\u2009886, Mage = 43.58, SDage = 13.67; 63% female).

The majority (51%) of participants showed moderate self-regulation with average levels of risk perception, monitoring, and planning.

Flood disasters are the most frequent disasters in Malaysia, especially during the monsoon seasons. The hard structure developed by Malaysia\u2019s National Security Council (MKN) under \u2018Directive 20\u2019 is used to manage disasters in the country. Although Malaysia has become more skillful in managing flood disasters, the frequent climate changes along with weakness in implementing flood risk management plans resulted in much losses and damages throughout the country. Therefore, this study explored the gaps and weaknesses in flood risk management (FRM) in Malaysia by reviewing the available literature to recommend better flood management. This study revealed four main issues which are weaknesses in terms of (i) coordination and communication, (ii) manpower and assets, (iii) public awareness, and (iv) power and authority among local authorities to implement flood management plans. The capacity of local authorities and individuals in charge of disaster management is inadequate, especially for flood risk preparedness and management. Hence, responsible individuals are also in a vulnerable situation to implement management plans or rescue operations when flood disasters occur since they are also flood victims. Thus, the National Disaster Management Agency (NADMA) which acts as the main coordinator of disaster management in Malaysia should re-examine the flood management plan to ensure that it can be implemented efficiently and effectively, especially at the local level as they are the first respondents on the scene when the disaster occurs. The combination of both structural and non-structural measures might require in many cases the management of flood disasters; however, the disaster risk preparedness and management of individuals via customized training is a must to prevent flood disasters as well as minimize their impact.

The risk to human lives is particularly high in low-lying areas and areas with poor drainage systems. Water contamination during floods can also lead to health issues and the spread of waterborne diseases. The psychological impact of floods should not be underestimated, as individuals may experience a range of emotions such as frustration, sadness, fear and anger. To address these challenges, this study focuses on developing a flood alert system using Internet of Things (IoT) technology. By utilizing ESP32 microcontroller, flow sensor, float sensors, water flow as well as water level can be accurately measured and users can be alerted through the Blynk application. The system ensures accuracy in measuring flow rates, with recorded values ranging from 2.404 L/min to 2.444 L/min.

Traditional flood management strategies, predominantly focused on engineering solutions, have proven inadequate in addressing evolving flood risks. Community-based flood mitigation (CBFM) has emerged as an alternative approach, leveraging local knowledge and public participation to enhance flood resilience. This study aims to evaluate the role of CBFM in Malaysia, focusing on the effectiveness of public involvement and policy implementation in flood risk management Methods We conducted 20 in-depth interviews with stakeholders, including government officials, community members, and representatives of non-governmental organisations (NGOs), using a qualitative methodology. The data were analysed using thematic analysis to identify key themes surrounding public participation, policy challenges, and successful community-led flood mitigation initiatives. Results The findings highlight the critical role of public involvement in improving flood preparedness and resilience. Communities that actively participated in mitigation efforts, such as early warning systems and nature-based solutions, demonstrated enhanced resilience. However, significant challenges remain, including inadequate funding, outdated infrastructure, and bureaucratic delays. Public awareness and education on flood preparedness, especially in rural areas, were found to be insufficient, hindering the effectiveness of flood management strategies. Conclusions The study concludes that while CBFM initiatives in Malaysia show promise, their success depends on stronger policy enforcement, increased public engagement, and sustained investments in both green and grey infrastructure. Greater collaboration between local communities, NGOs, and government agencies is essential for improving flood risk management and building long-term resilience, particularly in the face of increasing climate-driven disasters.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-12-20", "synthetic_support_claim": "Community-based flood mitigation enhances flood resilience through public involvement and local knowledge in Malaysia.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Engineering solutions are obsolete and should be completely replaced by community-based flood mitigation strategies."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "736b42d4f3695de31dcf8b550825df605e1789fb", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/736b42d4f3695de31dcf8b550825df605e1789fb", "title": "Sustainable development goals in public administrations: Enabling conditions in local governments", "abstract": "Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a challenge that many public administrations face in promoting sustainable growth.

However, the absence of ground truth about actual diffusion cascades makes verifying the efficacy of these efforts impossible.

Two case studies involving data from Twitter and Bluesky reveal that reconstructing cascades significantly alters the identification of influential users, therefore affecting downstream analyses in general. We also propose a novel reconstruction approach that allows us to evaluate the effects of different assumptions made during the cascade inference procedure. Analysis of the diffusion of over 40,000 true and false news stories on Twitter reveals that the assumptions made during the reconstruction procedure drastically distort both microscopic and macroscopic properties of cascade networks.

Ethical considerations arising from the Australian Government's use of behavioural insights and Robodebt", "abstract": "Behavioural insights and the use of nudge have attracted a lot of interest among governments across the globe since the introduction of the UK's Behavioural Insights Unit in 2010. One of the key challenges since these early days has been the concern that behavioural policy design, in particular the use of nudges, could be misused to manipulate citizens. When the Robodebt Royal Commission released its report in 2023, these concerns were renewed in Australia. It revealed that the Department of Human Services had used behavioural insights to inform the design of letters informing citizens of a debt in such a way as to minimise the impact on call centres while shifting that impact onto citizens. Did this use finally reveal what many had feared? Could government not be trusted with behavioural insights? This article will first explore the ethical concerns that have surrounded the implementation of nudges and behavioural policy. Following this, the paper will go beyond the debate over the ethics of implementing behavioural policies and argue instead that a focus on the theoretical opportunities and risks of nudge and behavioural policy fails to capture the significant risks inherent in implementation.

First, we delineate within new municipalism the target of our analytical gaze \u2013radical municipalism. Radical municipalism is not simply progressive policies happening in cities, and should not be conflated with pragmatic, entrepreneurial or state-centric perspectives. Rather, we argue it is a speculative hypothesis about how systemic transformation might be wrought through coordinated action at the urban or municipal scale, understood as a strategic entry-point for counter-hegemonic struggle. Key here is proximity and the politicisation and socialisation of proximate relations of encounter and assembly. Second, we delve deeper into what we identify as four salient dimensions marking this terrain \u2013 economic reorganisation, democratisation of political decision-making, feminisation of politics, ecological transformation \u2013 as a multi-dimensional lens through which to introduce, and situate within the wider literature, the 15 articles that comprise this double special issue.

Third, most current research does not use a multidimensional perspective to understand the adoption and implementation of AI in government organizations. Our study addresses these gaps by exploring the following question: what determinants facilitate or impede the adoption and implementation of chatbots in the public sector? We answer this question by analyzing 22 state agencies across the U.S.A. that use chatbots. Our analysis identifies ease of use and relative advantage of chatbots, leadership and innovative culture, external shock, and individual past experiences as the main drivers of the decisions to adopt chatbots. Further, it shows that different types of determinants (such as knowledge-base creation and maintenance, technology skills and system crashes, human and financial resources, cross-agency interaction and communication, confidentiality and safety rules and regulations, and citizens\u2019 expectations, and the COVID-19 crisis) impact differently the adoption and implementation processes and, therefore, determine the success of chatbots in a different manner.

The results of the multivariate analysis showed that utilisation of ANC (67% from public vs 18% from private health facilities), institutional delivery (64% from public vs 25% from private health facilities) and PNC (73% from public vs 27% from private health facilities) was significantly higher (p<0.001) in public than in private health facilities. Care seeking for ARI and diarrhoea among children was significantly higher (p<0.001) in private than in public health facilities; care for ARI was 68% in private health facilities compared with 32% in public health facilities. Conclusions A targeted approach is needed to enhance the competitiveness of private sectors, especially in maternity care markets, to ensure the sustainability of healthcare services in India. Strengthening both the private and public sectors is crucial, with a focus on improving care quality and addressing regional disparities in access to maternal and child health services.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-01", "synthetic_support_claim": "Utilisation of maternal healthcare services in India increased significantly between 2005\u20132006 and 2019\u20132021.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "The study demonstrates that public health facilities in India outperform private facilities in all MCH service indicators."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "16681fa5f076f0e4d67e5b7762f84359d806b8b5", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/16681fa5f076f0e4d67e5b7762f84359d806b8b5", "title": "Mating Call, Dog Whistle, Trigger: Asymmetric Alignments, Race, and the Use of Reactionary Religious Rhetoric in American Politics", "abstract": "Asymmetric social alignments are transforming American partisan rhetoric, particularly how politicians leverage identity-based appeals.

This paper proposes a first expert validated definition and three distinct dimensions that allow researchers to assess plant awareness and to identify and compare key influences on the construct across different socio\u2010cultural groups. With this improved framework, research can support initiatives to promote plant awareness in society, a critical step in addressing challenges such as the climate crisis.\nResearch on plant blindness, plant awareness disparity, and plant awareness is currently separated using different terminologies. Having different terms for the same construct is disadvantageous for research, as ambiguous constructs can lead to important research being overlooked.\nIn this study, we aim to provide a solution to this challenge by applying a Delphi study to integrate previous concepts into the new comprehensive construct of plant awareness. Delphi is a state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art method for reaching reliable expert consensus on multidisciplinary issues with its key features of anonymity, iterative questioning and feedback. Focusing on the methodology, we provide a transparent, and detailed, overview of how we applied this method to reach consensus on the plant awareness construct.\nAs an outcome of our Delphi study, we provide an expert validated definition of plant awareness that is based on previous constructs, research, and expert consensus. This definition constitutes three key dimensions: attention, understanding, and attitudes. Experts found consensus on these three dimensions, their definition, and how increased plant awareness is expressed in relation to each of the dimensions. Finally, we identified several factors that are key to raising plant awareness.\nThis validated definition alongside the differentiation of the three dimensions not only assists comprehension of previous research but for the first time opens the possibility of developing a valid and reliable tool to assess an individual's plant awareness.

There were implementation challenges, including delays in preauthorisations, loss of member details and exclusion and restrictions of interventions in the benefits package. Private providers also experienced overcrowding and reduced service quality. Providers perceived the service reimbursement levels as relatively cost-reflective, but some providers shifted models to maximise profits, including inducing demand to defraud the fund.

Equitable access to education and health services in disadvantaged communities requires comprehensive public policies that address multidimensional barriers. Through an innovative econometric analysis of primary data collected in 50 rural communities, the most influential factors hindering access to these basic services are identified. This article discusses the most effective public policy strategies for improving access to and the quality of education and health services in disadvantaged communities, and outlines how to implement them sustainably and equitably. The results reveal that a lack of adequate infrastructure, a shortage of qualified personnel, and socioeconomic and cultural barriers are the main obstacles. Based on these findings, a new comprehensive intervention model is proposed, which simultaneously addresses these interconnected barriers. These strategies contribute directly to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being) and SDG 4 (Quality Education), by addressing critical barriers to equitable access to essential health and education services in marginalized communities. These strategies are based on theories that highlight the importance of investing in education and health for human and economic development, and support the fact that investments in these sectors boost productivity, income, well-being, and equity.

Thus, unlike existing approaches for HTC, the encoder of RADAr has no explicit encoding of the label hierarchy and the decoder solely relies on the label sequences of the samples observed during training. We demonstrate on three benchmark datasets that RADAr achieves results competitive to the state of the art with less training and inference time. Our model consistently performs better when organizing the label sequences from children to parents versus the inverse, as done in existing HTC approaches. Our experiments show that neither the label semantics nor an explicit graph encoder for the hierarchy is needed. This has strong practical implications for HTC as the architecture has fewer requirements and provides a speed-up by a factor of 2 at inference time. Moreover, training a separate decoder from scratch in conjunction with fine-tuning the encoder allows future researchers and practitioners to exchange the encoder part as new models arise.

Following an affordance-based approach, we analyze all the TikToks published by the main candidates (Pedro Castillo, Keiko Fujimori, Rafael Lopez Aliaga, Hernando de Soto, and George Forsyth) during the electoral campaign, to understand if and how candidates have integrated this platform as part of their electoral strategy and what kind of content they publish and share.

Each regulatory document is analysed based on its underlying thermal comfort model, metric, and indices. The advantages and limitations of each document are practically discussed and for each legislative document and standard, and the quantitative measures have been reviewed, analysed, and summarised.

However, other critical environmental parameters, such as relative humidity, indoor air velocity, and physiological parameters including metabolic heat production and clothing insulation, are often not included. The absence of mandatory regulations for overheating criteria in residential buildings in some countries, such as in Australian homes, prompts the call for a holistic approach based on a thermal index inclusive of relevant environmental and physiological parameters to quantify heat stress exposure based on human thermal regulation. Gaps and limitations within existing guidelines are identified, and recommendations are proposed to strengthen the regulatory framework for overheating risk assessment in residential buildings.

An alternative \u2018Fortress Europe\u2019 vision aimed to carve out a sphere of relative European autonomy backed by trade barriers and industrial protectionism. While many argued that the \u2018Fortress Europe\u2019 vision was defeated during the globalization of the 1990s and 2000s, concepts such as economic sovereignty, industrial strategy and \u2018strategic autonomy\u2019 have returned to EU circles.

The increasing influence of China, coupled with its aspirations for global dominance, in addition to the challenge posed to the established liberal world order and the distribution of power, prompts us to explore the feasibility of utilising existing relationships as a means of economic coercion. Therefore, the research methodology employed in this study integrates complexities inherent in the realm of international political economy of trade and international economics.

Methods The study is an international cross-sectional Internet-based study completed by 3,325 MHCPs having provided direct clinical services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results 13.11% experienced OV. The most frequent type/source of OV was psychological violence inside the workplace (59.6% of those who reported OV). Risk factors for any type/source of OV being younger, working in emergency services, treating COVID-19 patients, and living in a lower to upper middle-income country. Emotional distress was higher in those who had experienced OV. Risk factors for emotional distress among those reporting OV included being younger and having experienced physical violence outside the workplace. Discussion Approximately one in ten MHCP experienced OV during the COVID-19 pandemic.

A great number of healthcare facilities have been destroyed, while availability of other ones is often limited due to a lack of qualified medical staff.

Moreover, millions of Ukrainians with chronic conditions are also suffering as due to war-related problems with execution of their long-term therapies. Availability of drugs is particularly limited in the occupied regions. According to the national statistics, as of 18 August 2022, about 505 pharmacies were damaged in Eastern Ukraine and 47 completely ruined. Moreover, the invaders have been blocking humanitarian aid provided to these territories by the Ukrainian government or other countries. Fortunately, in the areas controlled by the Government of Ukraine, the acute shortage of medicines, observed at the beginning of the war, has already been eliminated. Nevertheless, not all drugs are now fully available, even in the areas where no military attacks occur. The economic availability of drugs is also profoundly influenced by the significant increase in the cost of medications and the fall in average salaries. The Government of Ukraine is trying to minimise the impact of these war-related challenges by adopting a new legislation. This includes, among others, simplification of procedures for licensing, quality control and import of medicinal products to Ukraine. Other measures involve securing displaced people with the option of benefiting from local healthcare facilities, broadening the scope of the ePrescription system, authorizing primary care doctors to issue prescriptions to refugees, increasing the number of drugs reimbursed for long-term therapies, etc. These solutions, however, cannot balance all the harmful consequences the war in Ukraine brings in terms of maintenance of long-term therapies.

Background Millions of Ukrainian citizens sought safety in other countries when Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Introduction Nurses in Poland and the United States are positioned to provide nursing care for refugees from Ukraine yet lack intercultural knowledge, skills, and attitudes to meet refugee needs. Methods This education\u2010focused qualitative description study was conducted in Spring 2023. Eighteen MSN and BSN students from one university in Poland and one university in the United States completed an international virtual exchange course that concentrated on the health and well\u2010being of refugees from Ukraine. Students\u2019 reflection papers generated the data for this study. Content analysis was used to systematically structure the data, and themes were inductively derived for an initial understanding of intercultural care for refugees. The COREQ guidelines were followed for reporting study findings. Results Major themes were troubled communication, overlooked trauma\u2010informed care, and compromised vaccine status. Language differences, a gap in nursing knowledge, and cultural variations impeded intercultural care. Discussion To address intercultural care for refugees from Ukraine, macro\u2010 and microlevel factors should be considered. Healthcare facilities need certified interpreters or adequate language\u2010access technology for nurses. Nursing programs might evaluate content on trauma\u2010informed care and cultural competency to meet the needs of war\u2010affected refugees. Leaders from Ukrainian refugee communities could partner with nurses to deliver culturally relevant information to increase vaccine uptake. Implications Nurses should advocate for inclusion of the WHO competency standards of care for refugees in healthcare policies with emphasis on communication and evidence\u2010informed practice.

Unfortunately, attempts to incorporate Indigenous knowledge into Western approaches, often without the full leadership, consent, and participation of the peoples holding those knowledges, can cause harm and can constitute extractive activities. However, there remains considerable potential in collaborations bringing together multiple perspectives and knowledges. We introduce the M\u0313\u1e47\u00faxv\u0294it model, which centers Indigenous governance systems as the natural starting point for respectful, cross\u2010knowledge system collaborations.

In collaborations following this model, Indigenous communities and governments lead the overall direction, Indigenous knowledge systems are foundational, local protocols are followed, benefits flow at least as much to communities as to collaborators, and collaborations are authentic and transparent.

Collaborations following the model uphold Indigenous and local sovereignty while avoiding superficial or tokenistic approaches.

Based on the theory of T. Kuhn, the concept of \"paradigm\" is described, which, according to the scientist's ideas, forms the worldview of researchers in a certain subject area and serves as the basis for choosing approaches and methods of scientific research in any scientific discipline. The methodological foundations of the study of farming systems are shown, and the dependence of agronomic research on logical positivism and instrumentalism with a reductionist approach is emphasized. The application of systematic thinking in the development of research programs in the field of farming, analysis and interpretation of the results of field experiments, including the use of artificial intelligence is substantiated. The need to develop research on the geography of farming systems and their scaling in space and time through the formation of archetypes based on the results of field experiments of scientific and educational institutions obtained on \"small plots\" is emphasized. In order to develop approaches to scaling the archetypes of farming systems, it is proposed to use the concept of \"geons\" as one of the promising trends in geoinformatics, as well as remote sensing materials. Increasing biodiversity, in particular diversification, may be one of the main approaches to overcome the negative impacts of chemical-technogenic intensification on nature. Strategies for diversifying cropping systems are implemented through crop rotations, associated plant species (cover crops, trap crops, repellent crops, buffer crops), mixture of varieties and crops, agroforestry and formation of agro-landscape heterogeneity.

To tackle the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, an acceleration of vaccine development across different technology platforms resulted in the emergency use authorization of multiple vaccines in less than a year. Despite this record speed, many limitations surfaced including unequal access to products and technologies, regulatory hurdles, restrictions on the flow of intellectual property needed to develop and manufacture vaccines, clinical trials challenges, development of vaccines that did not curtail or prevent transmission, unsustainable strategies for dealing with variants, and the distorted allocation of funding to favour dominant companies in affluent countries. Key to future epidemic and pandemic responses will be sustainable, global-public-health-driven vaccine development and manufacturing based on equitable access to platform technologies, decentralised and localised innovation, and multiple developers and manufacturers, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). There is talk of flexible, modular pandemic preparedness, of technology access pools based on non-exclusive global licensing agreements in exchange for fair compensation, of WHO-supported vaccine technology transfer hubs and spokes, and of the creation of vaccine prototypes ready for phase I/II trials, etc. However, all these concepts face extraordinary challenges shaped by current commercial incentives, the unwillingness of pharmaceutical companies and governments to share intellectual property and know-how, the precariousness of building capacity based solely on COVID-19 vaccines, the focus on large-scale manufacturing capacity rather than small-scale rapid-response innovation to stop outbreaks when and where they occur, and the inability of many resource-limited countries to afford next-generation vaccines for their national vaccine programmes. Once the current high subsidies are gone and interest has waned, sustaining vaccine innovation and manufacturing capability in interpandemic periods will require equitable access to vaccine innovation and manufacturing capabilities in all regions of the world based on many vaccines, not just \u201cpandemic vaccines\u201d. Public and philanthropic investments will need to leverage enforceable commitments to share vaccines and critical technology so that countries everywhere can establish and scale up vaccine development and manufacturing capability. This will only happen if we question all prior assumptions and learn the lessons offered by the current pandemic.

This underscores the critical need for next-generation broad-spectrum pan-Coronavirus vaccines (pan-CoV vaccine) to break this cycle and end the pandemic.

In this context, the Internet of Things (IoT) is crucial in transforming existing urban areas into Smart Cities. However, IoT architectures mainly focus on machine-to-machine interactions, leaving human involvement aside. The Internet of Everything (IoE) includes human-to-human and human\u2013machine collaboration, but the specifics of these interactions are still under-explored. As urban populations grow and IoT integrates into city infrastructure, efficient, collaborative architectures become crucial. In this work, we use the Rapid Review methodology to analyze collaboration in four prevalent computing architectures in the IoE paradigm, namely Edge Computing, Cloud Computing, Blockchain/Web Services, and Fog Computing. To analyze the collaboration, we use the 3C collaboration model, comprising communication, cooperation, and coordination. Our findings highlight the importance of Edge and Cloud Computing for enhancing collaborative coordination, focusing on efficiency and network optimization. Edge Computing supports real-time, low-latency processing at data sources, while Cloud Computing offers scalable resources for diverse workloads, optimizing coordination and productivity. Effective resource allocation and network configuration in these architectures are essential for cohesive IoT ecosystems. Therefore, this work offers a comparative analysis of four computing architectures, clarifying their capabilities and limitations. Smart Cities are a major beneficiary of these insights.

The program offered an 18-month job alongside cognitive behavioral therapy and other social support. Both algorithmic and human referral methods identified men with strikingly high scope for gun violence reduction: for every 100 people in the control group, there were 11 shooting and homicide victimizations during the 20-month outcome period. Fifty-five percent of the treatment group started programming, comparable to take-up rates in programs for people facing far lower mortality risk. After 20 months, there is no statistically significant change in an index combining three measures of serious violence, the study's primary outcome. Yet there are signs that this program model has promise. One of the three measures, shooting and homicide arrests, declines 65 percent (p=0.13 after multiple testing adjustment). Because shootings are so costly, READI generates estimated social savings between $182,000 and $916,000 per participant (p=0.03), implying a benefit-cost ratio between 4:1 and 18:1. Moreover, participants referred by outreach workers-a pre-specified subgroup-show enormous declines in both arrests and victimizations for shootings and homicides (79 and 43 percent, respectively) that remain statistically significant even after multiple testing adjustments.

Average WTP for a reduction of 20% in the state rate of gun violence was $744 per household (IQR:$668-$928), implying a national total of $97.6 billion.

This study argues that affective partisan political polarization fosters dehumanization of opposing partisans, lends a moralistic and zero-sum nature to political life, and facilitates group mobilization. These all produce an environment in which political violence is both more socially acceptable and more frequent. The study tests this assertion using two sets of empirical tests: an original survey of 1,899\u2009US residents and a cross-national time-series analysis of eighty-three democracies. It finds that in the United States, Democrats who express aversion toward Republicans are 8% more likely to express support for the use of political violence, whereas Republicans who express aversion toward Democrats are 18% more likely to endorse political violence.

This is particularly evident in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, a significant case study for this research. Transgression, breaking or exceeding societal norms, can manifest through civil disobedience or defiant behavior to challenge oppressive systems. Violence, conversely, refers to the deliberate use of physical force or authority to cause harm or destruction. The escalation from transgression to violence occurs when individuals or groups resort to aggression to restore order or assert power. This shift is particularly evident in protests or riots triggered by social injustices or political oppression. Such events can intensify due to radical democratic possibilities and the influence of technology. Digital platforms, with their crucial role in shaping public opinion, mobilizing individuals, and strengthening collective fears about social change, significantly contribute to the escalation of conflict. They also facilitate the production of panic and misinformation, complicating the landscape of public discourse and protest. In the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, deep-rooted historical and political complexities mark the intersection of transgression and violence. Territorial disputes and competing national narratives drive both Israeli and Palestinian actions. Resistance to the Israeli occupation often involves transgressive acts such as protests or violent resistance, while Israeli security measures, perceived as transgressions by Palestinians, exacerbate tensions and contribute to ongoing violence.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-10-31", "synthetic_support_claim": "Digital platforms significantly contribute to the escalation of conflict by shaping public opinion and mobilizing individuals.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is solely a result of digital platforms fueling misinformation and public panic."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "9ad647a2520ced1385f273d8066c79699151f345", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9ad647a2520ced1385f273d8066c79699151f345", "title": "Trends in Political Science Research: Affective Polarization", "abstract": "This article provides a systematic review of the literature on affective polarization, emphasizing its emotional, identity-based, and systemic dimensions across diverse political contexts.

In this paper, we first introduce different models of regulatory capture from the social science literature. We then present results from interviews with 17 AI policy experts on what policy outcomes could compose regulatory capture in US AI policy, which AI industry actors are influencing the policy process, and whether and how AI industry actors attempt to achieve outcomes of regulatory capture. Experts were primarily concerned with capture leading to a lack of AI regulation, weak regulation, or regulation that over-emphasizes certain policy goals over others. Experts most commonly identified agenda-setting (15 of 17 interviews), advocacy (13), academic capture (10), information management (9), cultural capture through status (7), and media capture (7) as channels for industry influence. To mitigate these particular forms of industry influence, we recommend systemic changes in developing technical expertise in government and civil society, independent funding streams for the AI ecosystem, increased transparency and ethics requirements, greater civil society access to policy, and various procedural safeguards.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-10-16", "synthetic_support_claim": "Capture of AI policy by AI developers and deployers could hinder regulatory goals like safety and fairness.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "AI regulation is unnecessary because the industry can self-regulate effectively without compromising public welfare."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "534dc1d63a8535d52106ad7a1046069e4b16bab9", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/534dc1d63a8535d52106ad7a1046069e4b16bab9", "title": "Pr\u00e1vna regul\u00e1cia umelej inteligencie (perspekt\u00edvy a v\u00fdzvy).", "abstract": "Law Regulation of Artificial Intelligence (Perspectives and Challenges).

The data analysis used was the ordered logit/probit regression analysis with a sample of 20,701 respondents from 16 countries. To measure FWB, this study uses both objective and subjective FWB.\nFindings \u2014 The results show the average FWB in the medium category, reflecting a moderate level where individuals neither face substantial financial difficulties nor achieve full financial satisfaction. The feeling of happiness is an important factor for a person to achieve high FWB even though they have a relatively low income or are relatively satisfied with their financial situation. Religiosity and education level have a positive effect on FWB while financial capability in success (hard work) has a negative effect, but saving has a positive effect on FWB.\nOriginality/Value \u2014 This paper is the first to highlight the determinants of FWB in Muslim-majority countries with insights from World Values Survey data. The study contributes to the literature on FWB, specifically in the context of Muslim-majority countries.\nResearch Limitations/Implications \u2014 A limitation of this study relates to the data availability and its use of some independent variables based on World Values Survey data.

Yet some distinctly different modalities of conjunctural analysis are at play in this burgeoning work. The first two sections of this essay offer close readings of the conjunctural analyses of Gramsci and Stuart Hall; their respective relationships to the work of Louis Althusser; and the political work that conjunctural analysis was doing for each of them in relation to fascism and Thatcherism.

Our study theorizes and empirically explores the reverse perspective on this relationship: focusing on the role of the opposition, we submit that backsliding may crystallize an affective dislike among opposition supporters towards the governing party and its supporters that stems from a regime divide over democracy itself. To probe the plausibility of this argument, we leverage original survey data collected in Hungary, where democratic backsliding under the Fidesz government has resulted in an extensive remodelling of the political system since 2010. Our results point to a government\u2013opposition divide in partisan affect and show how liberal democratic attitudes, especially among opposition party supporters, play into this dynamic. We suggest that where backsliding persists over a longer period, this process can shift even multi\u2010party systems towards increasing bipolarity along what we term a \u2018democratic divide\u2019. Ultimately, our study proposes a novel lens on the dynamics of democratic backsliding by suggesting that affective polarization may play a positive role in backsliding contexts by uniting the opposition around the defence of democracy.

Methods This study analyzed data from 283 Saudi individuals aged \u226565 admitted to social residential care homes in 2021. Variables included age, sex, education level, marital status, region, and reasons for service use. Statistical analyses comprised descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, independent t-tests, and multivariable logistic regression. Results The Makkah region had the highest number of senior residential care home users (56.8%; p\u202f<\u202f0.0001). Most participants were men (67.8%), while women constituted 32.2%. The mean age was 78.9\u202fyears (SD\u202f=\u202f10.6), with women being significantly older than men (p\u202f=\u202f0.014). Illiteracy was prevalent (73.5%), particularly among women (82.4% vs. 69.3% for men; p\u202f=\u202f0.006). Most participants were divorced (68.2%), with higher rates among men (84.9% vs. 33% for women; p\u202f<\u202f0.0001). The primary reasons for utilizing residential care home services were old age and functional dependency (88.5% of men and 83.4% of women).

These should be developed in partnership with urban planning entities, seeking to consolidate these approaches in policies that support social resilience and institutional capacity.

There has been a deliberate \"weaponization\" of messaging through the use of social networks, including by politically oriented entities, both state-sponsored and privately run. The article identifies a use of AI/ML characterization of generalized \"mal-info,\" a broad term which includes deliberate malicious narratives similar to hate speech, which adversely impacts society. A key point of the discussion is that this mal-info will dramatically increase in volume, and it will become essential for sharable quantifying tools to provide support for human expert intervention. Despite attempts to introduce moderation on major platforms like Facebook and X/Twitter, there are now established alternative social networks that offer completely unmoderated spaces. The paper presents an introduction to these platforms and a case study showing a qualitative and semi-quantitative analysis of representative examples of mal-info posts. The action examines several inflammatory terms using text analysis and, importantly, discusses the use of generative algorithms by one political agent in particular, providing some examples of the potential risks to society. This latter is of grave concern, and monitoring tools must be established. This paper presents a preliminary step to selecting relevant sources and setting a foundation for characterizing the mal-info, which must be addressed to ensure societal well-being.

Whilst approaches to risk governance have been evolving for more than a decade, recent disasters have shown that conventional risk management solutions need to be complemented with a multidimensional risk approach to govern complex risks and prevent major, often simultaneous, crises with cascading and knock-on effects on multiple, interrelated systems at scale. The paper explores which risk governance innovations will be essential to provide the enabling environment for sustainable development that is resilient to interrelated shocks and risks.Design/methodology/approachThis interdisciplinary literature review-based thought piece highlights how systemic risk is socially constructed and identifies guiding principles for systemic risk governance that could be actionable by and provide entry points for local and national governments, civil society and the private sector. particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), in a way that is relevant to the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This considers preparedness, response and resilience, but more importantly prospective and corrective risk control and reduction strategies and mechanisms. Only when systemic risk is framed in a way that is relevant to the political agendas of countries will it be possible to begin a dialogue for its governance.FindingsThe paper identifies opportunities at the global, national and local levels, which together draw up a viable framework for systemic risk governance that (1) embraces the governance of sustainability and resilience through a strengthened holistic governance framework for social, economic, territorial and environmental development; (2) improves managing conventional risk to ultimately manage systemic risks; (3) fosters the understanding of vulnerability and exposure to gain insight into systemic risk; (4) places a greater focus on prospective risk management; (5) manages systemic risk in local infrastructure systems, supply chains and ecosystems; (6) shifts the focus from protecting privatized gains to managing socialized risk.Originality/valueThe choices and actions that societies take on the path of their development are contributing intentionally or unintentionally to the construction of systemic risks, which result in knock-on effects among interconnected social, environmental, political and economic systems. These risks are manifesting in major crises with cascading effects and a real potential to undermine the achievement of the SDGs, as COVID-19 is a stark reminder of.

The epidemic then spread to many other Westernized nations. Many interventions have been carried out with the goal of lowering the prevalence of obesity. These have mostly taken the form of various types of health promotion (i.e., providing people with education, advice, and encouragement). These actions have achieved, at most, only limited success. A strategy with a better chance of success starts with the recognition that the fundamental cause of obesity is that we live in an obesogenic environment. It is therefore necessary to change the environment so that it fosters a generally healthy lifestyle, thereby leading to enhanced health for the population, including improved weight control. A major goal is to increase the intake of healthy foods (especially fruit, vegetables, and whole grains), while decreasing intake of unhealthy foods (especially ultra-processed foods such as sugar). This will require major changes of many government policies. Some of the required policies are as follows. Schools should implement policies that create a healthy environment for children. For example, they should adopt a policy that only foods of high nutritional quality are sold in vending machines or given to students within school meals. Policies need to go well beyond the school setting; a broad strategy is needed that creates a healthy environment for children. Another important policy is the manipulation of food prices in order to shift the diet toward healthy foods. This requires using subsidies to lower the price of healthy foods, while adding a tax to less healthy foods to increase the price. This policy has been implemented in many cities and countries in the form of a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs). The advertising of unhealthy foods (including fast-food restaurants) should be banned, especially where children and adolescents are the major target. Such a ban could be extended to a complete ban on all advertising for unhealthy foods, including that directed at adults.

Statistical analyses were used to identify associations between dietary beliefs and body mass index. Results: In total, 29.5% of participants were overweight or obese. Two groups of beliefs were identified: healthier beliefs and less healthy beliefs. Children with less healthy dietary beliefs had a significantly higher BMI (22.16 kg/m2) compared to those with healthier beliefs (17.2 kg/m2). False nutritional beliefs, influenced by advertising and the family environment, contribute to overweight and obesity. Discussion: Dietary beliefs play a crucial role in determining eating habits and, therefore, the health of children. Nutrition education and public policies that promote healthy eating habits are essential to prevent childhood obesity. It is important to involve the family, the school, and the media in these efforts. Conclusions: Despite efforts, many children continue to hold erroneous nutritional beliefs that contribute to the rise in overweight and obesity. This study highlights the importance of addressing dietary beliefs and promoting appropriate nutrition education to prevent childhood obesity. It is recommended to implement educational strategies and public policies that regulate the advertising of unhealthy foods and promote healthy eating habits.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-01-01", "synthetic_support_claim": "False nutritional beliefs, influenced by advertising and family environment, contribute to overweight and obesity in children.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Genetics play a more significant role than dietary beliefs in childhood obesity development and prevalence."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "134df372680111741599e5a68ea462b402b74b00", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/134df372680111741599e5a68ea462b402b74b00", "title": "Global insect decline is the result of wilful political failure: A battle plan for entomology", "abstract": "Abstract The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment assessed ecosystem change, human wellbeing and scientific evidence for sustainable use of biological systems. Despite intergovernmental acknowledgement of the problem, global ecological decline has continued, including declines in insect biodiversity, which has received much media attention in recent years. Several roadmaps to averting biological declines have failed due to various economic and political factors, and so biodiversity loss continues, driven by several interacting human pressures. Humans are innately linked with nature but tend to take it for granted. The benefits we gain from the insect world are broad, yet aversion or phobias of invertebrates are common, and stand firmly in the path of their successful conservation. Providing an integrated synthesis for policy teams, conservation NGOs, academic researchers and those interested in public engagement, this article considers: (1) The lack of progress to preserve and protect insects. (2) Examples relating to insect decline and contributions insects make to people worldwide, and consequently what we stand to lose. (3) How to engage the public, governmental organizations and researchers through \u201cinsect contributions to people\u201d to better address insect declines.

Yet, a high proportion of insect species remain undescribed and limited data on their population dynamics hamper insect conservation efforts. This is particularly critical in tropical biodiversity hotspots such as Southeast Asia. To identify knowledge and capacity gaps in Southeast Asian insect conservation, we performed a quantitative review of insect occurrence records, studies for the region and global '#conservation' posts from Twitter. We found that occurrence records increased over time, and were dominated by butterflies. Overall, studies were largely focused on pest and vector groups, and insect conservation and ecology studies were lacking in many countries. Despite an increase in local authorships and funding sources over time, the majority of these were still located outside of Southeast Asia. In '#conservation' posts, insects were highly under-represented and insect-related content was biased towards popular groups such as bees and butterflies.

Particularly in the workplace, AI is depicted as an unstoppable force that shapes an entirely novel labour process. Consequently, efforts to regulate its introduction and deployment are dismissed as futile or even regressive. This paper argues for a different approach. Firstly, it proposes engaging with AI within the framework of Fordism-Taylorism, reflecting capital's long-standing aspirations for labour intensification, opacity of decision making and separation between conception and execution. Secondly, drawing on recent workers' struggles, with a particular focus on the Efood platform in Greece, the paper illustrates how labour resistance can influence the deployment and regulation of AI. The case study of Efood highlights the collective actions taken by workers against AI-powered algorithmic management, demonstrating the potential for labour to contest and reshape the introduction of new technologies.

The absence of recognition as formal employees leaves these workers in precarious conditions, devoid of social security, minimum wage guarantees, and collective bargaining rights. This policy paper reviews existing regulations, evaluates international approaches, and identifies the benefits and challenges of unregulated gig work in Indonesia.

It is proposed to start an indicator of the effectiveness of the head of state and an internal truth index of the head of state, as well as measures for moral stimulation of heads of state. As a result of the study, two root causes of threats to the existence of humanity were additionally identified, which directly affect the formation of dictatorial regimes. 1) The emergence on the basis of modern information technologies of a powerful system of manipulative technologies, the use of which leads to the power of future dictators. 2) Belated opposition of the democratic world to the formation of dictatorships. This is expressed in condescension to the initial illegal actions of future dictators, uncontrolled cooperation in the economic, political and humanitarian spheres.

The historical disputes around measles, mumps, rubella, and influenza highlight the recurring pattern in which public doubt is fueled by false information and personal stories. A 2024 multinational study in the journal Vaccine presented preexisting safety indicators for myocarditis, pericarditis, Guillain \u2013 Barr\u00e9 syndrome, and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. The study had a notably large sample size and contributed to the ongoing discussion of vaccine safety. Examining this research clarifies the subtle distinctions between demonstrating causality and simple association, emphasizing the importance of thorough scientific investigation and open communication. The following recommendations should be prioritized to tackle vaccine hesitancy and ensure that politicians, healthcare practitioners, and public health officials make informed decisions.

However, its uptake rate in China is 2.24%, and HPV vaccine hesitancy is widespread. This study aimed to identify whether cultural perceptions of sexuality in China influence HPV vaccine hesitancy and explore the correlation between sexual attitudes, sexual morality, and HPV hesitancy in Chinese. Methods Between January and April 2024, we adopted a qualitative approach and conducted in-depth, one-on-one, semi-structured interviews with 15 young female Chinese university students of sexual maturity. Results Although all college students exhibited vaccine hesitancy, their perceptions of vaccines and reasons for hesitation varied. This study classified hesitancy into three types: individuals hesitant owing to cultural conservatism and stigmatization, individuals with positive intentions but delayed vaccination, and overconfident individuals who disregarded vaccines. The reasons for vaccine hesitancy are linked to China\u2019s conservative culture of sexuality, and Chinese sexual attitudes and morality have complex mechanisms that influence vaccination. Social taboos on sexual topics lead to inadequate sources of information regarding the HPV vaccine. Sexual morality is internalized into an individual\u2019s subconscious, influencing the cognition of the vaccine. Negative associations and stigmatization of the vaccine further discourage vaccination. Discussion Vaccine hesitancy is not solely a medical or political-economic issue but also a deep-seated cultural issue. Culture significantly affects individual health behaviors, and ignoring socio-cultural factors can exacerbate public health problems.

The solution to this challenge is to create a framework for public engagement, particularly during the legislative process.

Over the past 16\u00a0years, advances in stem cell research have transitioned from generating stem cells to utilising these cells in building sophisticated organ models and bioengineered tissues. This transition represents a significant move from the 'what' of cell creation to the 'how' of constructing and interpreting three-dimensional human models. Through ethnographic research (including observations and interviews) in Europe and North America, we explore how organoids are constructed and the underlying logic driving their development.

We assessed whether the known association between ACE and depression was modified (or differed) by adult transgender identity and by assigned sex at birth, which we used as a proxy for adults' biological (e.g., hormonal changes) and social (e.g., sexism) experiences in childhood. Methods Data from a representative sample of 519 transgender and 127,214 cisgender US adults was retrieved from the 2019 and 2020 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System surveys. The sample was stratified by assigned sex at birth. Adjusted, sample-weighted Poisson regressions and relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI) were used to assess whether transgender identity modified the association between ACE and depression within strata of assigned sex at birth. Results We found 42.4% of transgender compared to 24.9% of cisgender adults experienced 3+ ACE. The association between ACE and depression was stronger for transgender compared to cisgender adults, regardless of assigned sex at birth. However, transgender adults assigned female at birth with 1\u20132 ACE had a combined risk of depression that was higher than would be expected from the sum of the two risks alone (RERI test of interaction for transgender with 1\u20132 ACE vs. cisgender with zero ACE: 1.91 [95% confidence interval 0.47\u20133.36]; p\u2009=\u20090.009). The tests of interaction were not statistically significant (p\u2009>\u20090.05) for those assigned male at birth. Discussion Transgender adults may benefit more from depression interventions informed by and addressing childhood trauma than their cisgender counterparts, particularly for transgender adults who were assigned female at birth. Our findings suggest a need for greater and improved data collection of gender, experiences associated with assigned sex at birth, and ACE as these relate to the transgender community.

There is a debate in the literature about why people spread misinformation and what should be done about it. According to the purely cognitive account, people largely spread misinformation because they are lazy, not biased. According to a motivational account, people are also motivated to believe and spread misinformation for ideological and partisan reasons. To better understand the psychological and neurocognitive processes that underlie misinformation sharing among the far-right, we conducted a cross-cultural experiment with conservatives and far-right partisans in the Unites States and Spain (N = 1,609) and a neuroimaging study with far-right partisans in Spain (N = 36). Far-right partisans in Spain and U.S. Republicans who highly identify with Trump were more likely to share misinformation than center-right voters and other Republicans, especially when the misinformation was related to sacred values (e.g., immigration). Sacred values predicted misinformation sharing above and beyond familiarity, attitude strength, and salience of the issue. Moreover, far-right partisans were unresponsive to fact-checking and accuracy nudges. At a neural level, this group showed increased activity in brain regions implicated in mentalizing and norm compliance in response to posts with sacred values. These results suggest that the two components of political devotion-identity fusion and sacred values-play a key role in misinformation sharing, highlighting the identity-affirming dimension of misinformation sharing.

While extensive research has been conducted on misinformation in democratic systems, where press freedom and digitalization foster a mix of reliable and misleading information, this investigation targets the unique challenges and media consumption patterns in CARs. Utilizing a nationally representative survey after the 2023 elections, we examine the association between media consumption (traditional and online) and susceptibility to misinformation among government and opposition voters. Our findings reveal that partisan news consumption significantly influences belief in misinformation, with individuals tending to believe claims aligning with their political affiliations while rejecting opposing claims. Moreover, television remains a dominant source of information in Turkey, unlike social media, which shows a limited impact on misinformation beliefs but possesses a conditional corrective potential for certain electorate segments.

Federal and state policies increasingly require plans to assess and incorporate EJ principles. The current lack of accessible data and plan evaluation on EJ has been a barrier to policy setting and benchmarking. We created a framework for analyzing content across a large corpus of plans by using quantitative text analysis on 461 California city general plans, also known as comprehensive plans. To verify results and identify specific policies, we conducted content analysis on a subset of seven plans. Demonstrating the broad applicability of EJ principles in planning, policies spanned all required elements of general plans: housing, circulation, land use, health, safety, open space, air quality, and noise. We found that the most headway in EJ planning has been made in cities with a majority population of color and well before the 2018 California state mandate to address EJ. Policies were primarily focused on preventing adverse exposures as opposed to correcting for legacies of inequality. Further, although all policies address vulnerable populations and places, very few specifically address race or racism. Thus, EJ has been largely operationalized as health equity. Takeaway for practice We identified 628 EJ policies focused on vulnerable populations across the seven city plans included in content analysis. The smorgasbord of policy approaches provides fodder for cities across the United States to incorporate an EJ approach to planning. Gaps in focus areas reveal room for policy innovation (e.g., emphasis on language justice, formerly incarcerated individuals, and noise ordinance policing).

The empirical analysis shows that positive and negative identification with populist parties is driven by different understandings of democracy: While individuals who are less inclined to liberal democracy but more to direct democracy and authoritarian forms of rule are more likely to sympathise with populist parties, the opposite understanding of democracy predicts opposition to both left-wing and right-wing populists.

And, given their radical but diverse challenges of democracies and the liberal international order (LIO), which variety of populism gains under which conditions? Rather than emphasizing populists as a cause of the crises of liberal order, this book argues that the historical empowerment of liberal international institutions itself gradually undermined democratic legitimacy perceptions among citizens and thereby boosted varieties of populism. Moving beyond theoretical accounts and bridging comparative politics and international relations, it presents comparative evidence from survey data, party manifestos, societal data, and international institutional power across up to thirty-seven democracies between 1980 and 2019, using both statistical analyses and a comparative case study of eight states in the EU to support its claims. Accounting for existing economic, cultural, domestic political, and supply-side explanations, the book shows that normative political evaluations relating to international institutions contributed to gains for populist challengers across the spectrum in recent decades. But while evidence shows that the populist radical left\u2019s (PRL) inclusionary populism does not challenge the LIO as an authoritarian and nationalist threat in contrast to the populist radical right (PRR), greater demand for the PRR\u2019s distinctive ideology and more competition by (non-)populist parties explain why the PRL gained less in practice from processes of democratic legitimacy depletion in the LIO.

The crisis politics that was deployed to deal with such tensions has often constrained policy responses in scope and effectiveness.

Using a narrative synthesis approach to published systematic reviews, we synthesized the evidence from both modelling and observational studies on the effects of border control measures on domestic transmission of the virus. We find that symptomatic screening measures were not particularly effective, but that diagnostic-based screening methods were more effective at identifying infected travellers. Targeted travel restrictions levied against travellers from Wuhan were likely temporarily effective but insufficient to stop the exportation of the virus to the rest of the world. Quarantine of inbound travellers was also likely effective at reducing transmission, but only with relatively long quarantine periods, and came with important economic and social effects. There is little evidence that most travel restrictions, including border closure and those implemented to stop the introduction of new variants of concern, were particularly effective. Border control measures played an important role in former elimination locations but only when coupled with strong domestic public health measures.

Methods This retrospective cohort study analyzed data from 116 004 air passengers who entered Thailand through Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok from April 2020 to September 2020. The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, risk characteristics, and accuracy indices of symptom-based screening were calculated. Results The overall incidence of SARS-CoV-2 was 0.5%, or 540 infections per 100 000 air passengers. Identified risk factors included sex, nationality, continent of departure, on-arrival screening results, and month of travel. Positive screening results indicated a higher risk and positive likelihood ratio for SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the on-arrival screening criteria demonstrated low sensitivity and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Conclusions The current study confirms previous findings that the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection during air travel is low. However, this might result from strict pre-departure screening and the SARS-CoV-2 test requirement for arriving passengers.

Evidence from previous outbreaks suggested travel restrictions were largely unnecessary and counterproductive to timely reporting. This led to initial WHO recommendations against the use of travel restrictions. Substantial evidence of the role of human travel in spreading SARS-CoV-2 worldwide throughout the evolving pandemic supported new thinking about the use of different types of travel measures (ie, screening, restrictions, quarantine, immunity documentation) to limit the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into jurisdictions with low incidence and onward transmission. However, governments failed to work together, undermining public health goals. In addition, profound secondary impacts were caused by uncoordinated, frequently changing and poorly evidenced use of travel measures. Alongside the need to better understand what, when and how travel measures should be used during public health emergencies of international concern, improved global governance is required. Recently adopted revisions to the International Health Regulations (IHR), notably Article 43, failed to change current rules and commitments. Travel measures are also not being addressed in the negotiation of a pandemic agreement. Evolving evidence from COVID-19 supports a risk-based approach but global consensus on a standardised methodology remains needed. Setting aside further IHR revision, this methodology and guidelines could be advanced through a WHO technical working group.

We find strong support for the trust paradox, particularly in the area of AI-enabled police surveillance, where the levels of support for its use are both higher than other domains but also significantly exceed trust. We unpack these findings to show that several underlying beliefs help account for public attitudes of support, including the fear of missing out, optimism that future versions of the technology will be more trustworthy, a belief that the benefits of AI-enabled technologies outweigh the risks, and calculation that AI-enabled technologies yield efficiency gains.

The energy being generated around this transformative moment is widening circles of participation in the discourse on what transformation should look like in the field. The importance of decoloniality cannot be overstated in driving the transformative agenda.

This review presents a comprehensive assessment of the medication access and distribution landscape in Nigeria, highlighting both the existing hurdles and potential avenues for improvement. In Nigeria, inadequate infrastructure, including poor road networks and limited storage facilities, significantly impedes the efficient distribution of medications across the country. Moreover, the prevalence of counterfeit drugs further exacerbates the issue, posing grave risks to public health and undermining trust in the healthcare system. These challenges disproportionately affect rural and underserved communities, exacerbating health disparities. However, amidst these obstacles lie several opportunities for enhancement. The advent of digital technologies offers promising solutions for improving medication distribution efficiency and combating counterfeit drugs. Mobile health applications and blockchain technology can enhance supply chain transparency, ensuring the authenticity and quality of medications from manufacturer to end-user. Furthermore, strengthening regulatory frameworks and collaboration between government agencies, pharmaceutical companies, and healthcare providers is imperative to address systemic issues and bolster medication access nationwide.

Design and setting This study used three recent rounds of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS), a cross-sectional survey in India, conducted in 2005\u20132006, 2015\u20132016 and 2019\u20132021. Bivariate analysis and multinomial logistic regression were used to estimate the utilisation of key MCH indicators from subsidised and unsubsidised health sectors. Market sustainability of key MCH indicators was assessed by level of MCH services and subsidisation. Participants 36 850, 190\u2009898 and 176\u2009843 ever-married women aged 15\u201349 years, 4440, 22\u2009500 and 15\u2009334 children under 5 years of age with diarrhoea before the survey, and 2552, 6960 and 6117 children with symptoms of acute respiratory infections (ARI) in NFHS 2005\u20132006, 2015\u20132016 and 2019\u20132021, respectively. Outcome measures The study used three maternal healthcare indicators: women had four or more antenatal care (ANC) visits, had institutional delivery, and received postnatal care (PNC); and two child healthcare indicators: care seeking for ARI and diarrhoea. Results In India, utilisation of maternal healthcare services increased over the last 15 years: four or more ANC visits increased from 37% to 58% and PNC of mothers increased from 33% to 78% between 2005\u20132006 and 2019\u20132021. The results of the multivariate analysis showed that utilisation of ANC (67% from public vs 18% from private health facilities), institutional delivery (64% from public vs 25% from private health facilities) and PNC (73% from public vs 27% from private health facilities) was significantly higher (p<0.001) in public than in private health facilities. Care seeking for ARI and diarrhoea among children was significantly higher (p<0.001) in private than in public health facilities; care for ARI was 68% in private health facilities compared with 32% in public health facilities.

However, as highly resourced and influential institutions, they have an inherently transformative potential, should their resources and activities be redirected towards progressive social and ecological ends, which challenge rather than support the unsustainable status quo. This means that, as workers within these institutions, academics and researchers are faced with a choice: to be agents of this reproduction or to be advocates and activists for change. We argue for the latter. In doing so, we seek to build on the analysis and demands of emergent movements such as Fossil Free Research, Faculty for a Future and Scientist Rebellion in making the case for universities to show leadership on listening to the very science they produce on the planetary emergency, and act accordingly. Employing a green political economy critical analysis, the article suggests that, if they are to contribute to societal transformation, universities themselves must undergo transformations that explicitly and systematically reorient academic practices around social and ecological protection and priorities. Building on these findings, it lays out a series of normative and practical arguments for a broad programme of democratisation around three pillars of academic practise: (1) Research, (2) Education and (3) Outreach and engagement. However, any such processes will of course be difficult, especially given the wider neoliberal political and political economy context within which universities operate, as well as a conservative institutional culture which disincentivises dissent from \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d.

This article proposes that a lack of capacity to express and share emotions about the CEC in universities is at the heart of their relative climate silence and inertia. We build a theoretical and experimental justification for the importance of climate emotions in HE, drawing on our collective experience of the Climate Lab project (2021\u20132023), a series of in-person and online workshops that brought together scientists, engineers, and artists. We analyse the roles of grief, vulnerability, and creativity in the conversations that occurred, and explore these exchanges as potential pathways out of socially organised climate denial in neoliberal institutions. By drawing on the emerging field of \u201cemotional methodologies,\u201d we make a case for the importance of emotionally reflexive practices for overcoming an institutionalised disconnect between feeling and knowing, especially in Western-disciplinary contexts. We suggest that if staff and students are afforded opportunities to connect with their emotions about the CEC, then institutional transformation is (a) more likely to happen and be meaningfully sustained and (b) less likely to fall into the same problematic patterns of knowledge and action that perpetuate these crises.

I find that the effect of populism on support for political violence is mediated through fear of social/demographic change and preference for illiberal rule but not through economic grievances or distrust of political institutions.

The research was motivated by the importance of creating sustainable government governance, especially in realizing reduced poverty rates in Tasikmalaya City. One of the most appropriate approaches was service integration policy intervention. The research used a quantitative approach with survey research through data collection in questionnaires to 330 respondents using random sampling clusters spread throughout the sub-districts of Tasikmalaya City. The independent variables used were e-government policy and data interoperability. Apart from that, the dependent variable was poverty reduction. The data interoperability and e-government influenced poverty alleviation by 54.07%. On the other hand, some evidence suggested a connection between data interoperability and poverty reduction to a certain extent. This emphasized the importance of integration between agencies, which could be accessed through a collection of inter-agency activity programs, especially in the distribution of poverty assistance programs. Therefore, the Tasikmalaya City Government needed to immediately implement a data interoperability policy as a valuable effort to design economic empowerment programs and create an integrated public service online portal that provided information ranging from social assistance to workforce training programs.

We focus on Mexico, which experienced multiple waves of assassinations of local journalists after the federal government declared a War on Drugs against the country\u2019s main cartels and deployed the military to the country\u2019s most conflictive regions. We argue that violence against journalists is tied to the outbreak of criminal wars\u2014the multiple localized turf wars and power struggles unleashed by the federal military intervention. Subnational politicians and their security forces and drug lords are at the center of these conflicts because they jointly enable local operations of the transnational drug-trafficking industry. To defend their interests, they have individual and shared incentives to prevent city- and town-level journalists from (or punish them for) publishing fine-grained information that may compromise their criminal and political survival and their quest for local control. We compiled the most comprehensive dataset available on lethal attacks on journalists from 1994 to 2019 to test our claims. Using a difference-in-differences design, we show that violence against local journalists substantially increased in militarized regions, where the military decapitated the cartels and fragmented the criminal underworld, triggering violent competition for criminal governance\u2014de facto rule over territories, people, and illicit economies. Evidence from original focus groups and interviews with at-risk reporters suggests that governors, mayors, and their police forces possibly joined cartels in murdering journalists to mitigate the risks of unwanted information and to minimize the costs of criminal governance by silencing the press and society.

Precarious employment was imputed using a job exposure matrix capturing temporary employment, low wages, irregular hours, involuntary part-time employment and a multidimensional indicator of 'low', 'medium', 'high' and 'very high' overall exposure to precarious employment. We used negative binomial regression models to quantify associations between precarious employment and accepted compensation claims for COVID-19.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe observed a monotonic association between precarious employment and work-related COVID-19 claims. Workers with 'very high' exposure to precarious employment presented a nearly fivefold claim risk in models controlling for age, sex and pandemic wave (rate ratio (RR): 4.90, 95% CI 4.07 to 5.89).

We first propose a multi-scalar theoretical framework of state entrepreneurialism to comprehend China\u2019s city-regional development. At the national scale, the central state maintains planning centrality by establishing normative goals through national political mandates and orchestrating socio-spatial reconfiguration of city-regions using various planning techniques (e.g., zoning, annexation, connectivity, and place-making), which demonstrates state spatial selectivity. At the local scale, city-regional development, led by the local state, pivots on the mandates and resorts to market instruments. Place-specific contexts and development trajectories give rise to distinctive \u2018regional models\u2019 and contingent socio-spatial processes. From a historical-geographical perspective, these contingent socio-spatial processes represent both the outcome of and the precondition for successive waves of state spatial selectivity in city-regional development. Building upon the dynamic interplay between state spatial selectivity and contingent socio-spatial processes, we present a periodised analysis to delve into the ongoing transformation from the PRD to the GBA. Amidst evolving global-local conjunctures and shifting national political mandates, state spatial selectivity within the PRD-to-GBA transformation is categorised into three periods: (1) 1980s to early 1990s: exploiting zoning technologies to institutionalise exceptionality within delimited areas for undertaking market-oriented experiments; (2) mid 1990s to 2000s: empowering entrepreneurial cities to drive market-oriented development while managing their size, internal hierarchy, and external connections; and (3) 2010s onwards: an intensified planning centrality at the national scale and the reinvention of zoning technologies to emphasise relationality, reshaping the urban-regional and cross-border dynamics of the GBA within an \u2018integration\u2019 framework.

It argues that for strategic geopolitical and economic reasons states increasingly govern, regulate, manage and own parts of the urban built environment. However, regulatory intervention in the city cannot be mistaken for a return to the post-war development state which strongly focused on promoting spatial development and industrial policy and protecting social welfarism and labour conditions.

The result is a failure to address the trade-offs inherent in the devolution process, alongside an inadequate engagement with the growing demand for democratic revitalisation.

Through the dual lenses of the efficiency-based decentralisation theorem and political economy analysis, I discuss how globalisation, technological upheaval, and innovations in governance have fundamentally reshaped the relationship between political centres and periphery within countries. The empirical evidence reveals decentralisation not as a linear progression but as an intricate interweaving of economic imperatives and political will.

China's leveraging of its market is a form of \u201cpredatory liberalism\u201d that weaponizes the networks of interdependence created by globalization. The United States and other like-minded partners have mostly used piecemeal \u201cde-risking\u201d measures such as decoupling, supply chain resilience, reshoring, and trade diversion to reduce dependence on China and thereby minimize vulnerability to its economic coercion. But these practices do not stop the Chinese government's economic bullying. \u201cCollective resilience\u201d is a peer competition strategy designed to deter the Xi Jinping regime's economic predation. What informs this strategy is the understanding that interdependence, even asymmetric interdependence, is a two-way street. Original trade data show that the previous and current targets of economic coercion by the Xi Jinping regime export over $46.6 billion worth of goods to China on which it is more than 70 percent dependent as a proportion of its total imports of those goods. These target states could band together in a collective resilience alliance and practice economic deterrence by promising to retaliate against China's high-dependence trade should Beijing act against any one of the alliance members.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-07-01", "synthetic_support_claim": "\"Collective resilience\" is a peer competition strategy designed to deter the Xi Jinping regime's economic predation.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "China\u2019s economic coercion tactics have significantly harmed the long-term economic growth of targeted states."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "cf2bff8927ba248d33cd44459ef4a7c0c5b04e74", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cf2bff8927ba248d33cd44459ef4a7c0c5b04e74", "title": "Reshoring concepts: definitions\u00a0and a structured bibliometric review", "abstract": "PurposeThe aim of this paper is to clearly mark the clusters in the related literature using bibliometric analysis and draw useful implications for the academic research purposes especially in the stream of Supply Chain Management (SCM).Design/methodology/approachBy employing rigorous selection criteria, sample articles were selected for synthesizing and conducting a bibliometric analysis. This paper tries to identify the significance of the concept of reshoring with the aspect of SCM, operations, logistics etc. Starting from sample selection, systematic selection criteria has been used to generate the database, using Scopus. The sample size was 184. Using VOSViewer, statistical and graphical representations were generated for clusters in the literature that will be useful for judging the trends of research under shoring concepts.FindingsFindings show that unclear difference compared to other supply chain concepts obstructs further theory development within reshoring concepts. To address this challenge, the review categorizes themes and defines boundaries. Based on the analysis findings, this paper advocates for additional research in areas that are crucial but have received limited or no attention. Specifically, there is a need for action research on motivations, governance modes, and location selection concerning reshoring decisions.Research limitations/implicationsThis review has a few limitations. The absence of publications in other language, than English, may result in a significant loss of knowledge. This research paper cited a few relevant publications in the form of conference papers, industry reports, books, and book chapters. Nonetheless, they were excluded from the organized bibliometric audit.

In this research, we integrate truth bias, elaboration likelihood model and new media literacy into a model for explaining social media engagement (with both disinformation and factual information) and analysing how political polarisation (operationalised as political alignment between users) influences perceptions and behaviours. Using an experimental design, we analyse the model separately for posts containing disinformation and factual information, highlighting key differences. Political alignment positively moderates truth bias's effect on engagement with disinformation. For both disinformation and factual information, political alignment moderates the effect of generalised communicative suspicion (GCS) on truth bias, such that GCS's effect on truth bias flips from negative to positive as political alignment increases. Issue involvement and political alignment appear to be the primary drivers of disinformation engagement, with critical consuming media literacy failing to mitigate engagement.

This study focuses on job promotions to uncover how algorithmic unfairness impacts managers' perceived fairness and their subsequent acceptance of DA recommendations. Through an experimental study, we find that (1) algorithmic unfairness (against women) in promotion recommendations reduces managers' perceived distributive fairness, influencing their acceptance of these recommendations; (2) managers' trust in DA competency moderates the relationship between perceived fairness and DA recommendation acceptance; and (3) managers' moral identity moderates the impact of algorithmic unfairness on perceived fairness.

Verifying Rules on Large-Scale Neural Network Training via Compute Monitoring", "abstract": "As advanced machine learning systems' capabilities begin to play a significant role in geopolitics and societal order, it may become imperative that (1) governments be able to enforce rules on the development of advanced ML systems within their borders, and (2) countries be able to verify each other's compliance with potential future international agreements on advanced ML development. This work analyzes one mechanism to achieve this, by monitoring the computing hardware used for large-scale NN training. The framework's primary goal is to provide governments high confidence that no actor uses large quantities of specialized ML chips to execute a training run in violation of agreed rules. At the same time, the system does not curtail the use of consumer computing devices, and maintains the privacy and confidentiality of ML practitioners' models, data, and hyperparameters. The system consists of interventions at three stages: (1) using on-chip firmware to occasionally save snapshots of the the neural network weights stored in device memory, in a form that an inspector could later retrieve; (2) saving sufficient information about each training run to prove to inspectors the details of the training run that had resulted in the snapshotted weights; and (3) monitoring the chip supply chain to ensure that no actor can avoid discovery by amassing a large quantity of un-tracked chips.

E-cigarette tax schema in the USA vary, in contrast to cigarette taxes that are standardised as an excise tax amount per pack. Some states use excise taxes on liquid and containers, others wholesale sales taxes and others retail sales taxes. Increasingly, states are taxing open system and closed system products differently. It is therefore difficult to understand the relative magnitudes of these e-cigarette taxes and their size relative to cigarette taxes.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo update and publish a database of state and local quarterly e-cigarette tax rates from 2010 to 2023, standardised as the rate per millilitre of fluid, for both closed system and open system products.\n\n\nMETHODS\nUsing Universal Product Code-level e-cigarette sales from the NielsenIQ Retail Scanner Data along with e-cigarette product characteristics collected from internet searches and visits to e-cigarette retailers, we develop a method to standardise e-cigarette tax rates as an equivalent average excise tax rate measured per millilitre of fluid.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn 2023, the average American resided in a location with $3.21 in cigarette taxes and $0.49 in closed system e-cigarette taxes (per 0.7 fluid millilitre).

We assessed the prevalence of nicotine pouch use among youth and adults in Great Britain (GB).\n\n\nAIMS AND METHODS\nCross-sectional annual Action on Smoking and Health Smokefree GB Adult Surveys 2020-2024 (n: 12\u2005247 to 13\u2005266, 18+) and Action on Smoking and Health Smokefree GB Youth Survey 2024 (n = 2872 11-18-year-olds). Weighted proportions and 95% confidence intervals for pouch ever and current use among adults over time, and in 2024 among youth and adults overall, by socio-demographics, mental health, tobacco smoking, vaping, past-12-month gambling, cannabis, and alcohol use; for youth also family members' smoking and vaping. Multivariable logistic regression assessed the association with ever pouch use.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe prevalence of adult ever and current use doubled from 2020 to 2024, reaching 5.4% (95% confidence interval = 5.0 to 5.8) and 1.0% (0.8-1.1). Among youth, 3.3% (2.7-4.0) reported ever use, including 1.2% (0.8-1.6) reporting current use. Ever use was associated with the use of other addictive products. Among adults, ever use was also more common among younger groups (18-24, 25-34, 35-44 vs. 55+), males, and those in rented accommodation or receiving mental health treatment. Among youth, ever use was also more common among those in London than elsewhere in England.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPouch use in GB is rare with about 1 in 100 youth and adults reporting current use. However, use appears to be increasing and is higher in some groups, including younger adults, males and people with experience of vaping, smoking, and use of other addictive products.\n\n\nIMPLICATIONS\nWhile currently low, close monitoring of pouch use is indicated. It is currently concentrated among those with experience of nicotine use.

The six stages include: (1) defining the research questions, (2) finding relevant studies, (3) selecting the studies, (4) organizing the data, (5) summarizing and reporting the results, and (6) consultation. This review explored the topic through the lens of Constructivist Theory, which posits that gender is socially and culturally constructed rather than biologically determined. This framework highlights the dynamic interaction between gender roles, societal norms, and electoral behavior, emphasizing the fluidity of gender in shaping voter perceptions and candidate evaluations. While the review identifies significant insights into how gender influences both political behavior and representation, it also underscores key gaps in the literature. Notably, there is a lack of comparative research on homophobic biases and their impact on the evaluation of non-binary candidates. Existing studies have not fully addressed the structural and cultural barriers LGBTQIA+ leaders face in political contexts. Another gap concerns the underexplored reasons why women and non-binary individuals may be less inclined to pursue political office. Despite the predominant focus on the positive impacts of gender in elections, the negative outcomes\u2014such as the reinforcement of gender-based stereotypes and the marginalization of female and non-binary candidates\u2014remain insufficiently studied. This review calls for future research to address these gaps, particularly regarding the unconscious biases voters may hold and the systemic barriers that affect perceptions of LGBTQIA+ leaders, in order to foster a more comprehensive understanding of gender\u2019s role in electoral decision-making.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2025-01-12", "synthetic_support_claim": "There is a lack of comparative research on homophobic biases impacting the evaluation of non-binary candidates.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Gender has no impact on voter decisions in elections."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "70e6d26a5bfc601c259ef2c81052308bf1161d60", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/70e6d26a5bfc601c259ef2c81052308bf1161d60", "title": "Lost in transition?

This article critically analyzes, by means of argumentative discourse analysis, the politics and policy process related to the recent adoption of the FuelEU Maritime regulation, the world\u2019s first legislation to set requirements for decarbonizing maritime shipping. Complementing previous research focusing on the roles and agency of policy entrepreneurs and beliefs of advocacy coalitions active in the policy process, this paper dives deeper into the politics of the new legislation. It aims to explore and explain the discursive framing and politics of meaning-making. By analyzing the political and social meaning-making of the concept \u201cdecarbonizing maritime shipping\u201d, this paper helps us understand why the legislation was designed in the way it was. Different narratives, storylines and discourses defining different meanings of decarbonization are analyzed. So is the agency of policy actors trying to mutate the different meanings into a new meaning. Two discourses developed in dialectic conversation framed the policy proposals and subsequent debates in the policy process, focusing on (i) incremental change and technology neutrality to meet moderate emission reductions and maintain competitiveness, and (ii) transformative change and technology specificity to meet zero emissions and gain competitiveness and global leadership in the transition towards a hydrogen economy. Policy actors successfully used discursive agency strategies such as multiple functionality and vagueness to navigate between and resolve conflicts between the two discourses. Both discourses are associated with the overarching ecological modernization discourse and failed to include issue of climate justice and a just transition. The heritage of the ecological modernization discourse creates lock-ins for a broader decarbonization discourse, thus stalling a just transition.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-06-29", "synthetic_support_claim": "The FuelEU Maritime regulation is the world\u2019s first legislation to set requirements for decarbonizing maritime shipping.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Decarbonizing maritime shipping will inevitably lead to significant job losses in the global shipping industry."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "20cff437e58de81cd90e786a7e1515da81523fd0", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/20cff437e58de81cd90e786a7e1515da81523fd0", "title": "The importance of practices of collective care: Exploring directions for an alternative productive paradigm fitting our times\u2019 social, economic and ecological requirements", "abstract": "The Anthropocene is characterized by multiple crises associated with the infinite accumulation of growth on a planet of finite resources.

This study aimed to understand youth perceptions of the impact and influence of a range of marketing and public relations strategies used by health harming industries. An online qualitative survey was conducted with n\u2005=\u2005518, 16- to 24-year-olds living in Victoria, Australia. Participants were asked to consider the broad influence of marketing from health harming industries on youth, including the impacts of social media promotions, corporate social responsibility strategies including sponsorship and political donations, as well as their views on marketing restrictions. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to construct themes from the data. Participants stated that excessive marketing strategies had a significant influence on youth consumption of health harming products. Most felt that social media marketing had the most appeal and influence on youth. Most were critical of these strategies and were supportive of strong restrictions on marketing for health-harming products. However, many participants held more positive views about corporate social responsibility strategies, which they perceived could offset the negative impacts of these industries on health. Increased focus is needed from the public health and health promotion communities to ensure that youth are protected from the influence of the range of marketing strategies that are used by health-harming industries to promote their products and resist regulatory reform.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2024-11-21", "synthetic_support_claim": "Excessive marketing strategies significantly influence youth consumption of health-harming products.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Youth are more influenced by traditional forms of commercial marketing than by social media marketing."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "04281bf1d6b532ebda38c9309999e51d82708cc8", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/04281bf1d6b532ebda38c9309999e51d82708cc8", "title": "T\u00fcrkiye\u2019nin \u0130klim De\u011fi\u015fikli\u011fine Y\u00f6nelik Politikalar\u0131 ve Kurumsal Yap\u0131s\u0131", "abstract": "\u0130klim de\u011fi\u015fikli\u011fi yaln\u0131zca hava desenlerindeki de\u011fi\u015fikliklerle ilgili de\u011fildir; ekosistemleri, toplumu ve acil eylem gerektiren bir\u00e7ok ba\u015fka alan\u0131 da etkiler.

From the global experience, medical control and social control are the two main dimensions in the prevention and control of COVID-19. From the perspective of \u201ctwo types of control\u201d, namely medical control and social control, this paper finds that the political system, economic structure, and cultural values of the United States greatly limit the government\u2019s ability to impose social control, forcing it to adopt medical control to fight the virus in a single dimension. In contrast, China\u2019s political system, economic structure, and cultural values allow its government to adopt stringent, extensive, and frequent social control, as well as medical control to fight the virus. This approach departs from the traditional pathway of fighting the epidemic, i.e., \u201cinfection\u2013treatment\u2013immunization\u201d, thereby outpacing the evolution of the virus and controlling its spread more rapidly. This finding helps explain why the Chinese government adopted a strict \u201czeroing\u201d and \u201cdynamic zeroing\u201d policy during the first three years, at the cost of enormous economic, social, and even political legitimacy. It was not until late 2022, when the Omicron variant with the waning virulence became prevalent, that China chose to \u201ccoexist\u201d with the virus, thus avoiding a massive epidemic-related death. While the United States adopted a pulsed-style strategy at the beginning of the epidemic, i.e., \u201crelaxation\u2013suppression\u2013relaxation\u2013suppression\u201d, and began to \u201ccoexist\u201d with the virus in just one year, resulting in a large number of excess deaths associated with the epidemic. The study contributes to explaining the difference in the interplay between public health priorities and COVID-19 response strategies in China and the United States, based on the specific public health context and the perspective of \u201cmedical control\u201d and \u201csocial control\u201d.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-06-26", "synthetic_support_claim": "China's stringent social control measures allowed it to control COVID-19's spread more rapidly than the United States.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "COVID-19 vaccines produced superior immunity in populations under social control compared to those under medical control."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "69d7926541c6aeacc15e9f49a39fd77fe77b75b1", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/69d7926541c6aeacc15e9f49a39fd77fe77b75b1", "title": "Comparative analysis of state-level policy responses in global health governance: A scoping review using COVID-19 as a case", "abstract": "Background States are key actors in global health governance, particularly in the prevention and control of infectious diseases. The emergence and re-emergence of infectious diseases in recent decades pose profound challenges to global health security. As the first coronavirus pandemic, the COVID-19 caused significant damage worldwide, but responses and outcomes varied greatly among states. Using COVID-19 as an example, this study aims to compare the policies and measures implemented by different states during the COVID-19 pandemic and to synthesize experiences to strengthen global health governance for future infectious disease crises.

English databases were searched using combinations of keywords and articles examining COVID-19 prevention and control policies in representative countries were included. A comparative analysis across these four states (United States, Sweden, India, and Nigeria) was then conducted to analyse the differences, rationale, and challenges of the approaches taken by these states. Results A total of 36 studies were included in the analysis. The management of the COVID-19 by states is divided into two main categories: domestic governance and international governance. Domestically, the United States and India have taken more measures, yet notable disparities in infection source control, transmission interruption, vulnerable population protection, collaborative governance, and so on were observed among all four states. Globally, the United States and Sweden were more proactive in international governance, and all four states have variations in their adherence to global regulations, information sharing, resource distribution, and cooperative engagement. Conclusions Significant disparities occurred during the response to early COVID-19 in four states, which may be due to differences in politics, economy, and culture.

This study examines the development of a pairing assistance policy by the Chinese Government through its central authority to foster collaborative governance among local governments in areas affected by COVID-19. Methods The aim of the study was to gain a clear understanding of how the policy of pairing assistance in public health emergencies is successfully implemented through the top-down application of authority. A case study design was used as a methodology to present an explanatory framework for implementing pairing assistance policies during major public crises. We focus on the operational process of pairing assistance, using the assistance provided by Jiangsu Province to Huangshi City in Hubei Province as an illustration. Results This paper finds that responding to a crisis requires the guidance of a central authority and the cooperation of local governments. The process is driven by three key factors: the vertical intervention of the crisis, the inevitability of horizontal cooperation and the policy allocation and incentives of the bureaucracy. The three stages of co-operative governance based on authoritative regulation work together in a step-by-step manner to enhance the effectiveness of crisis response. Conclusion The results of the study indicate that collaborative governance under the authoritative regulation is the main reason why provincial counterpart support mechanism plays a great role in COVID-19.

Examining the formation of a political project around an emerging hydrogen economy in South Africa, this article shows that a hydrogen transition is fundamentally contested. Employing (neo-)Gramscian hegemony theory and historical materialist policy analysis, it delineates four competing hydrogen initiatives in the policy debate: green extractivism, green developmentalism, fossilism and energy justice. The findings indicate the dominance of green extractivism, which prioritises the export of green hydrogen to Europe and reproduces patterns of neocolonialism and unequal ecological exchange. Contestations arise both from reactionary forces clinging to fossil fuels as well as from initiatives pursuing justice-centred transitions through green developmentalism and energy justice.

As a top CO2-emitting country, hydrogen (especially green hydrogen) production in South Africa has gained momentum due to the availability of resources, such as solar energy, land, wind energy, platinum group metals (as catalysts for electrolysers), and water. However, the demand for green hydrogen in South Africa is insignificant, which implies that the majority of the production must be exported. Despite the positive developments, there are unclear matters, such as dependence on the national electricity grid for green hydrogen production and the cost of transporting it to Asian and European markets. Hence, this study aims to explore opportunities for economic expansion for sustainable production, transportation, storage, and utilisation of green hydrogen produced in South Africa. This paper uses a thematic literature review methodology. The key findings are that the available renewable energy sources, incentivizing the green economy, carbon taxation, and increasing the demand for green hydrogen in South Africa and Africa could decrease the cost of hydrogen from 3.54 to 1.40 \u20ac/kgH2 and thus stimulate its production, usage, and export. The appeal of green hydrogen lies in diversifying products to green hydrogen as an energy carrier, clean electricity, synthetic fuels, green ammonia and methanol, green fertilizers, and green steel production with the principal purpose of significant energy decarbonisation and economic and foreign earnings.

Drawing on public documents, interviews, and ethnographic observations, we study Bilibili, a leading online participatory platform for Generation Z. We argue that Bilibili has adopted a \u201cbidirectional mediation\u201d approach to actively mediate between users and the party-state. In this approach, the key to online governance is finding, or even cultivating, common grounds between users and the party-state and proactively facilitating communications between the two sides.

But the opacity of such algorithms introduces socially consequential and often problematic mechanisms of classification. Given the playful resistance of queer individuals against a normative social environment, the interaction between algorithms and content creators warrants close examination. This study investigates how LGBTQ+ content creators navigate these algorithm-driven platforms, focusing on their negotiation of digital normativity to share non-heterosexual content and foster queer sociality in China. Avoiding the oversimplification of viewing algorithms and those implementing them as monolithic entities, I explore how content creators creatively manage to produce and distribute their work within the constraints of these platforms, and even by playing with these constraints. I collected data from an ethnography on algorithms, interviews, and an open-source investigation into recommendation algorithms, through a scavenge approach. I argue that LGBTQ+ content creators engage with algorithms in ways that are simultaneously non-conforming and non-confrontational. They imagine algorithmic effects, appropriate outcomes, and play with the opacity of machine learning to navigate three aspects of digital normativity in China: heteronormativity, Internet civilization, and commercialization. Empirically, I identified three strategies used to create and expand queer sociality within these constraints: camouflaging, filtering, and verticalizing.

In recent years, digital religious activities have emerged on Chinese social media platforms, with the sharing and promotion of content related to religious activities becoming increasingly popular. In a country like China, which adheres to atheistic ideology, the emergence of religious activities among the Generation Z youth provides a unique case for academic research. However, there is very limited research on digital religious behavior in mainland China. This study fills this gap by extending the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to predict additional influencing factors of digital religious intentions and behavior. Methods This study employed a quantitative design, disseminating surveys via Sina Weibo and the Douyin platform. We collected a total of 525 valid responses. This study aims to deeply explore the social and psychological factors generated by digital religious activities on social media platforms, particularly how they stimulate Chinese Generation Z youth to participate in digital religious activities. Results The results show that attitudes toward digital religion, perceived behavioral control, social identity, and empathetic willingness are predictors of intentions, while social norms are not. Intentions significantly predict users\u2019behavior on social media platforms such as Weibo and Douyin. Moreover, empathetic willingness and social identity fully mediate the effects of subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and attitudes on intentions. Consequently, these behaviors generate impact, indicating the presence of multiple mediation effects. Discussion Unlike the societal context of theistic nations, there is a pronounced atheistic inclination within Chinese society. Consequently, subjective norms do not influence the digital religious behaviors of Chinese youth. Among contemporary Chinese youth, participation in digital religious practices is a temporary, secular activity undertaken only as a comforting behavior when anxiety becomes unmanageable or surpasses their threshold of tolerance. In contemporary China, young people face immense pressures stemming from workplace competition, social interactions, and economic burdens. Social media offers these young individuals broader opportunities for connection, community formation, and identity construction, as well as various possibilities for organizing their social lives. Consequently, on one hand, they turn to online religious avenues, seeking understanding from others through shared experiences, thereby obtaining emotional solace and comfort. On the other hand, they look to spiritual beliefs to alleviate anxiety, resolve confusion, and gain psychological comfort through emotional exchanges. Therefore, digital religion can, to some extent, be viewed as a form of social-technological empowerment, providing contemporary youth with a new \u201cpressure valve\u201d to facilitate emotional relief, comfort, and tension alleviation.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2025-01-30", "synthetic_support_claim": "Subjective norms do not influence the digital religious behaviors of Chinese Generation Z youth.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Chinese Generation Z youth engage in digital religious activities primarily to strengthen their faith in religion."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "c62d0ab6a31ab89d4f7a9fc8475da3f2bc68f1d4", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c62d0ab6a31ab89d4f7a9fc8475da3f2bc68f1d4", "title": "Universal health coverage evolution, ongoing trend, and future challenge: A conceptual and historical policy review", "abstract": "The goal of universal health coverage (UHC) from the United Nations (UN) has metamorphized from its early phase of primary health care (PHC) to the recent sustainable development goal (SDG).

This vulnerable situation has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic which disrupted and exposed the fragile nature of equitable access to vaccines for childhood immunisation globally. A systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the association of country income status and GDP with vaccination coverage of vaccines for childhood immunisation and other major infectious diseases around the globe will inform global and national policy on equity in living standards and vaccine uptake. This study was carried out to identify factors influenced by GDP that affect access, distribution, and uptake of childhood vaccines around the world using a systematic review and meta-analysis approach. Methods Data were extracted for the burden of major infectious diseases of childhood immunisation programmes, factors affecting access to vaccines, vaccine procurement platforms, vaccination coverage and percentage of GDP used for the procurement of vaccines. Factors influencing the global vaccination coverage rate were also assessed. The protocol was registered on PROSPERO (ID: CRD42022350418) and carried out using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Results Data from 195 countries showed that the following infectious diseases had the highest burden; human papillomavirus (HPV), measles, Ebola and yellow fever. Low-income and some lower-middle-income countries (LMICs) used COVAX and UNICEF for vaccine procurement while high-income countries (HICs) preferred national and regional public tenders. Global vaccination coverage for tuberculosis, diphtheria/tetanus/pertussis, hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type b, measles, polio, meningitis and HPV had a significantly higher coverage than COVID-19. Being an HIC and having coverage data collected from 1985 to 2015 as the most current data were associated with high vaccination coverage. The percentage of GDP spent on vaccine procurement did not influence vaccination coverage.

This study empirically investigates the impact of digitization on urban industrial structures, technological innovation, public service levels, and social\u2013ecological resilience. Various approaches, including the two-tier stochastic, spatial econometric, and panel threshold models, have been employed to analyze panel data from 287 cities from 2008 to 2023. These data are examined through a quasi-natural experiment analyzing the evolution of urban social\u2013ecological resilience following China\u2019s promotion of the national comprehensive pilot zone for big data. The findings are as follows. (1) The positive effects of digitization on urban social and ecological resilience substantially outweigh the negative effects, with an overall increasing trend in the positive net effect, albeit with significant regional differences. (2) Digitalization exhibits a significant spatial spillover effect, enhancing local social\u2013ecological resilience while inhibiting improvements in neighboring cities. (3) Technological innovation and public service levels positively affect social\u2013ecological resilience, whereas industrial structure upgrading has a negative indirect effect. Both industrial structure upgrading and public service levels demonstrate nonlinear effects under the threshold constraints of the intermediary mechanism.

It argued further that bandits\u2019 attacks on these rural communities created an upheaval in the environment, bringing about looting, kidnapping, maiming, and loss of lives and property of serious magnitude. The deadly attacks on these various communities, their desertion, and the displacement of family members led to a humanitarian crisis of multiple dimensions.

Bandits-free and bandits persistence were established. Also, the threshold parameter (Reproduction Number (Rc)) used to measure the level of banditry activities was established, as (Rc<1), banditry activities die out from the dynamical system, and if Rc>1 the banditry persists Rc>1, in the system. Numerical results demonstrate that banditry is effectively curbed when Rc<1 and persists otherwise.

This discussion arises from differing interpretations of existing texts, which have persisted from the classical era to the contemporary period. This study employs normative legal research, utilizing library materials and secondary data as primary sources. It involves reviewing literature, including articles, books, and other relevant resources. The collected data, comprising primary and secondary legal materials, is analyzed qualitatively and presented descriptively. The study finds that Islam upholds gender equality by placing women in a noble and honorable position and affirming their rights and roles as stated in the words of Allah. Among classical Islamic scholars, there is debate about whether women are permitted to hold leadership roles. Imam Malik, Imam Shafi'i, and Ahmad Ibn Hanbal prohibited it, while Imam Abu Hanifah allowed women to lead if they possessed adequate capability and competence. Scholars like Ibn Jarir Al-Tabari and Ibn Hazm also allowed women to assume leadership positions without any conditions. Contemporary scholars, including Ibn Ashur, Yusuf al-Qaradawi, and Quraish Shihab, support women's participation in politics, both in voting and being elected. Yusuf al-Qaradawi, however, set conditions, emphasizing that women must adhere to Islamic ethics, fulfill their duties as wives and mothers, and not violate Sharia principles. If the exercise of women's political rights leads to harm, it is prohibited based on the principle of sadd al-zari'ah.

Our results indicate that FRs are effective in mitigating sovereign default risk, as measured by credit default swap (CDS) spreads on sovereign bonds. In addition, we document that Member States with better numerical compliance rates with European Union fiscal rules have lower sovereign CDS spreads and thus lower risk. By overseeing and fostering compliance with numerical fiscal targets and enhancing the transparency of the budgetary process, IFIs exert a beneficial impact on the probability of sovereign default, particularly those subject to institutional reforms.

Despite the growing adoption of data-driven decision-making systems in the public sector, efforts to integrate equity as a primary goal often fall short. This typically arises from inadequate early-stage involvement of underserved stakeholders and prevalent misunderstandings concerning the authentic meaning of equity from these stakeholders' perspectives. Our research seeks to address this gap by actively involving undersevered stakeholders in the process of envisioning the integration of equity within public sector data-driven decisions, particularly in the context of a building department in a Northeastern mid-sized U.S. city. Applying a speed dating method with storyboards, we explore diverse equity-centric futures within the realm of local business development, a domain where small businesses, particularly women-and minority-owned businesses, historically confront inequitable distribution of public services. We explored three essential aspects of equity: monitoring equity, resource allocation prioritization, as well as information and equity. Our findings illuminate the complexities of integrating equity into data-driven decisions, offering nuanced insights about the needs of stakeholders. We found that attempts to monitor and incorporate equity goals into public sector decision-making can unexpectedly backfire, inadvertently sparking community apprehension and potentially exacerbating existing inequities. Small business owners, including those identifying as women-and minority-owned, advocated against the use of demographic-based data in equity-focused data-driven decision-making in the public sector, instead emphasizing factors such as community needs, application complexity, and uncertainties inherent in small businesses.

Many of the critiques of Zionism deploy frameworks of apartheid, understood by radicals in South Africa as a social structure reproduced by racial capitalism. It was understood that such a system could only be effectively dismantled through a national liberation project which understood race, class, capital and Imperialism as a single contradiction which must be overthrown as a totality. Similarly, earlier theorists within the Palestinian anti-colonial struggle, such as Fayez Sayegh, understood Zionist settler colonialism as an outpost of Western Imperialism.

E. B. Du Bois is finally recognized as one of the founders of sociology, a social theorist, and a methodological innovator. The recognition of Du Bois' work is accompanied by the emergence of a contemporary Du Boisian sociology. This sociology takes inspiration from the work of Du Bois, but it does not limit itself to his work. It aims to bring into sociology the work of scholars that so far have been confined to the margins of the discipline, among them, Franz Fanon and Stuart Hall. Yet, as Du Bois work gets increasing visibility, important debates emerge. One of these debates concerns Du Bois' relation to Marxism, and the relationship between Du Boisian sociology to Marxist sociology. Marxist sociologists argue that Du Bois' late work, as well as the work of Franz Fanon and Stuart Hall, belongs in the Marxist tradition. In this essay I argue that while Du Bois, Fanon, and Hall were sympathetic to Marxism, their work cannot be encapsulated within the Marxist tradition. The question of the human was central to their thought. Moreover, for them colonialism and racism structure identity, lived experience and politics under capitalism in ways that are not reducible to class and class conflict.

Although FISM reproduce the fiction of state power as expressing the will of the sovereign nation to defend itself against foreign interference, market distortion, and technology theft, they consist of legally enshrining state authority to support national champions, and making sure they engage favorably with competitive dynamics of capital centralization, notably by conserving their monopoly over key intangible assets and strategic resources.

Research to date typically focuses on how burdens affect decisions in specific policy contexts, thus little is known about everyday experiences of burdens and their distribution in society. This is the first study to document everyday administrative experiences, accounting for time and emotional costs across ten domains: tax, retirement, government benefits, bills, goods and services, savings, debt, health, childcare, and adult care. Results from 2,243 UK adults show that administrative tasks are a significant part of life (one hour per day). Time and emotional costs vary by domain; government benefits emerge as particularly costly. There is evidence that administrative burdens are regressive, not only through their effects on decisions, but through their unequal distribution in society. Those in poor health and financial insecurity focus on tasks salient to them (e.g. benefits, health, debt), but are less likely to engage in beneficial longer-term tasks (e.g. savings, retirement), and suffer higher emotional costs from engaging in tasks relevant to their disadvantage, compared to non-disadvantaged groups.

Drawing on insights from extensive ethnographic fieldwork conducted along India\u2019s highway corridors, this paper examines the authoritarianism and social fragmentation inherent in the state\u2019s attempts to extend infrastructure-led urbanisation into economically bypassed regions. By exploring the intersections between the construction of recent highway corridors through previously bypassed regions inhabited by marginalised religious and caste groups and the outbreak of state-backed violence, this paper analyses authoritarian urbanism emerging amidst social struggles over enclosure and urbanisation of agrarian land. Specifically, the paper delves in depth into the planning of two recent highway corridors \u2013 the Delhi\u2013Mumbai Expressway and the India\u2013Myanmar\u2013Thailand highway \u2013 and the escalation of state-sponsored religious conflicts and polarisation in the regions these corridors traverse. This research demonstrates how national-scale infrastructure projects, such as the Bharatmala highway programme, allow for the framing of a national-popular project that selectively incorporates hegemonic socio-religious groups such as certain Hindu caste groups who have reaped the primary benefits of economic liberalisation while disenfranchising marginalised communities. The paper defines authoritarian urbanism as a more-than-neoliberal configuration emerging from a toxic amalgamation of state power, bellicose militarism, infrastructure-led urbanisation and religious nationalism.

However, little is known about the extent to which change has occurred over the last decade with implementing programs and policies across all 13 provincial and territorial jurisdictions. There is significant variation in the degree of implementation of structural features of high\u2010performing primary care systems across Canada. This study provides evidence on the state of primary care reform in Canada and offers insights into the opportunities based on changes that governments elsewhere have made to advance primary care transformation. Context Despite significant investments to transform primary care, Canada lags behind its peers in providing timely access to regular doctors or places of care, timely access to care, developing interprofessional teams, and communication across health care settings. This study examines changes over the last decade (2012 to 2021) in policies across 13 provincial and territorial jurisdictions that address the structural features of high\u2010performing primary care systems. Methods A multiple comparative case study approach was used to explore changes in primary care delivery across 13 Canadian jurisdictions. Each case consisted of (1) qualitative interviews with academics, provincial health care leaders, and health care professionals and (2) a literature review of policies and innovations. Data for each case were thematically analyzed within and across cases, using 12 structural features of high\u2010performing primary care systems to describe each case and assess changes over time. Findings The most significant changes include adopting electronic medical records, investments in quality improvement training and support, and developing interprofessional teams. Progress was more limited in implementing primary care governance mechanisms, system coordination, patient enrollment, and payment models. The rate of change was slowest for patient engagement, leadership development, performance measurement, research capacity, and systematic evaluation of innovation. Conclusions Progress toward building high\u2010performing primary care systems in Canada has been slow and variable, with limited change in the organization and delivery of primary care. Canada's experience can inform innovation internationally by demonstrating how preexisting policy legacies constrain the possibilities for widespread primary care reform, with progress less pronounced in the attributes that impact physician autonomy. To accelerate primary care transformation in Canada and abroad, a national strategy and performance measurement framework is needed based on meaningful engagement of patients and other stakeholders.

The data was collected through computer-assisted web interviewing by MNFORCE, a well-known market research firm. The empirical research was conducted in June 2022. The fundamental relationships and interconnections between CSR and the use of a participatory management approach were substantiated through the application of regression analysis. The research results demonstrated that a portion of these CSR factors significantly affects the application of participative leadership in SMEs. The strongest impact is observed for entrepreneurs' belief that CSR makes it possible to acquire satisfied, loyal, and motivated employees. The second most significant factor determining the application of participative leadership style was factor X3 (the average value of the correlation coefficient was 0.208). The potential opportunity to gain competitive advantage through the implementation of CSR also motivates entrepreneurs to apply participative leadership in SMEs; as the third most significant factor, it had an average correlation coefficient of 0.199. Finally, entrepreneurs' belief that implementing CSR has an impact on improving firm performance also proved motivating for SMEs. This study has significant practical implications.

Based on this line of thought, the present contribution delves into the details of the CAP\u2019s shift, focusing on the main environmental concerns faced in the policy-making framework. Grounded in a political science perspective, the current study looks at how environmental and climate change concerns were gradually elevated inside the CAP\u2019s policy-making framework and how they helped create the \u201cgreen architecture\u201d for European agriculture. Examining the process of policy change under the lens of historical institutionalism and neo-institutionalism within the multilevel governance framework of the European Union (EU), the key role played by the gradual introduction of measures aimed at promoting measurable environmental criteria and climatic targets is highlighted. For instance, measures aimed at preserving carbon-rich soils and enhancing water resources can have positive impacts on the environment. However, these measures were also recognized to increase the cost of production for the European farmers, who faced serious difficulties in adjusting to the new framework. Within this context, this research delves into the roles played by two additional fundamental entities: the consumer and environmental activism. Additionally, the study underscores the EU\u2019s commitment to addressing climate change and sustainable development challenges and how conditionality is being used to link funding to results. Upon analyzing the CAP\u2019s shift, the reflection of a more flexible and rational approach is argued to be embodied by the new policy architecture. By incorporating both CAP pillars, encouraging collaboration with compatible policies, and allowing for greater adaptability in response to the unique circumstances and objectives of each member state, the CAP is taking significant steps towards sustainability and climate action.

Long-term research initiatives have provided relatively well-known examples of the continuous assessment of the desertification risk carried out via multiple exercises from different academic and practitioner stakeholders, frequently using the Environmentally Sensitive Area Index (ESAI). This composite index based on a large number of elementary variables and individual indicators\u2014spanning from the climate to soil quality and from vegetation cover to land-use intensity\u2014facilitated the comprehensive, long-term monitoring of the early desertification risk at disaggregated spatial scales, being of some relevance for policy implementation.

Taken as a proxy of the early desertification risk in advanced economies, the ESAI scores increased over time as a result of worse climate regimes (namely, drier and warmer conditions), landscape change, and rising human pressure that exacerbated related processes, such as soil erosion, salinization, compaction, sealing, water scarcity, wildfires, and overgrazing.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-10-26", "synthetic_support_claim": "The ESAI scores increased over time due to worsening climate, landscape changes, and rising human pressure.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Italy's early desertification risk is entirely due to natural climate variations, independent of human activities."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "d394c4a8f6997dbef9601e450ebb3ae3cb6ee435", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d394c4a8f6997dbef9601e450ebb3ae3cb6ee435", "title": "Quantifying the Performance of European Agriculture Through the New European Sustainability Model", "abstract": "The study aims to assess the performance of European sustainable agriculture through a new model of agricultural sustainability, addressing a significant gap identified in the literature: the lack of a systematic framework integrating the economic, environmental, and resource efficiency dimensions of agricultural resource use in the context of the EU Common Agricultural Policy and the Green Deal.

Coordinated information operations frequently spread mis/disinformation through inauthentic or \u201ctroll\u201d accounts that appear to be trustworthy members to the targeted polity, as in Russia's attempts to influence the 2016 US presidential election. We experimentally tested the efficacy of inoculation against inauthentic online actors, using the Spot the Troll Quiz, a free, online educational tool that teaches how to spot markers of inauthenticity. Inoculation works in this setting. Across an online US nationally representative sample (N = 2,847), which also oversampled older adults, we find that taking the Spot the Troll Quiz (vs. playing a simple game) significantly increases participants\u2019 accuracy in identifying trolls among a set of Twitter accounts that are novel to participants. This inoculation also reduces participants\u2019 self-efficacy in identifying inauthentic accounts and reduced the perceived reliability of fake news headlines, although it had no effect on affective polarization. And while accuracy in the novel troll-spotting task is negatively associated with age and Republican party identification, the Quiz is equally effective on older adults and Republicans as it was on younger adults and Democrats.

The second argument extends the first argument by considering how temporality is 'captured' by colonialism to foreground and universalize Western subjectivities and sensibilities. We use what Derek Hook calls a psycho-societal-diagnostic framework in conjunction with Fanon to show how subjectivities are structured in post-apartheid South Africa.

Fairness issues in LLMs can lead to severe consequences, such as bias amplification, discrimination, and harm to marginalized communities. While existing fairness benchmarks mainly focus on single-turn dialogues, multi-turn scenarios, which in fact better reflect real-world conversations, present greater challenges due to conversational complexity and potential bias accumulation. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive fairness benchmark for LLMs in multi-turn dialogue scenarios, \\textbf{FairMT-Bench}. Specifically, we formulate a task taxonomy targeting LLM fairness capabilities across three stages: context understanding, user interaction, and instruction trade-offs, with each stage comprising two tasks.

For evaluation, GPT-4 is applied, alongside bias classifiers including Llama-Guard-3 and human validation to ensure robustness. Experiments and analyses on \\texttt{FairMT-10K} reveal that in multi-turn dialogue scenarios, current LLMs are more likely to generate biased responses, and there is significant variation in performance across different tasks and models. Based on this, we curate a challenging dataset, \\texttt{FairMT-1K}, and test 15 current state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs on this dataset.

Although social media platforms such as TikTok have begun labeling AIGC to facilitate the ability for users to distinguish it from human-generated content, little research has been performed to examine the effect of these AIGC labels.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThis study investigated the impact of AIGC labels on perceived accuracy, message credibility, and sharing intention for misinformation through a web-based experimental design, aiming to refine the strategic application of AIGC labels.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe study conducted a 2\u00d72\u00d72 mixed experimental design, using the AIGC labels (presence vs absence) as the between-subjects factor and information type (accurate vs inaccurate) and content category (for-profit vs not-for-profit) as within-subjects factors. Participants, recruited via the Credamo platform, were randomly assigned to either an experimental group (with labels) or a control group (without labels). Each participant evaluated 4 sets of content, providing feedback on perceived accuracy, message credibility, and sharing intention for misinformation. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 29 and included repeated-measures ANOVA and simple effects analysis, with significance set at P<.05.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAs of April 2024, this study recruited a total of 957 participants, and after screening, 400 participants each were allocated to the experimental and control groups. The main effects of AIGC labels were not significant for perceived accuracy, message credibility, or sharing intention. However, the main effects of information type were significant for all 3 dependent variables (P<.001), as were the effects of content category (P<.001). There were significant differences in interaction effects among the 3 variables. For perceived accuracy, the interaction between information type and content category was significant (P=.005). For message credibility, the interaction between information type and content category was significant (P<.001). Regarding sharing intention, both the interaction between information type and content category (P<.001) and the interaction between information type and AIGC labels (P=.008) were significant.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study found that AIGC labels minimally affect perceived accuracy, message credibility, or sharing intention but help distinguish AIGC from human-generated content. The labels do not negatively impact users' perceptions of platform content, indicating their potential for fact-checking and governance. However, AIGC labeling applications should vary by information type; they can slightly enhance sharing intention and perceived accuracy for misinformation.

Beginning in 2015, the Bank of England (BoE) was among the first movers to do so. This article illustrates how two institutional features were key in enabling this response. First, the macroprudential framework that developed in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) has provided the key ideas that central bankers have used to understand climate change in relation to their objectives. Additionally, government support for BoE action on climate change was also essential in empowering the BoE by setting a transition pathway and providing political legitimacy. The result has been BoE policies that not only seek to limit climate-related risks but also actively shift credit toward greener enterprises. However, this article argues that this has not amounted to a green paradigm shift in the BoE's institutional role, but is better understood as a thermostatic mode of policy innovation. While the BoE's hierarchy of goals have not changed, the types of policy problems relevant to those goals has shifted substantially. Finally, this article offers reflections on the scope and durability of the BoE's approach to climate change in this context. This article contributes to the literature on central banking and climate change beyond the BoE by providing a framework for understanding the possibilities and limitations of current central bank approaches to climate change. Key policy insights Financial policymakers face uncertainty about which policies lie within the bounds of their institutional roles and norms as the causes of climate change become increasingly relevant for them to address. Central banks can function as \u2018thermostats\u2019, with relevant policy problems and instrument types changing substantially in order to maintain enduring goals like price and financial stability. While the scope of this type of response is potentially broad, the durability of policy action will be limited in the presence of other events in the economic environment.

Following these goals, and as expected, the transition to \u201cgreen\u201d renewable energy is growing and will be intensified, in the near future. One of the main pillars of this transition, particularly for Mediterranean countries, is solar photovoltaic (PV) power. However, this is the least land-efficient energy source, while it is also highly competitive in food production, since solar parks are often developed in former agricultural areas, thus resulting in the systematic reduction in arable lands. Therefore, in the context of PV energy planning, the protection and preservation of arable lands should be considered a key issue. The emerging technology of agrovoltaics offers a balanced solution for both agricultural and renewable energy development. The sustainable \u201csymbiosis\u201d of food and energy under common lands also supports the specific objective of the post-2020 Common Agricultural Policy, regarding the mitigation of and adaptation to the changing climate, as well as the highly uncertain socio-economic and geopolitical environment. The purpose of this study is twofold, i.e., (a) to identify the state of play of the technologies and energy efficiency measures of agrovoltaics, and (b) to present a comprehensive analysis of their interactions with the water\u2013energy\u2013food\u2013land nexus.

For instance, solar photovoltaic (PV) energy is driven by two processes, namely solar radiation, which is the main input, and ambient temperature, with the latter affecting the panel efficiency under specific weather conditions. The objective of this work is to provide a comprehensive investigation of the role of spatial scale by assessing the theoretical advantages of the distributed production of renewable energy sources over those of centralized, in probabilistic means. Acknowledging previous efforts for the optimal spatial distribution of different power units across predetermined locations, often employing the Modern Portfolio Theory framework, this work introduces the generic concept of spatial reliability and highlights its practical use as a strategic planning tool for assessing the benefits of distributed generation at a large scale. The methodology is verified by considering the case of Greece, where PV solar energy is one of the predominant renewables.

We then assess current challenges with using data donations for research and offer recommendations for various stakeholders to better align portability mechanisms with the needs of research.

We designed, pre-registered, and ran a survey experiment in Ireland to test the effects of mini-publics on legitimacy perceptions conditional on whether or not their non-binding policy recommendations are honored (N\u2009=\u20091309).

As a consequential-effect, a reduction in the spread of all respiratory viruses has been observed, but the primary factors behind this phenomenon have yet to be identified. We conducted a subgroup analysis of participants from the ELISA study, a prospective longitudinal cohort study on SARS-CoV-2 transmission, at four timepoints from November 2020 \u2013 September 2022. The aim was to provide a detailed overview of the circulation of respiratory viruses over 2\u2009years and to identify potential personal risk factors of virus distribution. All participants were screened using qPCR for respiratory viral infections from nasopharyngeal swabs and answered a questionnaire regarding behavioral factors. Several categories of risk factors for the transmission of respiratory viruses were evaluated using a scoring system. In total, 1,124 participants were included in the study, showing high adherence to governmental-introduced NPI. The overall number of respiratory virus infections was low (0\u20134.9% of participants), with adenovirus (1.7%), rhino\u2212/enterovirus (3.2%) and SARS-CoV-2 (1.2%) being the most abundant. We detected an inverse correlation between the number and intensity of NPI and the number of detected respiratory viruses. More precisely, the attendance of social events and household size was associated with rhino\u2212/enterovirus infection while social contacts were associated with being positive for any virus. NPI introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic reduced the occurrence of seasonal respiratory viruses in our study, showing different risk-factors for enhanced transmission between viruses.

Consequently, there is a need to assess the varied unintended consequences associated with PHSM implemented in the school setting, for students, teachers, and school staff, as well as for families and the wider community. This is an update of a Cochrane scoping review first published in 2022.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo comprehensively identify and summarise the published literature on the unintended consequences of public health and social measures implemented in the school setting to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2. This will serve to identify critical knowledge gaps to inform future primary research and systematic reviews. It may also serve as a resource for future pandemic management.\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nWe searched MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, PsycINFO, ERIC, and Web of Science on 5 and 6 January 2023. We also searched two COVID-19-specific databases (Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease). Finally, we reviewed the included studies of all relevant systematic reviews and guidelines identified through the searches.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nWe included studies that empirically assessed the impact of PHSM implemented in the school setting to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2. We imposed no restrictions with regard to the types of populations and specific interventions. Outcomes of interest were consequences that were measured or experienced, but not anticipated consequences. This review focused on real-world evidence: empirical quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-method studies were eligible for inclusion, but modelling studies were ineligible.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nThe review was guided by a logic model. In line with the latest Cochrane effectiveness review of school measures to contain COVID-19 and a conceptual framework of PHSM, this logic model distinguishes between measures to make contacts safer (related to individual protection and the physical environment), measures to reduce contacts (related to social interactions, movement, and services) and surveillance and response measures. Unintended consequences comprise the following categories: health and well-being, health system and social welfare services, human and fundamental rights, acceptability and adherence, equality and equity, social and institutional, economic and resource, and ecological. The review team screened all titles and abstracts, then potentially eligible full-text articles, in duplicate. Across the included studies, we summarised and presented types of measures, consequences, and study designs using the predefined categories of the logic model, while allowing for emerging categories.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nWe included 60 studies (57 new to this update) from 25 countries. There were 31 quantitative studies, 17 qualitative studies, and 12 mixed-method studies. Most targeted either students (26 studies), teachers and school staff (11 studies), or students and school staff (12 studies). Others evaluated measures aimed at parents (2 studies), staff and parents (1 study), students and teachers (3 studies), or the whole school (5 studies). The measures were related to individual protection (26 studies), the physical environment (20 studies), social interactions (25 studies), services (1 study), movement (3 studies), surveillance (9 studies) and response (7 studies). Nine studies evaluated the combined effect of multiple measures. The main consequences assessed were from the categories health and well-being (29 studies), acceptability and adherence (31 studies), and social and institutional (23 studies). Fewer studies covered consequences from the categories equality and equity (2 studies), economic and resource (7 studies), and ecological (1 study). No studies examined consequences for the health system and social welfare services or for human and fundamental rights.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nThis scoping review provides an overview of the evidence on the unintended consequences of PHSM implemented in the school setting to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2. The 60 included studies describe a broad body of evidence and cover a range of measures and unintended consequences, primarily consequences for health and well-being, acceptability and adherence, social and institutional aspects, and economic aspects. The main gaps identified relate to consequences of school measures for the health system and social welfare services, human and fundamental rights, equality and equity, and the environment. Further research is needed to fill these gaps, making use of diverse methodological approaches. Future studies should explore unintended consequences - whether beneficial or harmful - in more depth and over longer time periods, in different population groups, and across different contexts. A more robust evidence base could inform and facilitate decisions about whether, how, and when to implement or terminate COVID-19 risk mitigation measures in school settings, and how to counter negative unintended consequences.\n\n\nFUNDING\nThis publication was partially funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) within the Network of University Medicine (NUM) 1.0, Grant No. 01KX2021 in the context of the project CEOsys, and NUM 2.0, Grant No. 01KX2121 in the context of the projects PREPARED and coverCHILD.\n\n\nREGISTRATION\nThe protocol is registered on the Open Science Framework (osf.io/bsxh8).

Meanwhile, the results of handling violations in the 2019 simultaneous elections increased sharply to 21,169 cases, or an increase of 58.3% from 2014. This was due to the material on Indonesia's general election regulations, which overlapped and were not in harmony with the Constitution and judges' decisions. This research aims to analyze the issues surrounding simultaneous general elections in Indonesia and outline alternative progressive policies for achieving democratic governance with dignity and integrity during the next general election. This research focuses on normative law, utilizing statutory and conceptual approaches that pertain to democracy, elections, and various types of violations. To get an overview of the new policy, this research compares the handling of election violations in Indonesia with that in Sweden. The research results show violations of the general election administration, the code of ethics for election organizers, election crimes, and other legal violations in Indonesia and Sweden. However, Sweden still maintains its democratic stability. Several election manipulation factors that become fraud or violations are the manipulation of election rules, the manipulation of vote conditioning in the form of money politics, the updating of voter lists, and the conditioning of candidate requirements to cyberattacks. Therefore, it is crucial for regulations, participants, and the voting public to reevaluate the integrity of elections.\n\n\n\n", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2024-06-27", "synthetic_support_claim": "Violations in Indonesia's 2019 simultaneous elections increased sharply to 21,169 cases, a 58.3% rise.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Sweden's election system is more effective than Indonesia's system in preventing all forms of election violations."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "1d2485c371deba065cd9b26f6dbd16e569afee41", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1d2485c371deba065cd9b26f6dbd16e569afee41", "title": "Modernizing Divorce in Courts: How to Realize Justice in Diverse Geographical Conditions?", "abstract": "The modernization of Islamic family law requires divorce to be carried out in court. However, it causes problems of injustice in its implementation, especially for some people in Central Kalimantan Province. For example, a wide geographical condition makes the location of the court and the community not always easy to reach, which makes it difficult for people to propose and administer divorce through the court. The study aimed to analyze how to realize divorce justice in court in diverse geographical conditions. The study was a juridical-empirical legal study with analysis using the theory of legal objectives and maslahah. The findings showed that divorce in court in its implementation causes injustice, especially in Central Kalimantan Province, due to geographical conditions that make it difficult for people to access the court. The wide area and far distance, and the condition of terrain (broken road) in some areas make the community fall into a dilemma. They must choose the least mudharat (disadvantage/harm).

Despite the rapid development and widespread access to the COVID-19 vaccine, herd immunity is yet to be achieved, with vaccine hesitancy as a major barrier. This study sought to systematically assess the beliefs, attitudes, and acceptance towards COVID-19 vaccines, including factors contributing to vaccination hesitancy in the Eastern and Western Hemispheres. A comprehensive search of articles was conducted through Scopus, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Web of Science databases for studies published from inception to May 2023 using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.

Overall, vaccine acceptance was low to moderate in the general population and healthcare workers (HCWs) in both Eastern and Western Hemispheres except for China which reported high acceptance (defined as >75%) among the general population and HCWs. Demographic characteristics (female, younger age, and higher education) and non-demographic factors (knowledge about the COVID-19 vaccine and its development, history of influenza vaccination, perceived susceptibility or severity of infection, and the belief that vaccines are effective in controlling the pandemic) were associated with high acceptance rates or intentions to take the COVID-19 vaccine. On the other hand, mistrust of the vaccine, its safety and effectiveness, disinformation or poor awareness of the vaccine, side effect concerns, belief in natural immunity, previous adverse experience with the vaccines, and distrust in the information sources about the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with vaccination hesitancy.

Design Cross-sectional study. Setting Lahore, the second largest metropolis in Pakistan. Participants This study was conducted among parents residing in Lahore from March to April 2023. Participants were recruited via convenience sampling. Outcome measures Data were collected using a prevalidated questionnaire that consisted of four sections: (1) informed consent, (2) demographic details, (3) COVID-19 vaccine uptake in children aged 5\u201317 years, parents\u2019 experience with childhood COVID-19 vaccination and their intention to vaccinate their unvaccinated children and (4) a modified 5C scale tailored to determine parents\u2019 confidence, complacency, constraints, calculation and collective responsibility with regard to COVID-19 vaccination. Results This study included 414 parents (median age=37 years; mothers=62%). COVID-19 vaccination rates for children in the age groups 12\u201317 years and 5\u201311 years were 72.5% and 30.1%, respectively. Transient adverse events following immunisation were reported by 32.7% of parents. Of parents with unvaccinated children aged 12\u201317\u2009years, only 35% intended to vaccinate them. The majority of parents were not willing to vaccinate their children below 11 years of age. Parents with a self-reported positive history of COVID-19 disease (OR=2.531, p=0.016), and confident in the vaccine\u2019s safety and efficacy (OR=1.968, p=0.010), were more inclined to vaccinate their 5\u201311\u2009years. In terms of vaccination of children below 5 years, confidence in the vaccine (OR=2.942, p=0.003) and a sense of collective responsibility were positive predictors (OR=2.260, p=0.035), while calculation was identified as a negative predictor of parents\u2019 intention to vaccinate their under 5 years (OR=0.421, p=0.018). Conclusion CVH was significantly higher among parents of children aged 5\u201311\u2009years and children younger than 5 years old.

Hence, this study aims to advance the existing literature by focusing on the interplay between institutional and firm governance mechanisms for greater ESG engagement. More specifically, the authors investigate whether public governance stimulates excessive ESG engagement and whether corporate governance moderates this relationship.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nUsing a sample of 43,803 firm-year observations affiliated with 41 countries and 9 industries, the authors adopt a country, industry and year fixed-effects regression analysis.\n\n\nFindings\nThe authors find that public governance strength via its six dimensions stimulates excessive ESG engagement. This implies that firms in countries with strong voice and accountability, political stability, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law and control of corruption are more motivated for ESG engagement. Furthermore, corporate governance negatively moderates the relationship between all public governance dimensions (except political stability) and excessive ESG engagement. This implies that public governance and corporate governance are substitutes for encouraging firms to commit to ESG. Further tests reveal that whereas these results in the baseline analyses are valid for developed countries, they are not valid in emerging markets.\n\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nThe findings support the interplay between institutional and agency theories. In countries with strong (weak) institutional mechanisms, corporate governance becomes weak (strong) in inciting greater stakeholder engagement. This implies that the public governance mechanism alleviates agency costs, rendering internal mechanisms of corporate governance noncompulsory for ESG engagement.\n\n\nPractical implications\nThe findings suggest that emerging countries need to reinforce their institutions for greater accountability, regulatory quality and control of corruption, which will have a domino effect on firms in addressing stakeholder expectations. The results also advise emerging country firms to augment their internal monitoring mechanisms for greater stakeholder engagement, such as structuring boards and establishing corporate social responsibility mechanisms, committees and policies.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThis study contributes to the recent literature investigating the role of corporate governance mechanisms in excessive ESG engagement.

While the Code claims to democratise, decolonise and consolidate Indonesian criminal law, this article demonstrates that it has achieved the opposite. It undermines democracy by seriously hampering free speech, including legitimate criticism of government officeholders and institutions. It reinstates offences imposed during the Dutch colonial era that were used against Indonesian nationalists pushing for independence, including Indonesia\u2019s first president, Soekarno. And, far from bringing together Indonesia\u2019s disparate regulatory sources of criminal law, the Code adds another layer of law to existing sui generis criminal statutes, which largely remain in effect. Worse, the new Code imposes conservative religious-based values allowing the state to interfere in citizens\u2019 private sexual lives.

The scale of pandemic and war in Ukraine was not fully forecasted, but the crisis phenomena of these disasters have specific signs. One of the priorities of the tax and budget policy is resilience to threats, both foreseeable and unforeseeable. Problem Statement. The full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine has led to significant changes in the resource base, economic potential and the common system of public finances, these can no longer function on pre-war principles. New realities, both internal and external, have emerged; it is impossible to ensure the successful development of the state without scientific understanding of them. Purpose. Justification of directions for the formation of internal pillars of stability and security of the economic development of Ukraine through transformations in Public Financial Management (PFM) during the period of martial law and post-war reconstruction. Methods. Based on trends in statistical indicators, a comparative analysis of national anti-crisis reforms in the field of public finances was conducted. The methodology of the system approach, methods of factual, situational analysis and synthesis were used. Results. Ukraine's acquisition of the status of a candidate for the EU membership, the modern realities of statehood and national economy recovery amid when the signs of fundamental turmoil in the global economic space, require significant changes in the PFM. It is necessary to rethink from scientific perspective and adjust the policy of countering threats of global and regional economic and social contradictions. International discussions on the plans for the post-war reconstruction of Ukraine prove the still uncertain, extremely multidimensional picture of the development of various components of the national socio-economic system. The amount of external financial support will depend on whether the measures to improve PFM during the period of martial law, as well as post-war reconstruction, will be interconnected, subordinated according to the space-time vector, etc. Conclusions. International financial institutions provide resources to conflict-prone and fragile states not only to correct imbalances, but also to build confidence during crisis situations when countries risk losing their ability to borrow on open markets.

Overcoming the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and full-scale Russian aggression against Ukraine caused the destruction of a stable system of managing financial flows not only in our country, but also in many states. Market and regulatory mechanisms for mobilization and the use of financial resources were undermined. Fiscal consolidation measures were changed in favor of expansion. The need to increase the resource base on the basis of state debt has intensified. The use of standardized approaches in the field of fiscal policy did not make it possible to limit risks under new conditions. The task of implementing new conceptual approaches to the management of public budget financing based on the use of debt instruments has arisen. Problem Statement. An increase in debt financing of public budgets helps to expand the volume of resources for the implementation of state plans. At the same time, the pressure on the financial system is growing, which requires making significant changes to the formation of the structure of debt instruments, their placement on domestic and foreign financial markets, attraction of resources on preferential terms from foreign partners, fulfillment of repayment and servicing obligations, refinancing and restructuring of loans. Determining rational management decisions on these issues involves the development of a conceptual framework for public debt financing. The purpose is to study the formation of a conceptual framework for managing debt financing of public budgets and their use in the practice of public administration. Methods. Research methods are used: historical, logical, abstraction, description, generalization, comparison, grouping, analysis and synthesis. Results. The adoption of the debt framework guides the definition of debt strategy, debt management goals, indicators of its volume and structure, debt management tasks, as well as mechanisms and tools for their implementation. The debt strategy reflects the orientation of the debt policy, the goals of public debt management for long and medium-term periods, its indicators, the use of tools and mechanisms for achieving the adopted goals, the formation of the debt portfolio for the specified terms, the classification of risks of government debt management taking into account their impact on the performance of state budget, the application of refinancing and restructuring mechanisms for state liabilities. Conclusions. The conceptual framework for managing debt financing of public budget is an important guiding document aimed at taking into account the conditions for placing debt obligations among investors (state institutions, non-state depositors, non-residents), access to international financial markets, cooperation with international organizations and financial institutions, acceptance of debt portfolio (the structure of state budget financing), built according to types of debt instruments, sources of financing, currencies of loan repayment and servicing, repayment terms, loan servicing rates and debt refinancing. The development and implementation of the conceptual framework for the management of public debt transactions is important for Ukraine. In the conditions of overcoming the consequences of the war and post-war reconstruction, it is necessary to apply a comprehensive approach to the formation, distribution and use of resources raised on the basis of the use of public debt instruments.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-11-04", "synthetic_support_claim": "The development of a conceptual framework for managing debt financing of public budgets is crucial.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Increasing state debt always leads to economic growth."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "d74dfe34c346f5a797bef46581291e2fab08a9ee", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d74dfe34c346f5a797bef46581291e2fab08a9ee", "title": "Management of budget expenditures in wartime", "abstract": "Introduction. In conditions of martial law, the role and importance of budget expenditures in solving the problems of a warring country increases. After all, expenditures on the country's defense determine the degree of resistance to the aggressor, the completeness of providing the needs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in ammunition, modern combat equipment, FPV drones and other technological weapons.\n\nProblem Statement. In conditions of martial law, as in peacetime, the key task of the budget system is to increase its efficiency, including through transparency, accountability, promoting innovation and investment attractiveness, sustainability of public finances, etc. This can be achieved by fulfilling a number of important scientific and practical tasks, including optimization of budget expenditures, effective allocation of funds, prioritization of budget programs, investment projects, targeted use, as well as timeliness and completeness of financing in order to achieve the predicted final result.\n\nThe purpose is an analytical assessment of changes in the management of state budget expenditures during the war and the development of mechanisms for increasing their effectiveness while maintaining financial stability.\n\nMethods. General scientific and special methods were used: comparative analysis, synthesis, grouping, description, tabular method, theoretical generalization and abstract-logical.\n\nResults. The budget legislation on the management of budget expenditures, which is applied in peacetime and under martial law, was analyzed. The dynamics of the growth of the share of State Budget expenditures and, accordingly, the decrease in the share of local budgets in the overall structure of expenditures of the consolidated budget of Ukraine were highlighted. The dynamics of the consolidated budget were analyzed by functional classification and the priorities of budget expenditures were established in peacetime, as well as during the period of full-scale Russian invasion. The reasons for the emergence of such a permanent phenomenon for the domestic budget system as a budget deficit were indicated. The emergence of a deficit in wartime and the forced need to increase Ukraine's military-industrial potential in order to stop the aggressor are substantiated. A mechanism for improving approaches to managing defense budget expenditures is proposed.\n\nConclusions. It is important to effectively manage budget expenditures both in peacetime and in martial law to meet urgent public needs. The priorities of budget expenditures in peacetime are significantly different from the needs of a warring country: these now include ensuring the financing of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the security sector in general, as well as maintaining a balance between financing military needs and social protection of the population. The relevance of the problem of finding sources of covering the budget deficit has increased, since the war has not only exacerbated chronic problems, but also brought new challenges associated with external shocks and threats, in particular, the lack of access to external financial markets. In such a situation, the burden on the budget system increases significantly. Currently, the Government of Ukraine has managed to avoid default, so the situation is under control and requires efforts to introduce efficient mechanisms for effective management of budget expenditures, which will have a positive impact on the recovery of public finances and guarantee long-term macro-financial stability.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-12-28", "synthetic_support_claim": "The war has shifted Ukraine's budget priorities to defense and social protection, highlighting budget deficit challenges.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Ukraine's budget deficit during wartime can be effectively resolved solely through domestic fiscal policy adjustments."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "aa88e4c42733fc6a3a818505f9b8be37a18f5d08", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/aa88e4c42733fc6a3a818505f9b8be37a18f5d08", "title": "The shifting issue content of left\u2013right identification: cohort differences in Western Europe", "abstract": "Abstract Over the last decades, the rising salience of new issues has transformed politics in Western Europe.

Through three cases, namely, non-human inhabitation of an iconic infrastructure, routine infrastructural work in the form of street cleaning, and transformational repairs that support the use of buildings by breeding birds, the paper argues that undertaking maintenance as a form of compromise not only allows for messy co-presence, but demonstrates an understanding of infrastructure that takes the lifeworlds of non-humans seriously. However, while such a coming to terms indicates a shift in the politics of knowledge, attending to the collective life of infrastructure reveals the simultaneous constraints and tensions that make radical propositions for alternative futures difficult to imagine. The paper thus concludes by underlining the complex motivations that shape practices of repair and maintenance in the multispecies city, the problem with taking such works as a sign of shifting ethical relations, and the expertise and unknowns that are involved in responding to non-human inhabitations of infrastructure.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-12-15", "synthetic_support_claim": "\"Maintenance as compromise reflects an adjustment to new ecological proximities in urban infrastructures.\"", "synthetic_refute_claim": "The kittiwake populations are primarily responsible for urban infrastructure damage in UK towns and cities."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "9ecd069e38d0b6ab4aab65a3b56a3a2f6b50e409", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9ecd069e38d0b6ab4aab65a3b56a3a2f6b50e409", "title": "Framing the Israel-Palestine conflict 2021: Investigation of CNN\u2019s coverage from a peace journalism perspective", "abstract": "This study uses textual analysis to examine CNN\u2019s World News coverage of the 12-day conflict between Israel and Palestine in May 2021.

Such technology can significantly support academics and students by automating monotonous tasks and making personalised suggestions. However, despite the potential of the technology, there are significant concerns regarding AI misuse, particularly by students in assessments. There are two schools of thought: one advocates for a complete ban on it, while the other views it as a valuable educational tool, provided it is governed by a robust usage policy. This contradiction clearly indicates a major policy gap in academic practices, and new policies are required to uphold academic standards while enabling staff and students to benefit from technological advancements. We surveyed 117 academics from three countries (UK, UAE, and Iraq), and identified that most academics retain positive opinions regarding AI in education. For example, the majority of experienced academics do not favour complete bans, and they see the potential benefits of AI for students, teaching staff, and academic institutions. Importantly, academics specifically identified the particular benefits of AI for autonomous assessment (71.79% of respondents agreed). Therefore, for the first time, we propose a novel AI framework for autonomously evaluating students' work (e.g., reports, coursework, etc.) and automatically assigning grades based on their knowledge and in-depth understanding of the submitted content.

We evaluated California's Armed and Prohibited Persons System (APPS), which identifies legal purchasers of firearms who have become prohibited persons and seeks to recover all firearms and ammunition to which they have access.\n\n\nDESIGN AND METHODS\nThis cluster-randomised pragmatic trial was made possible by APPS's expansion from a small pilot to a continuing statewide programme. We included 363 California cities, allocated to early (n=187) or later (n=176) intervention in blocks stratified by region within the state, and within region by population and violent crime rate. The study period began 1 February 2015; region-specific end dates ranged from 1 May 2015 to 1 February 2016. Analysis was on an intention-to-treat, difference-in-difference basis using generalised linear mixed models and generalised estimating equations with robust SEs. The population-level primary outcome measures were monthly city-level counts of firearm-related homicides, robberies and aggravated assaults. The primary model was adjusted for stratification variables; city-level population, population density, socioeconomic status and firearm purchasing; year; and month.\n\n\nFINDINGS\nAllocation groups were well balanced on baseline characteristics and implementation measures. In adjusted models, allocation to early intervention was not associated with statistically significant differences in any primary outcome measure; these findings were robust to multiple sensitivity analyses.

The study assessed how water harvesting techniques contribute to improved water efficiency and agricultural productivity, while also examining the role of value addition in ensuring sustainability. Using a descriptive research design, the sample size for the study comprised of 25 farmers and 34 agricultural extension officers and county government officials. Data was collected using both structured questionnaire and Key Informant Interviews (KII). Quantitative data collected from farmers was analyzed with the aid of SPSS using both descriptive statistics and inferential analysis to assess effect of level of adoption of innovative water harvesting techniques on improvement in water efficiency and agricultural sustainability. The qualitative data collected was analyzed thematically through content analysis. The study's findings, were presented on tables and narrative form, giving analysis of the current state of water harvesting and value addition practices and their role in agricultural sustainability.

Leveraging the TruthSeeker dataset, which includes a diverse set of labeled news articles and social media posts spanning over a decade, we evaluated the performance of classifiers such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Our analysis demonstrates that SVMs using TF-IDF embeddings and CNNs employing TF-IDF embeddings achieve the highest overall performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These results suggest that TF-IDF, with its capacity to highlight discriminative features in text, enhances the performance of models like SVMs, which are adept at handling sparse data representations. Additionally, CNNs benefit from TF-IDF by effectively capturing localized features and patterns within the textual data. In contrast, while Word2Vec and FastText embeddings capture semantic and syntactic nuances, they introduce complexities that may not always benefit traditional ML models like MLPs or SVMs, which could explain their relatively lower performance in some cases.

Therefore, the coverage of targets (CoT) maximization should be the primary objective of mobile charger scheduling.

Traditional forensic infrastructure and in vivo rodent models often have significant limitations due to high costs and ethical concerns. As a result, zebrafish (Danio rerio) are gaining popularity as an attractive alternative model for LMICs because of their cost-effectiveness and practical advantages. Zebrafish have a lower acquisition cost, require less demanding husbandry, and have rapid development cycles, all of which facilitate faster and more economical toxicological studies, even in limited laboratory space. Additionally, the optical transparency of zebrafish embryos and larvae allows for non-invasive in vivo observations, reducing the need for extra resources. Research has shown that zebrafish can effectively investigate the behavioral, developmental, and cardiotoxic effects of various novel psychoactive substances (NPSs), including synthetic opioids, cathinones, and hallucinogens. They also excel in metabolic profiling, producing a broader range of metabolites than other models, with significant overlap in human metabolism. The presence of mammalian-like metabolic enzymes further positions zebrafish as a valuable tool for understanding human NPS metabolism and predicting potential effects. Notably, they can identify metabolites that traditional models may not detect, underscoring their potential for novel metabolite discovery. Despite these advantages, standardizing data collection protocols and addressing interlaboratory variability are crucial challenges that must be overcome for the widespread adoption of the zebrafish model. However, ongoing global efforts are paving the way to address these limitations and ensure the successful integration of zebrafish models into the field of forensic toxicology.

We model recruitment, state incapacitation, conflict, and saturation as sources of cartel size variation. Results show that by 2022, cartels counted 160,000 to 185,000 units, becoming one of the country\u2019s top employers.

This focus misses large parts of online activities of a majority of politically disinterested citizens. Although political content also appears outside of news outlets and may profoundly shape public opinion, its prevalence and effects are under-studied at scale. This project combines three-wave panel survey data from three countries (total N = 7,266) with online behavioral data from the same participants (over 106M visits). We create a multi-lingual classifier to identify political content both in news and outside (e.g. in shopping or entertainment sites). We find that news consumption is infrequent: just 3.4% of participants\u2019 online browsing comprised visits to news sites. Only between 14% (NL) and 36% (US) of these visits were to news about politics. The overwhelming majority of participants' visits were to non-news sites. Although only 1.6\\% of those visits related to politics, in absolute terms, citizens encounter politics more frequently outside of news than within news. Out of every 10 visits to political content, 3.4 come from news and 6.6 from non-news sites. Furthermore, exposure to political content outside news domains had the same \u2013 and in some cases stronger - associations with key democratic attitudes and behaviors as news exposure.

However, qualitative audience research increasingly shows that this approach does not match the reality of citizens anymore \u2013 news has become a much more fluid, fragmented concept than just what has been produced by journalists. Not accounting for these changes means that researchers are missing out on important sources of political information, potentially leading to biased estimates of exposure. This is especially true in the area of digital trace studies in which researchers are faced with an abundance of detailed data but so far mostly limited their analyses to lists of popular news outlets to research political information exposure. The aim of this paper is threefold: Conceptually, we propose to combine existing conceptualizations of news into a taxonomy of news. Methodologically, we apply this taxonomy to classify domains in digital trace data of Dutch users, showing its applicability to study changes in information environments on a larger, quantitative scale. Empirically, we show the extent to which a focus on general interest newsroom journalism leads to distortions and blind spots in news diversity research. Our results show that there is much to be found when zooming in on the long tail of news, outside of larger newsroom journalism sources.

Attention is focused on the problem of human resource management during a crisis. Based on the analysis of publications by Ukrainian scholars, the article discusses challenges faced by academic staff and students of Ukrainian universities in the context of war. The higher education institutions that were temporarily displaced from Luhansk and Donetsk regions twice in 2014 and 2022 were analyzed in a particular way as the educational institutions that were affected by negative factors for the longest time and were most affected by the war. The dynamics of changes in the number of students and the number of research and teaching staff were studied. The dynamics of changes in the number of full-time employees in public HEIs of the first wave of displacement is compared with the data on HEIs located near the combat zone.

This phenomenon of food-discarding behavior is also observed in developing nations, including Indonesia. This study aims to compare three behavioral models in mitigating food-discarding behavior, namely the theory of planned behavior, the norm activation model, and the value-belief-norm theory.\n\u00a0\nTheoretical Framework: This study involves 9 behavioral constructs from the theory of planned behavior, the Norm Activation Model, and the Value-Belief-Norm theory to mitigate food-wasting behavior.\n\u00a0\nMethod: The research participants were drawn from Makassar City, Indonesia, comprising a total of 1715 respondents, with data collected using a Likert-scale behavioral assessment.

Second, in the TPB model, perceived behavioral control had a more direct impact on reducing food waste than behavioral intention, while attitude had the strongest influence on intention. Intention also mediated the relationship between attitude and food waste behavior. Third, in the NAM, ascription of responsibility had the greatest direct effect on personal norms, and personal norms mediated the impacts of all predictors, with the strongest mediation occurring between ascription of responsibility and decreased food waste. Fourth, the VBN model demonstrated that ascription of responsibility had the highest direct influence on personal norms, and values and\u00a0could reduce food waste through the mediation of other constructs in the model.\n\u00a0\nResearch Implications: to effectively mitigate food-wasting behavior among individuals, intervention programs must be implemented to enhance attitudes, social norms, perceived behavioral control, awareness of consequences, the ascription of responsibility, subjective norms, and values.\n\u00a0\nOriginality/Value: The results of this study have shown direct comparative results between TPB, NAM, and VBN, and the uniqueness of each behavioral model in reducing food-wasting behavior, especially in developing countries.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-11-25", "synthetic_support_claim": "Perceived behavioral control directly impacts reducing food waste more than behavioral intention in the TPB model.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "The TPB model's perceived behavioral control has no impact on food-wasting behavior in developing countries."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "2a6ea58df392ce9eca572c9858ac4b1177ed1cbf", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2a6ea58df392ce9eca572c9858ac4b1177ed1cbf", "title": "Food Wastage, a Threat to Indonesian Tourism", "abstract": "The tourism sector have the impact to environmental as it shifts towards sustainable tourism development.

These diseases, which make up about 70% of all new and existing diseases, are increasingly interconnected with factors like the environment, society, and economics. The term \u201czoonoses\u201d is discussed beyond just veterinary medicine, emphasizing its complex nature influenced by human activities and climate change. Bioethical principles and strategies for preventing these diseases are proposed. A case study on animal slaughter during disasters highlights ethical challenges in how we manage health across species, leading to discussions on \u201czoonoethics\u201d. The paper also explores how these diseases emerge and the ethical and political issues around antimicrobial resistance (AMR), with recommendations for tackling AMR. The management of these diseases will require the adoption and acceleration of the \u201cOne Health\u201d approach, which recognizes the interconnectedness and interdependence between human, animal, and environmental health. Abstract This paper presents a critical review of key issues related to the emergence of new networks for the spread of zoonotic diseases amid the mass extinction of species. Zoonotic and infectious diseases account for approximately 70% of new and existing diseases affecting humans and animals. The initial section argues that the term \u201czoonoses\u201d should not be confined to single-cause events within veterinary medicine. Instead, zoonoses should be viewed as complex, systemic phenomena shaped by interrelated factors, including environmental, sociocultural, and economic elements, influenced by anthropogenic climate change. The second section presents bioethical principles and potential strategies for those engaged in zoonotic disease prevention. The third section uses the slaughter of animals in disaster settings as a case study to illustrate the need for further clarification of normative and interspecies justice conflicts in One Health ethics. This section concludes with an outlook on \u201czoonoethics\u201d. Section four develops the analysis of the interlinked elements that trigger zoonoses and examines antimicrobial resistance (AMR) from an ethical and political standpoint, concluding with policy recommendations for addressing AMR. Section five offers a critical reflection, integrating contributions from zoonoethics, human ecology, and the ecotheological turn.

Politics was a realm of distinctively human endeavors, while nonhuman nature remained outside. Nature might impinge on or set limits to political action, but was conceived as constitutively outside of politics. However else nonhuman entities might engage with humans or each other, these relations or engagements were not understood as political. Until quite recently, Western political theory was decidedly anthropocentric. The rise of environmental problematics, and particularly the political salience of the global climate crisis, however, have made the idea of a constitutive separation between (nonhuman) nature and (human) politics less tenable. Not only the material manipulation of the nonhuman world, but also its conceptual framing, are increasingly understood as political projects.1 At the same time, Western political thought has become increasingly open to non-Western cosmologies that do not posit a rigid divide between human and non- (or more-than-) human worlds. Environmental (or green) political theory has become an increasingly robust subdiscipline,2 and political theory, like a number of other humanities disciplines, has undergone an \u201canimal turn.\u201d3 Three of the four recent books under consideration form part of this latter animal turn while Sharon Krause\u2019s Eco-Emancipation is firmly situated in the field of environmental political theory.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2025-01-15", "synthetic_support_claim": "The global climate crisis challenges the traditional anthropocentric separation between human politics and nonhuman nature.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Nonhuman animals can possess political agency independent of human recognition or interaction."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "fa8e534a6adfe92fcec605ab0f9e3cdb28a6b90f", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fa8e534a6adfe92fcec605ab0f9e3cdb28a6b90f", "title": "China's renewable energy and energy efficiency policies toward carbon neutrality: A systematic cross-sectoral review", "abstract": "The ambitious targets of peaking CO2 emissions before 2030 and reaching carbon neutrality before 2060 (Goal 3060) have emerged as the driving force in the development of China's low-carbon energy policy.

It ranks as the 8th largest exporter in the world, however, pesticide use associated with the agriculture is ranked 18th in the world and 5th in Asia. Previous studies have clearly stated that pesticides are a threat to human health and the environment. The government is now making efforts to address pesticide use and the health impacts of pesticide use, however, these efforts are still in need of completion. This paper aims to summarize: (1) the current situation with regard to pesticide use in Thailand; (2) the current situation with regard to pesticide poisoning in Thailand; and (3) important role of government in reducing pesticide use and risk sustainably in Thailand: current situation and recommendations. This article suggests that government is a significant driver for reducing pesticide use and risk sustainably and the establishment of push and pull policies, legislation, and strategies. The government needs to strictly adhere to international conventions. Introducing a pesticide tax is essential to reduce redundant pesticide use. Updating of the current act, specific regulations with regard to pesticides and strict enforcement are urgently required. Licensing pesticide applicators should be implemented continuously. Promotion of alternative pest management is needed by supportive production inputs, technology, and markets as well as the development of a monitoring and certification system. Educating consumers on how to choose safe agricultural products and reduce risk from pesticide residues in the products is also necessary. All approaches should be implemented simultaneously and instantly.

This paper examines the ecological and public health ramifications of these residues, highlighting the urgent need for sustainable agricultural practices, targeted public health initiatives, and policy reforms aimed at reducing the risks posed by pesticide exposure. The paper found that soil contamination from pesticide residues disrupts microbial ecosystems, compromises soil health, and leads to water pollution, ultimately contributing to biodiversity loss. Pesticide exposure, whether through direct contact or contaminated food, poses significant risks to farm workers and consumers. Public health strategies such as Integrated Pest Management (IPM) and biological control methods offer sustainable alternatives that help reduce dependency on chemical pesticides. Adopting organic farming methods, enhancing public knowledge of the safe use of pesticides, and providing comprehensive education on related risks are key strategies for reducing exposure and ensuring public health protection. Collaboration among stakeholders, including policy makers, farmers, industry leaders, and consumers, is essential for building a safer and more sustainable agricultural system. Additionally, bridging research gaps\u2014particularly those related to the long-term health effects of pesticide exposure and the development of safer alternatives\u2014is crucial for guiding informed policy decisions. As the global demand for safer food continues to increase, cohesive and strategic efforts are imperative to establish a resilient food production system that emphasizes environmental sustainability and human health.

Despite the growing body of literature on smart contracts and the sharing economy, there remains a gap in understanding how these two areas intersect and what implications this could have on sustainability. By reviewing existing literature, analyzing real-world applications of smart contracts within sharing economy platforms and creating a model to quantitatively describe the effect, this study seeks to provide insights into this emerging area of research.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThis study uses a mixed-methods approach to investigate the impact of smart contracts on the sharing economy through the lens of car-sharing company Delimobil. Initially, a literature review was conducted to conceptualize the sharing economy and smart contract technologies. The proposed generalized business model of a sharing economy company was analyzed to identify attributes amenable to smart contract implementation. Qualitative analysis assessed the effects of smart contracts on these attributes. Subsequently, a quantitative revenue and costs models for the car-sharing company were developed, comparing profit margins before and after smart contract adoption. The costs of maintaining smart contracts in the Delimobil company were also evaluated for a comprehensive cost\u2013benefit analysis.\n\n\nFindings\nSmart contracts can enhance the efficiency of governance models, mediating interfaces, review systems, revenue streams and pricing mechanisms through automation, security and transparency. This study\u2019s quantitative model, based on Delimobil\u2019s case, shows that smart contracts could increase revenue by 9.7% and reduce costs by 8.13%, while raising IT infrastructure costs from 301m RUB to 484m RUB. Delimobil\u2019s profit could rise from 6,463m RUB to 9,478m RUB. While this demonstrates the potential of smart contracts in car-sharing, the lack of quantitative data and novelty of the technology present challenges for further research.\n\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nThis study\u2019s limitations include its focus on a single case study (Delimobil) in the car-sharing industry, which may not be applicable to all sharing economy sectors. Additionally, the static assumption of regulatory and technological environments may not account for future changes that could affect the feasibility of smart contracts. The lack of quantitative research in this field also presents challenges for advancing further studies.\n\n\nPractical implications\nFor practitioners, this research provides a comprehensive view of the pros and cons of implementing smart contracts in car-sharing, based on a detailed revenue and cost model. This analysis, using Delimobil as a case study, shows that smart contracts can increase revenue by 9.7% and reduce costs by 8.13%, although IT infrastructure costs rise from 301m RUB to 484m RUB. This leads to a potential profit increase from 6,463m RUB to 9,478m RUB. Despite the potential benefits, the lack of quantitative data and the novelty of the technology present challenges for further exploration.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThis paper presents an innovative exploration of the intersection between smart contracts and the sharing economy, addressing a significant gap in existing literature. By combining qualitative and quantitative analyses, it offers a comprehensive evaluation of how smart contracts can enhance efficiency, transparency and trust within sharing economy platforms. The study\u2019s mixed-methods approach and detailed cost\u2013benefit analysis of implementing smart contracts in the car-sharing industry provide unique insights and practical recommendations. This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on blockchain technology\u2019s potential to revolutionize business models in the sharing economy, offering a foundation for future investigations.\n", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2024-12-02", "synthetic_support_claim": "Smart contracts can increase a car-sharing company's revenue by 9.7% and reduce costs by 8.13%.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Smart contracts significantly decrease the environmental impact of car-sharing services by reducing carbon emissions."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "d553b5919832ad3a22ed1d1acfaaa1b47f10c929", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d553b5919832ad3a22ed1d1acfaaa1b47f10c929", "title": "Sustained Harm Over Time and Space Limits the External Function of Online Counterpublics for American Muslims", "abstract": "Social media platforms are celebrated for their capacity to empower those with marginalized or disenfranchised identities and support them to create counterpublics.

Though the adoption of net zero targets has created optimism in the climate regime, there remain significant concerns that it is little more than a vague aspiration. Studies have focused on various net zero definitions, as well as the adoption and robustness of net zero goals. This paper builds on these works by conducting a systematic meta-review of scholarly research on net zero from 1991 to 2021. First, we find that the literature focuses on establishing pathways and creating policies, with much less research on target-setting and implementation. Second, most net zero scholarship focuses on the energy sector, including buildings, while hard to abate sectors are underexamined. Third, there is a disproportionate focus on creating policies for net zero buildings, which are relatively easy to measure and decarbonize compared to other sectors. Finally, there is a notable absence of work on the political factors that enable or constrain the implementation of net zero policies, as well as the efficacy of these policies. This indicates an urgent need for more research on the politics of net zero. Key policy insights Existing scholarly research focuses primarily on the science of net zero, setting goals and translating those goals to emissions pathways. Substantively, the majority of scholarship is focused on energy \u2013 including buildings, transportation and power generation. There is a need for more research on other, often hard-to-abate sectors such as industrial processes, manufacturing and construction, agriculture and waste. More scholarly research on net zero is also needed to evaluate existing policies, both to understand which ones contribute to decarbonization (and not simply emissions reductions), and under what conditions. There is an urgent need for greater understanding about the political conditions which promote or constrain the creation and implementation of net zero policies across sectors. Without filling these research gaps, policymakers may struggle to design and implement effective net zero policies.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-06-01", "synthetic_support_claim": "There is a disproportionate focus on creating policies for net zero buildings in scholarly research.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Net zero targets will unequivocally achieve significant global warming mitigation by 2050 without addressing political challenges."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "d966d7b17c29b36f56110b7ea8d3f2b38ddfc29e", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d966d7b17c29b36f56110b7ea8d3f2b38ddfc29e", "title": "Who are the green transition experts? Towards a new research agenda on climate change knowledge", "abstract": "Experts play a significant role in shaping global and local norms on how societies should respond to the climate crisis. However, current scholarship on the relationship between expertise and climate change has not fully addressed recent transformations in the field, specifically the emergence and increasingly influential role of what we term \u201cgreen transition expertise.\u201d We define green transition expertise as a more applied, normative, and contextual form of climate change knowledge that is contrasted with the formalized, pure science of \u201cclimate expertise.\u201d If climate experts assess the deteriorating state of the global climate, then transition experts tell states and corporations what they should do about it. We argue that if the social science of climate change knowledge is to further deepen its grasp of the politics of the green transition analytically and normatively, it must embrace a \u201cpost\u2010IPCC\u201d research agenda that turns increasingly toward studying the power of transition experts in directing state and corporate climate action. Based on a review of the literature, we contrast the extant IPCC agenda with an emerging post\u2010IPCC agenda along three dimensions: expert cast (who are the experts?), expert content (what do they know?) and expert context (where are they located?). By marking a shift in each of these dimensions, the post\u2010IPCC agenda sensitizes the social science of climate change knowledge to overlooked and increasingly powerful forms of experts and expertise. To facilitate their study, we define six specific areas that require detailed attention as the post\u2010IPCC agenda develops.This article is categorized under:\nThe Social Status of Climate Change Knowledge > Sociology/Anthropology of Climate Knowledge\nPolicy and Governance > National Climate Change Policy\nClimate, History, Society, Culture > Ideas and Knowledge\n", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2024-09-05", "synthetic_support_claim": "The post-IPCC agenda emphasizes the influential role of transition experts in directing climate action.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Transition experts always align with state and corporate interests, neglecting broader societal or environmental considerations."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "c8a1aa4e25ddb7d9c7b855cf177a378c6e309536", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c8a1aa4e25ddb7d9c7b855cf177a378c6e309536", "title": "Net Zero is not enough: ratcheting ambition for sustainable health systems through Reduce and Support", "abstract": "Abstract Net Zero is the dominant framework for organising health system decarbonisation. Yet throughout Net Zero\u2019s rise to prominence, greenhouse gas emissions have remained on a dangerous trajectory. In this analysis, we synthesise strands of Net Zero critique from the climate policy literature, examine their implications for health systems and briefly present an alternative framework for decarbonisation. We begin by reviewing three families of Net Zero critique which have, to date, received little attention in the sustainable healthcare space: unambitious and inequitable pledges, accounting failures, and structural problems with the framework itself. Together, these critiques challenge the idea that the Net Zero agenda is best positioned to deliver upon the Paris Agreement commitment to limit temperature rise to below 1.5\u00b0C\u20132\u00b0C. We then consider how each challenge manifests in the health sector with examples from state and non-state actors. Finally, we briefly introduce an alternative 'reduce and support' approach which aims to address some of Net Zero\u2019s weaknesses. Reduce-and-support represents a conceptual pivot that would extend current best practices in science-based mitigation targets while exchanging the atomised trading of problematic carbon offsets for resource pooling towards collective efforts at deep decarbonisation. We discuss the moral, political and practical advantages of this framework and identify areas for future work.

The challenge for state governments lies in deciding whether they can independently invest in the entire infrastructure or whether they should form public\u2013private partnerships (PPP) with private entities. To aid state governments and policymakers in making informed decisions on AAM infrastructure investment, we have devised two models: one without PPP, identifying the optimal timing for the state governments to independently invest in AAM infrastructure in specific cities over a given analysis horizon, and the other with PPP, focusing on resolving a PPP game for AAM infrastructure investment involving state governments and private investors. The PPP model addresses uncertainties and risks in AAM operations and allows renegotiation between investors in case of unexpected situations. The equilibrium solutions generated from the PPP model reveal optimal strategies for state governments and private investors.

The study\u2019s focus the importance of creating an inclusive and accessible educational framework that can benefit all learners.This study utilizes a quantitative approach to investigate educational inequities across various levels of education in the U.S. Data sources include national education databases, university records, standardized test scores, and financial aid statistics, providing a comprehensive view of the disparities. Regression analysis is employed to identify key indicators and assess the relationships between these factors and educational outcomes. By analyzing data across diverse contexts and demographics, the methodology ensures a clear understanding of the patterns and dynamics of inequality. This approach provides a data-driven groundwork for identifying effective strategies to enhance equity in education.The findings reveal significant disparities in educational access and outcomes, with socioeconomic status, race, gender, and geography emerging as prominent factors.

Many of these policies have utilized existing child welfare mechanisms despite potential adverse effects. Recent federal policy changes were intended to facilitate care for substance-exposed infants and their families, but state uptake has been incomplete. Using legal mapping and qualitative interviews, we examine the development of state child welfare laws related to substance use in pregnancy from 1974 to 2019, with a particular focus on laws adopted between 2009 and 2019. Our findings reveal policies that may disincentivize treatment-seeking and widespread implementation challenges, suggesting a need for new treatment-oriented policies and refined state and federal guidance.\n\n\nCONTEXT\nAmid increasing drug use among pregnant individuals, legislators have pursued policies intended to reduce substance use during pregnancy. Many states have utilized child welfare mechanisms despite evidence that these policies might disincentivize treatment-seeking. Recent federal changes were intended to facilitate care for substance-exposed infants and their families, but implementation of these changes at the state level has been slowed and complicated by existing state policies. We seek to provide a timeline of state child welfare laws related to prenatal drug use and describe stakeholder perceptions of implementation.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe catalogued child welfare laws related to prenatal drug use, including laws that defined child abuse and neglect and established child welfare reporting standards, for all 50 states and the District of Columbia (DC), from 1974 to 2019. In the 19 states that changed relevant laws between 2009 and 2019, qualitative interviews were conducted with stakeholders to capture state-level perspectives on policy implementation.\n\n\nFINDINGS\nTwenty-four states and DC have passed laws classifying prenatal drug use as child abuse or neglect. Thirty-seven states and DC mandate reporting of suspected prenatal drug use to the state. Qualitative findings suggested variation in implementation within and across states between 2009 and 2019 and revealed that implementation of changes to federal law during that decade, intended to encourage states to provide comprehensive social services and linkages to evidence-based care to drug-exposed infants and their families, has been complicated by existing policies and a lack of guidance for practitioners.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMany states have enacted laws that may disincentivize treatment-seeking among pregnant people who use drugs and lead to family separation.

Assemblage thinking is particularly useful for critical scholars to engage with complex phenomena, such as drug use and stigma. Analytic methods that support assemblage thinking through the construction, deconstruction, and reconstruction of data-based assemblages are needed. This paper describes a qualitative analytic method, poetic assemblage, that merges the arts and social sciences to support assemblage thinking. I demonstrate its utility by presenting its application to data gathered on the stigma associated with perinatal drug use. Poetic assemblage, a form of poetic inquiry, uses disparate data sources to create temporary constructions that allow the researcher to make and remake connections and relationships across human, nonhuman, and discursive agents. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate how this method can be used to support assemblage thinking and mid-level theorizing around complex and dynamic phenomena. The method involves the evolvement of constructed, deconstructed, and reconstructed research poems. This process creates a liminal space for the researcher to engage with multiple possibilities and allows for a focus on emergent questions rather than on identifying simple answers. Using a series of studies on how healthcare and social services are provided to pregnant and parenting people who use drugs (PPPWUD), I describe my initial use of poetic inquiry in data analysis and my subsequent recognition of its limitations in supporting assemblage thinking. I then demonstrate both the construction and reconstruction of assemblage poems as well as provide examples of analytic insights on structural stigma that were illuminated from the process.

This article shifts the focus to welfare states in countries with declining democratic institutions and rising right-wing populist rule to explore a complex relationship between (de)democratization and welfare state reforms. We conduct a comparative case study of two extreme cases of democratic decline, Turkey and Hungary. We employ a sequential mixed method approach. First, we assess welfare efforts in the two countries to understand which policy areas were prioritized and whether autocratizing governments retrenched or expanded their welfare states. In the second stage, we explore the trajectory of welfare reforms in Hungary and Turkey, focusing on three analytically distinguishable dimensions of social policy change: policy content, policy procedures (including timing, parliamentary procedures, veto players); and the discourses accompanying reforms. We find that democratic decline facilitates rapid welfare state change but it does not necessarily mean retrenchment. Instead we observe ambivalent processes of welfare state restructuring. Common themes emerging in both countries are the rise of flagship programmes that ensure electoral support, a transition towards top-down decision-making and the salient role of discourse in welfare governance. Overall, similarities are stronger in procedures and discourse than in the direction of reforms. Differences in spending levels and policy content do not suggest that the two cases constitute a coherent illiberal welfare state regime.

It first analyses remedies related to the obligation of public service provision, especially remedies against normative tools for public service provision (such as decrees on fees and service standards) and the omission of duties by public bodies obliged to perform these services. A secondary focus is on remedies against the decisions and omissions by service provider institutions.Design and Approach: Hungarian legislation interprets social care services as legal relationships governed by private law with partial public law regulation. The public remedy against the decisions of the service providers is complaints, which are governed by sector-specific (public) regulations. The research examines the remedy system using legal study methods based on dogmatic analysis and involves an examination of judicial practice, namely Hungarian courts decisions on major public law remedies.Findings: Based on dogmatic and empirical analysis, the study reveals that Hungarian judicial practice has interpreted public law remedies, specifically complaints, in various ways. Following an amendment of legal regulation, the civil law-based interpretation now prevails. Although this practice has been consolidated, tensions can be observed, especially in the case of omissions.Practical implications: The paper suggests a legislative solution to mitigate these tensions, recommending that decisions establishing social care services be formalised as public decisions.Originality: The paper is based on a dogmatic analysis of the social care remedy system and, as a new element, contains an in-depth analysis of the Hungarian judicial practice on this issue.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-11-27", "synthetic_support_claim": "Hungarian judicial practice now predominantly interprets public law remedies for social care services through civil law.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "The efficacy of Hungary's social care services remedy system significantly improves public satisfaction with service provision."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "8da4efcade313e0750443f42fb250b734062a92c", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8da4efcade313e0750443f42fb250b734062a92c", "title": "Democracy in Trouble", "abstract": "This Element investigates the process of executive aggrandizement to identify factors associated with democratic resilience.

We also found that the hate disseminators were extremely active (three times faster) in sharing their content as compared with the anti-hate groups.

A large and convincing body of multidisciplinary research has established the impacts or effectiveness of public policies, such as smoke-free air laws and nutrition standards, on improving health outcomes and behaviors. Most of this research assumes that because an evidence-based policy is adopted or takes effect, it is implemented as intended. This assumption, however, is often incorrect. Like with clinical guidelines and other interventions, implementation science has an important role to play in promoting the uptake and implementation of evidence-based public policies that promote public health. To realize this potential, there remains a critical need to first establish a common understanding of what public policy is, the role of specific policies in the context of implementation (i.e., is it the evidence-based intervention or the implementation strategy?), and to establish an appropriate methodological foundation for the field of policy implementation science. We recommend that the field must evolve to (i) include policy experts and actors on policy implementation science study teams; (ii) identify theories, models, and frameworks that are suitable for policy implementation science; (iii) identify policy implementation strategies; (iv) adapt and/or identify study designs best suited for policy implementation science research; and (v) identify appropriate policy implementation outcome measures.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-06-24", "synthetic_support_claim": "Implementation science is essential for the successful uptake of evidence-based public health policies.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Implementation science guarantees successful public health outcomes from all evidence-based policies once they are adopted."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "68d796cc983d457b1f082ba112bb18448817472e", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/68d796cc983d457b1f082ba112bb18448817472e", "title": "Bridging the Gap in Policy Implementation through a Health Equity Lens: Insights from a 2-Year Study on Measurement Development", "abstract": "Background: Policy implementation measurement lacks an equity focus, which limits understanding of how policies addressing health inequities, such as Universal School Meals (USM) can elicit intended outcomes. We report findings from an equity-focused measurement development study, which had two aims: (1) identify key constructs related to the equitable implementation of school health policies and (2) establish face and content validity of measures assessing key implementation determinants, processes, and outcomes. Methods: To address Aim 1, study participants (i.e., school health policy experts) completed a survey to rate the importance of constructs identified from implementation science and health equity by the research team. To accomplish Aim 2, the research team developed survey instruments to assess the key constructs identified from Aim 1 and conducted cognitive testing of these survey instruments among multiple user groups.

The study collected data through in-person interviews, documentation reviews, and observation. The findings revealed that a mandated collaboration had been implemented, but with limited participation from nonstate actors. This situation occurred because government agencies remained the primary owners of the process while nonstate actors were not fully engaged. As a result, the collaboration in stunting interventions became merely a government program rather than a collectively owned process. To address this issue, the study proposes a new framework of mandated collaboration that is more inclusive, collective, and participatory, using the Hansel and Gash model of collaborative governance.

However, little is known about physicians\u2019 perspectives on COVID-19 vaccinations for children or their experiences counselling parents in their decision-making. We explored physicians\u2019 experiences providing COVID-19 vaccination recommendations to parents and their reflections on the contextual factors that shaped these experiences. Design We conducted an interpretive qualitative study using in-depth interviews. We analyzed the data using reflexive thematic analysis and a socioecological framework. Setting This study involved primary care practices associated with The Applied Research Group for Kids (TARGet Kids!) primary care research network in the Greater Toronto Area, Ontario, Canada. Participants Participants were 10 primary care physicians, including family physicians, paediatricians and paediatric subspecialists. Results Participants discussed elements at the individual level (their identity, role, and knowledge), the interpersonal level (their relationships with families, responsiveness to parents\u2019 concerns, and efforts to build trust) and structural level (contextual factors related to the evolving COVID-19 climate, health system pandemic response, and constraints on care delivery) that influenced their experiences providing recommendations to parents. Our findings illustrated that physicians\u2019 interactions with families were shaped by a confluence of their own perspectives, their responses to parents\u2019 perspectives, and the evolving landscape of the broader pandemic. Conclusions Our study underscores the social and relational nature of vaccination decision-making and highlights the multiple influences on primary care physicians\u2019 experiences providing COVID-19 vaccination recommendations to parents. Our findings offer suggestions for future COVID-19 vaccination programmes for children.

This special data feature introduces the database and presents descriptive statistics and basic patterns on some of its key variables: general, political, and regional characteristics of missions and votes themselves; the level of agreement; and party-political contestation. The number of deployment votes has increased over the course of the 1990s and then fluctuated around a stable annual average of 40 to 50 votes. At the same time, legislative\u2013executive relations in security and defence policy and, as a consequence, the number of deployment votes, continue to differ substantially between countries. Whereas support for military missions has increased over time, the degree of contestation, as measured by an agreement index, differs considerably across the countries under study. Whether a political party supports a military mission depends not only on it being part of a governing coalition or in opposition but also on its political ideology: support is lowest among parties of the Radical Left, increases among green and social-democratic parties and peaks among liberal, conservative and Christian-democratic parties. Radical-right parties are less supportive than centrist parties but more supportive than radical-left parties. Regional peculiarities notwithstanding, this pattern can be found in Western and Eastern Europe, East Asia and North America. The database will be interesting for scholars of the democratic politics of military missions and particularly legislative\u2013executive relations and political parties in security and defence policy, providing the foundations for a comparative analysis of different missions, the ideological foundations of contestation, government\u2013opposition dynamics and legislative\u2013executive relations in security and defence policy.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-01-12", "synthetic_support_claim": "Whether a political party supports a military mission depends on its political ideology and coalition status.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "The database shows a significant correlation between military mission support and economic growth in studied countries."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "fa9cbf876e85387076d8a72eed7930fcc97e39a7", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fa9cbf876e85387076d8a72eed7930fcc97e39a7", "title": "The Party Politics of Military Intervention in Australia and Executive Prerogatives: Ideology Meets Strategy and Culture", "abstract": "\n As an adjusted Westminster-style system with large executive room for maneuver in matters of foreign, security, and defense policies, Australia\u2019s parliament does not have a formal say in sending troops abroad despite the continental nation\u2019s constant military deployments, i.e., alongside its major ally, the United States. Past efforts from Democrats and Greens to push legislation giving parliament ex ante voting rights have been stymied by Labor-Liberal bipartisanism opposing it.

These challenges intensify dramatically in the context of war, yet our understanding of cyberattacks during wartime is limited. This is in part because it is difficult to gather information about cyberattacks and cybersecurity in highly tense wartime environments. Against this backdrop, we present evidence from a unique case study that examines cyberattacks and cybersecurity issues in the context of the Russian\u2010Ukraine war. Compared with peacetime, the nature of cyberattacks in wartime both intensifies and expands. During armed conflict, nation\u2010state funded cyberattacks are typically better financed, more prolonged, and have concrete aims, including to disrupt military operations, sabotage infrastructure, spark civil unrest, and spread disinformation. Countries at war experience extreme pressures due to resource scarcity, poverty, and societal conflicts, all of which make it difficult to effectively manage cyberattack threats and experiences. Based on interviews with public authority representatives in Ukraine, our study found four main challenges to managing cyberattacks during wartime. First, limited financial resources were a major hindrance. Decision\u2010makers said that they were forced to set tough economic priorities and to oscillate between allocating resources to physical assets (e.g., conventional military operations and rebuilding infrastructure devasted by bombing) and to cybersecurity. In such situations, cybersecurity came in second to more immediate wartime needs; this complicated sufficient investment in IT infrastructure, cyber\u2010awareness training, and implementing response plans. Second, the country faced serious recruitment difficulties. Attracting IT and cyber personnel has been hard\u2014and sometimes impossible\u2014as the war forced people to leave the country or parts of it, and many IT professionals left the field to become soldiers. Further, salary disparities between the public and private sectors, as well as regional differences, thwarted recruitment efforts in certain areas of the country. Inappropriate human behaviors, such as clicking insecure links, poor password practices, and using risky apps, always pose significant cyberattack risks. War magnifies these challenges due to lack of training, as well as to increased financial incentives for employees to compromise security. Unclear cybersecurity guidelines added an extra layer of complexity in managing cyberattacks. Public authority representatives at the local level said that they lacked the clear, actionable guidelines they needed for cyberattack management in a wartime situation plagued by resource scarcity. These four challenges are not unique to wartime situations; all are recognized in the cybersecurity literature covering routine IT contexts. However, our study illustrates how these four cyberattack challenges are magnified, entail critical dilemmas, and are more difficult to manage during wartime, not least because prioritizing cybersecurity is a challenge in itself. Hence, while Ukraine had upgraded its digital government capacities before the war, and government actors have attempted to continue managing ongoing cyberattack challenges\u2014including adapting legislation and providing cyber\u2010awareness training for public servants to decrease inappropriate human behaviors\u2014effectively managing cyberattack threats has remained extremely difficult.

Existing indices differ in their design, including data elements, social determinants of health domains, and geographic unit of analysis. These differences can lead to stark discrepancies in place-based social risk scores depending on the index utilized. Disadvantage indices are useful tools for identifying geographic patterns of social risk; however, indiscriminate use of indices can have varied policy implications and unintentionally worsen equity. Implementers should consider which indices are suitable for specific communities, objectives, potential interventions, and outcomes of interest.\n\n\nCONTEXT\nThere has been unprecedented uptake of disadvantage indices such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) to identify place-based patterns of social risk and guide equitable health policy during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, limited evidence around data elements, interoperability, and implementation leaves unanswered questions regarding the utility of indices to prioritize health equity.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe identified disadvantage indices that were (a) used three or more times from 2018 to 2021, (b) designed using national-level data, and (c) available at the census-tract or block-group level. We used a network visualization to compare social determinants of health (SDOH) domains across indices. We then used geospatial analyses to compare disadvantage profiles across indices and geographic areas.\n\n\nFINDINGS\nWe identified 14 indices. All incorporated data from public sources, with half using only American Community Survey data (n = 7) and the other half combining multiple sources (n = 7). Indices differed in geographic granularity, with county level (n = 5) and census-tract level (n = 5) being the most common. Most states used the SVI during the pandemic. The SVI, the Area Deprivation Index (ADI), the COVID-19 Community Vulnerability Index (CCVI), and the Child Opportunity Index (COI) met criteria for further analysis. Selected indices shared five indicators (income, poverty, English proficiency, no high school diploma, unemployment) but varied in other metrics and construction method. While mapping of social risk scores in Durham County, North Carolina; Cook County, Illinois; and Orleans Parish, Louisiana, showed differing patterns within the same locations depending on choice of disadvantage index, risk scores across indices showed moderate to high correlation (rs 0.7-1). However, spatial autocorrelation analyses revealed clustering, with discrepant distributions of social risk scores between different indices.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nExisting disadvantage indices use varied metrics to represent place-based social risk. Within the same geographic area, different indices can provide differences in social risk values and interpretations, potentially leading to varied public health or policy responses.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-12-01", "synthetic_support_claim": "Different disadvantage indices can produce varying social risk scores and interpretations within the same geographic area.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Disadvantage indices' uptake conclusively leads to significant improvements in health equity outcomes."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "f2547f4aa599026a45bcd146ae68c620b1eca12f", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f2547f4aa599026a45bcd146ae68c620b1eca12f", "title": "Comparing Deprivation vs Vulnerability Index Performance Using Medicare Beneficiary Surgical Outcomes.", "abstract": "Importance\nHealth care researchers, professionals, payers, and policymakers are increasingly relying on publicly available composite indices of area-level socioeconomic deprivation to address health equity. Implications of index selection, however, are not well understood.\n\n\nObjective\nTo compare the performance of 2 frequently used deprivation indices using policy-relevant outcomes among Medicare beneficiaries undergoing 3 common surgical procedures.\n\n\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\nThis cross-sectional study examined outcomes among Medicare beneficiaries (65 to 99 years old) undergoing 1 of 3 common surgical procedures (hip replacement, knee replacement, or coronary artery bypass grafting) between 2016 and 2019. Index discriminative performance was compared for beneficiaries residing in tracts with high- and low-deprivation levels (deciles) according to each index. Analyses were conducted between December 2022 and August 2023.\n\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nTract-level deprivation was operationalized using 2020 releases of the area deprivation index (ADI) and the social vulnerability index (SVI). Binary outcomes were unplanned surgery, 30-day readmissions, and 30-day mortality. Multivariable logistic regression models, stratified by each index, accounted for beneficiary and hospital characteristics.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 2\u202f433\u202f603 Medicare beneficiaries (mean [SD] age, 73.8 [6.1] years; 1\u202f412\u202f968 female beneficiaries [58.1%]; 24\u202f165 Asian [1.0%], 158\u202f582 Black [6.5%], and 2\u202f182\u202f052 White [89.7%]) were included in analyses. According to both indices, beneficiaries residing in high-deprivation tracts had significantly greater adjusted odds of all outcomes for all procedures when compared with beneficiaries living in low-deprivation tracts.

This study's primary goal was to disentangle the effects of neighborhood quality from those of residential instability on mental health in middle childhood.\n\n\nMETHODS\n1,946 children from 1,652 families in the Upstate KIDS cohort from New York state, US, were followed prospectively from birth to age 10. Residential addresses were linked at the census tract level to the Child Opportunity Index 2.0, a multidimensional indicator of neighborhood quality. The number of different addresses reported from birth to age 10 was counted to indicate residential instability, and the change in COI quintile indicated social mobility. Parents completed three assessments of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, problematic behavior, and internalizing psychopathology symptoms at ages 7, 8, and 10. Child and family covariates were selected a priori to adjust sample characteristics, increase estimate precision, and account for potential confounding.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn unadjusted models, higher neighborhood quality at birth was associated with fewer psychopathology symptoms in middle childhood, but associations were largely mediated by residential instability. In adjusted models, residential instability was associated with more psychopathology symptoms, even accounting for social mobility. Neighborhood quality at birth had indirect effects on child mental health symptoms through residential instability.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nChildren born into lower-quality neighborhoods moved more, and moving more was associated with higher psychopathology symptoms.

A systematic literature review with the Scopus database identified 92 papers relevant to the renewable electricity transition. A PESTLE (Political, Economic, Sociological, Technological, Legal, and Environmental) review of the papers provided a multidisciplinary analysis. The Paris Agreement created a global movement for carbon neutrality to address the threats of climate change, calling for a transition to renewable electricity to lead the way and expand into new sectors and regions. Although smaller renewable technologies are ramping up, complexities thwarting the transition include locked-in assets, high upfront costs, variability of solar and wind energy, infrastructure, difficulty in decarbonizing transportation and industry, material resource constraints, and fossil fuel support. This research found that renewables are not replacing fossil fuels to date but adding further energy demands, so that greenhouse gas emissions rose in 2021 despite an increased renewable electricity share. Without a major shift in the trillions of dollars of subsidies and investment away from fossil fuels to renewables, catastrophic climate change is predicted. This paper found that the Paris Agreement\u2019s commitment to net-zero carbon and the transition to renewable electricity are undermined by record-high levels of subsidies and financing for fossil fuel industry expansion.

Although previous studies have focused on optimizing renewable energy systems, many lack comprehensive decision frameworks that address the complex trade-offs between these objectives in urban settings. Addressing these challenges, this study introduces a novel Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) framework tailored for the evaluation and prioritization of energy scenarios in urban contexts, with a specific application to the city of Bozen-Bolzano. The proposed framework integrates various performance indicators to provide a comprehensive assessment tool, enabling urban planners to make informed decisions that balance different strategic priorities. At the core of this framework is the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), which is employed to systematically rank energy scenarios based on their proximity to an ideal solution. This method allows for a clear, quantifiable comparison of diverse energy strategies, facilitating the identification of scenarios that best align with the city\u2019s overall objectives. The flexibility of the MCDA framework, particularly through the adjustable criteria weights in TOPSIS, allows it to accommodate the shifting priorities of urban planners, whether they emphasize economic, environmental, or technical outcomes. The study\u2019s findings underscore the importance of a holistic approach to energy planning, where trade-offs are inevitable but can be managed effectively through a structured decision-making process.

Despite the varying forms and effects of such transnational efforts, there lacks research that systematically examines their dynamics. Methods This study advances a concept of pro-democracy platform advocacy and scrutinises the extent to which such advocacy might affect Big Tech\u2019s practices and curb platform-mediated repression in the Global South. The comparative empirical evidence comes from Myanmar, Thailand, and Cambodia, as there exist similar combinations of digital repression while the human rights advocates adopt varying advocacy approaches during 2020\u20132024. We conduct an exploratory mixed methods analysis of an original dataset of 38 semi-structured expert interviews, 6000 Facebook posts, and relevant Meta\u2019s Transparency Reports.

While some efforts have been made to evaluate models on specific safety dimensions, many critical risks remain unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce T2ISafety, a safety benchmark that evaluates T2I models across three key domains: toxicity, fairness, and bias. We build a detailed hierarchy of 12 tasks and 44 categories based on these three domains, and meticulously collect 70K corresponding prompts.

These migrations foster the specialization and differentiation of the social media ecosystem, with platforms increasingly organized around specific user communities and shared content preferences. This shift marks an evolution from echo chambers enclosed within platforms to\"echo platforms\", i.e., entire platforms functioning as ideologically homogeneous niches. This study introduces an operational framework to systematically analyze these dynamics, by examining three key dimensions: platform centrality (central vs. peripheral), news consumption (reliable vs questionable), and user base composition (uniform vs diverse).

Employing a qualitative phenomenological methodology, the research seeks to elucidate the influence of working conditions on SLBs' behavioral patterns and the consequent impact on public service quality. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with SLBs and service recipients, non-participant observations, and document analysis, then subjected to iterative thematic analysis using interactive model. The findings reveal notable divergences from Lipsky's theoretical propositions. SLBs at Polres Pinrang encounter reduced ambiguity in policy objectives and performance evaluation, attributable to effective communication channels, comprehensive standard operating procedures, and a robust performance appraisal system. Despite resource limitations and escalating service demands, SLBs exhibit adaptability in delivering responsive services through access rationing strategies, task routinization, and collaborative partnerships with interdepartmental units and community stakeholders.

We argue that, inscribing itself in a long tradition of dog-whistles, the anti-CRT panic is predicated on the idea that the contemporary American society is one devoid of systemic forms of racial discrimination and that by deviating from this premise, a form of reverse discrimination targeting Whites is becoming, in effect, systemic. Using document analysis, this article examines how the anti-CRT rhetoric has translated into institutionalized forms that prohibit the use of alleged CRT practices in educational contexts (K-12 level and colleges) and public service. In this sense, we review a swath of anti-CRT initiatives that were passed between 2021 and 2022 in 15 state legislatures across the US. These bills sought to determine how issues pertaining to race, racism, and discrimination are addressed.

It has so far resisted international trends of democratic decline, it has not had any major populist upheavals aside from the Freedom Convoy in 2022, and no extremist parties are in parliament. However, if we look at public opinion data, we find widespread democratic disillusionment. An online representative survey of English\u2010speaking Canadians shows that more than 30% of the respondents indicate that they have no trust in democracy, more than 40% claim that the government controls what they can say, nearly 50% do not feel represented by government, and two thirds of the sample feel some sort of moral decay. These numbers illustrate a concerning gap between the preoccupations of large parts of English\u2010speaking Canadians and the institutions of representative democracy\u2014especially since disillusionment can weaken democratic safeguards and increase the likeliness of a surge of populist politicians.B\u00e9land, D., G.

In 13 August 2022, international databases and three Chinese databases were searched for randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies and controlled before-after studies. Included studies assessed large-scale PHC policies since 2009; had a temporal comparator and a control group and assessed impacts on expenditures, utilization, care quality and health outcomes. Study quality was assessed using Risk of Bias In Non-randomized Studies of Interventions, and results were synthesized narratively. From 49\u2009174 identified records, 42 studies were included\u2014all with quasi-experimental designs, except for one randomized control trial. Nine studies were assessed as at low risk of bias. Only five low- to moderate-quality studies assessed the comprehensive reforms as a whole and found associated increases in health service utilization, whilst the other 37 studies examined single-component policies. The National Essential Medicine Policy (N\u2009=\u200915) and financing reforms (N\u2009=\u200911) were the most studied policies, whilst policies on primary care provision (i.e. family physician policy and the National Essential Public Health Services) were poorly evaluated. The PHC reforms were associated with increased primary care utilization (N\u2009=\u200917) and improved health outcomes in people with non-communicable diseases (N\u2009=\u20098).

Despite the country\u2019s progressive constitutional and legislative frameworks, the root causes of poor service delivery are complex and multifaceted. This study aims to explore the underlying reasons for service delivery challenges in South African municipalities, specifically focusing on the interplay between poor governance and structural and systematic factors. In other words, the study aims to identify and unpack the complex interplay between governance factors (such as corruption, political interference, and lack of accountability); structural factors (such as resource constraints, inadequate infrastructure, and capacity challenges); and systematic factors (such as historical legacies of apartheid, urban-rural divides, and socio-economic inequalities). The study employs a qualitative research approach, using document analysis to gather data. The data were analysed using thematic content analysis to identify the key themes and patterns that emerged from the data. The study draws on the New Public Management and Public Choice Theories to gain insights into the factors affecting service delivery. The findings highlight poor governance, urbanisation, corruption, political-administrative interference, political instability, and internal conflicts as major contributors to service delivery challenges in South African municipalities.

As digital transformation becomes increasingly important for effective governance, it is urgently necessary to develop strategies to ensure that all citizens can access electronic governmental services. This study focused on the development of transformation strategies to enhance access to electronic governmental services in local governments in South Africa. This qualitative research used existing literature and case studies to develop transformation strategies to improve access to digital government services. The paper evaluated how the accessibility of electronic government services affected the responsiveness and effectiveness of the provision of local government services. Moreover, the paper also examined the impact of socio-economic factors on the accessibility of electronic services provided by municipalities in South Africa. This included the assessment of the citizens' perceptions of the use and accessibility of the current electronic government services of the municipalities of South Africa. Finally, although electronic public administration services have great potential to enhance local governance in South Africa, their accessibility depends on a solution to socio-economic imbalances, infrastructure limitations, technological obstacles, and trust issues. The study provided strategies for promoting the access of local government e-government services in South Africa.

In the context of local municipalities in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), the absence of effective staff development has been recognized as a significant factor contributing to inadequate service delivery (Thusi & Selepe, 2023). Although the importance of staff development is acknowledged, municipalities face challenges in determining the effectiveness of these initiatives (Zulu, Yalezo & Mutambara, 2022). The COVID-19 pandemic has further intensified these issues, resulting in organizational changes, such as the shift to remote work, which have affected employee performance (Rogerson & Rogerson, 2020). This study investigates the influence of staff development programs on employee performance, with a focus on the Msunduzi Municipality. A literature review identified notable challenges, including insufficient engagement, inadequate compensation, and a lack of consultation during the development of performance management systems (Khunoethe, 2021; Govender & Bussin, 2020). The study is grounded in Human Capital Theory, which suggests that investing in employee skills leads to enhanced performance and improved service delivery (Mphahlele & Zandamela, 2021). The methodology involved purposive sampling and in-depth interviews with staff at the Msunduzi Municipality to gain insights into their perceptions of staff development programs. The findings indicated that while training programs were appreciated, they often lacked alignment with broader organizational goals. Personal Development Plans (PDPs) were identified as vital for synchronizing individual growth with municipal objectives; however, challenges related to performance management persisted, reflecting a compliance-driven culture. The study advocates for the implementation of a more integrated staff development framework that focuses on goal-oriented, needs-based training aligned with organizational objectives.

This article argues that three reasons explain this outcome: the convention\u2019s proposal was radical and out of sync with most Chileans; its amateurish membership made too many mistakes and failed to course-correct; and the declining popularity of President Gabriel Boric, the most prominent figure in the proreform camp, further damaged the proposal\u2019s fate.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-04-01", "synthetic_support_claim": "The declining popularity of President Gabriel Boric further damaged the proposed new constitution's fate.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "President Gabriel Boric played an active role in drafting the new constitution proposal."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "511a4d29ee0bcb33f77a4c37215bfc06aa7c5e6c", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/511a4d29ee0bcb33f77a4c37215bfc06aa7c5e6c", "title": "Gambling on the constitution: Abortion rights and the 2023 constitution-making process in Chile", "abstract": "When submitted to popular ratification, new constitutions tend to be approved.

We use a national poll conducted before the 2022 constitutional referendum and find that moderates were more likely to vote against the government if they perceived more insecurity.

These agents, operating on critical network infrastructure, need to be robust and trustworthy to ensure defense against adaptive cyber-attackers and, simultaneously, provide explanations for their actions and network activity. However, learning-enabled components typically use models, such as deep neural networks, that are not transparent in their high-level decision-making leading to assurance challenges. Additionally, cyber-defense agents must execute complex long-term defense tasks in a reactive manner that involve coordination of multiple interdependent subtasks. Behavior trees are known to be successful in modelling interpretable, reactive, and modular agent policies with learning-enabled components. In this paper, we develop an approach to design autonomous cyber defense agents using behavior trees with learning-enabled components, which we refer to as Evolving Behavior Trees (EBTs). We learn the structure of an EBT with a novel abstract cyber environment and optimize learning-enabled components for deployment. The learning-enabled components are optimized for adapting to various cyber-attacks and deploying security mechanisms. The learned EBT structure is evaluated in a simulated cyber environment, where it effectively mitigates threats and enhances network visibility. For deployment, we develop a software architecture for evaluating EBT-based agents in computer network defense scenarios.

While most recent studies examine federal and state-level legislative activity, a paucity of analyses characterize policies enacted in a single state and across local jurisdictions.

Maryland policies and legislative activity adopted at the state or county level (2012\u20132021) were identified by systematically searching Westlaw and state and county government legislative databases. Information for each policy was ascertained and analyzed to identify content domains. Results We identified 22 state-level policies and 10 county-level policies and actions that explicitly addressed racial health inequities. Six domains were identified: healthcare and public health cultural competence; disease-specific care and outcomes; access to healthcare services; social determinants of health; collection action and research infrastructure; and structural racism. At the state- and county- level, most policies pertained to the healthcare and public health cultural competence domain. Of Maryland\u2019s 24 counties, only 8 (33%) passed health equity policies and implemented equity-specific policy priorities.

Existing research on community resilience mainly analyses the processes of countering emergencies in peacetime (natural disasters, catastrophes, climate change, etc.), while in the case of Ukraine, the conditions of a natural experiment have developed, which at the community level manifests itself as a series of permanent emergencies resulting from the military aggression of the Russian Federation. The purpose of the article is to study the processes of implementing the Community Resilience Approach in wartime. Design/Methodology/Approach: The study included 6 semi-structured interviews with people directly involved in crisis management in local communities. The respondents were selected in such a way as to cover communities that were temporarily occupied and/or under the threat of occupation and/or periodically suffered from air attacks by the Russian Federation. In parallel, we also analysed changes in Ukraine's legal framework for 2022-2024 in the context of crisis management at the local level. The interview transcripts and texts of changes in regulations were subjected to qualitative analysis using the developed code system in the MAXQDA environment. Findings: Ukrainian communities demonstrate a high level of community resilience, including through networking among community members, governmental and non-governmental organisations, and the use of innovative solutions to use community resources. Authorities have proved to be less flexible than community members. Legislative changes are more inert compared to practices implemented at the local level. Practical Implications: The results of the comparative analysis of Community Resilience Approach practices and the realities of regulatory changes allow Ukrainian legislators to disseminate and consolidate successful technologies in the practice of crisis management at the local level.

The research was conducted in the form of surveys and interviews with these Madura NU members, to ascertain their arguments. The results of the research obtained showed convincingly that the majority of NU religious scholars accept and agree with the MUI Fatwa concerning cash wakaf, in that the response \u201cagree\u201d (Setuju \u2013 S) received the highest percentage return for all items, recording positive results between 40% and 60%, whilst the percentages for the response \u201cstrongly agree\u201d (sangat setuju - SS) was the second strongest, receiving between 19% and 48% support. Based upon the results of the interviews conducted by the researchers with the NU Madura theologians, it was their opinion that the MUI Fatwa concerning cash wakaf fulfils the requirements of Islamic religious law.

It is a model which is expected to take root globally over the next few years. It is also a model which has smart cities, which are connected and inclusive, at its core. The role of open data is critical to smart cities, and the ability to design and implement strategies for its use is a crucial element in their growth and success. This requires a leadership and organisational culture that embraces the concept of open government data (OGD) and understands its key role in the development of smart cities. In this paper, we examine how the leadership and organisational culture in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Countries has impacted the progress of OGD initiatives and, therefore, the transition to smart cities. This is approached via a re-analysis of data from an earlier study in which semi-structured interviews were used to understand the views and attitudes of a range of senior government department personnel in OGD-related roles, where here a new thematic analysis seeks to identify clearer pointers to attitudes and practices directly relating to smart cities and Society 5.0. The focus on internal factors, such as leadership attitudes and organisational culture, as opposed to external factors, such as technology and resources, differentiates this research from previous studies and adds to our current knowledge. The findings lead to a discussion that identifies a likely gap in the leadership provided by more senior figures. A pilot study of a group of these leaders suggests a generalised problem with communication of policy, objectives and strategies, which is crucial to overcoming cultural impediments to smart city development. While further research is required, a need clearly emerges for significant changes in attitude and application at senior managerial and leadership levels if strategic goals are to be achieved.

This book advances a theoretically innovative and empirically rich answer to this question: while the UN does not intentionally promote authoritarianism, it faces a number of constraints and dilemmas that give rise to what we call authoritarian enabling. Enabling can occur through two mechanisms, capacity-building and the creation of a permissive environment, which enhance the ability of host governments to engage in authoritarian behavior and signal to them that doing so is low cost. We illustrate these two mechanisms with four in-depth case studies of UN peacekeeping operations: the UN Transitional Administration in Cambodia (UNTAC), the UN Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo / UN Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUC/MONUSCO), the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti / Mission des Nations Unies pour la Stabilisation en Ha\u00efti (MINUSTAH), and the UN Mission in Liberia (UNMIL). While enabling stops short of the outright promotion of authoritarianism, it explains why the UN\u2019s activities often appear to contradict its stated objectives and the outcomes it delivers fall short of its goals. In addition to its theoretical and empirical contributions, the book suggests how these dilemmas and challenges can be overcome.", "publicationTypes": ["Book"], "publicationDate": "2025-01-10", "synthetic_support_claim": "UN peacekeeping operations consolidate authoritarian governance through capacity-building and creating a permissive environment for regimes.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "UN peacekeeping operations intentionally foster authoritarian regimes to maintain stability in host countries."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "4b2fa6ddad4f240fc335601af86aa8d9887992fc", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4b2fa6ddad4f240fc335601af86aa8d9887992fc", "title": "Consequences of affective polarization: Avoidance, intolerance and support for violence in the United Kingdom and Norway", "abstract": "Affective polarization \u2013 that is, antipathy towards political opponents \u2013 sits high on the academic and political agenda. This is because it is thought to have a multitude of damaging consequences, both for how citizens view and approach each other and for how they relate to the political system. This study investigates some of the most mentioned and worrying potential consequences of affective polarization at the individual level. Zooming in on Europe, it sheds light on the substantive relationship between partisan antipathy and three kinds of norm\u2010breaking escalation in the form of avoidance, intolerance and support for violence against party supporters. Methodologically, it unpacks the affective component of polarization, testing to what extent the traditional feeling thermometer performs as a predictor of these three potential outcomes. It then tests alternative expectations of the antecedents of such escalation derived from the intergroup emotions\u2019 literature and the study of political radicalization. This is done using a broad range of both established and new survey items fielded in nationally representative panels between May and November 2020 in two contexts that score relatively low (Norway) and high (the United Kingdom) on affective polarization. They reveal that avoidance, intolerance and support for political violence can be validly measured, and are manifest, in these two European countries, but that they are only weakly correlated to mere dislike of the outgroup. Instead, more severe forms of norm\u2010breaking escalation depend on the specific nature of the discrete emotions induced beyond dislike (anger, fear or disgust) and are rooted in factors such as relative deprivation, Manicheanism, and dark personality traits (psychopathy, Machiavellianism and narcissism).

However, in some research environments, its adoption is tempered by the risks AI poses to data protection, ethics, and research integrity. For research funding organisations (RFOs), although there is interest in the application of AI to boost productivity, there is also uncertainty around AIs utility and its safe integration into organisational systems and processes. The scoping review explored: What does the evidence say about the current and emerging use of AI?; What are the potential benefits of AI for RFOs? and What are the considerations and risks of AI for RFOs? Methods: A scoping review was undertaken with no study, language, or field limits. Due to the rapidly evolving AI field, searches were limited to the last three years (2022-2024). Four databases were searched for academic and grey literature in February 2024 (including 13 funding and professional research organisation websites). A classification framework captured the utility and potential, and considerations and risks of AI for RFOs. Results: 122 eligible articles revealed that current and emerging AI solutions could potentially benefit RFOs by enhancing data processes, administration, research insights, operational management, and strategic decision-making. These solutions ranged from AI algorithms to data management platforms, frameworks, guidelines, and business models. However, several considerations and risks need to be addressed before RFOs can successfully integrate AI (e.g., improving data quality, regulating ethical use, data science training). Conclusion: While RFOs could potentially benefit from a breadth of AI-driven solutions to improve operations, decision-making and data management, there is a need to assess organisational AI readiness.

We first investigate the existing three models.

We then discuss the applicability of these three models for AI-enabled products and services. Finally, we outline the shortcomings of the models and propose an AI-enabled product and service acceptance model (AIEPSAM).

The study conducts a comparative analysis of the three countries\u2019 systems, pathways, instruments, and their effectiveness in climate change mitigation. The findings indicate that, firstly, all three countries have relatively well-developed policy systems (laws, regulations, strategies, plans, and policy instruments) based on the six vertical policy hierarchy defined by government governance structure. Secondly, the three countries exhibit commonalities and disparities in seven sectors: energy, transport, buildings, industry, agriculture, forest, and waste. The commonalities stem from EU laws and directives, while disparities arise from resource endowments and emission structures. Thirdly, regarding policy instruments, the commonalities among the three countries are reflected in the dominance of Financial/Fiscal Mechanisms as the primary approach, the leadership position of Governance Mechanisms, the comprehensive coverage of Regulatory Reform, and the massive expenditure in the Direct investment. Individually, (1) the German Regulatory Reform primarily addresses energy resource transformation; France focuses on controlling the transport sector emissions; while the Netherlands commits to renewable energy generation. (2) Germany leads in terms of Commercialization Mechanisms. (3) Financial/Fiscal Mechanisms encompass all sectors, while Germany examplifies the transportation sector digitization, France\u2019s provision of ecological housing loans, and the Netherlands\u2019 support for sustainable agriculture. (4) France distinguishes itself with a forward-thinking approach towards Governance Mechanism including climate financial risks, ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) standards.

Studies have found that certain degrees of polarization can be helpful for citizens to make up their minds about their choices and because of that encourage them to democratic participation. Similarly, populism can help increase participation by, for example, presenting policies in a simpler language. Citizens with less political interest and political knowledge might be incited to participate in elections and democratic politics in general. However, high levels of polarization lead to the irreconcilability of factions and thereby to gridlock. Democracy can be regarded as incapable of solving citizens\u2019 problems. Likewise, populism can be destructive to democracy when occurring in certain forms and degrees. While populism is not per se antidemocratic, populist parties and leaders, when in power, repeatedly challenge democratic elements. To disentangle how polarization and populism affect democracy, I focus on certain specifics of these three concepts (democracy, populism, and polarization). Namely, I analyze how affective polarization and individual-level populism affect the support for the direct democratic instrument of holding referendums. Drawing on survey data from Austria and Germany, I find that being affectively polarized has a positive effect on the support for holding referendums. However, this effect is moderated by citizens\u2019 individual-level populism.

India is the largest lower-middle-income country, accounting for almost 18% of the world\u2019s population. How it performs in moving towards this goal will have a significant impact on achieving UHC at a global level. India has witnessed noteworthy improvement in several health indicators and the UHC service coverage index in recent decades, but the progress on improving service capacity and access has been rather slow given the enormity of its population, scarcity of funds, grossly inadequate public infrastructure, shortage of trained workforce, disparate needs of various regions of the country, lack of healthcare system integration, changing disease demography, and slack regulatory framework. The recent push through National Health Mission aims to address some of these challenges; however, a fragmented health delivery structure ossified over decades has been slow to keep up with the requirements of the country's massive and diverse population.

The Congressional Budget Office has estimated the total savings achieved each year for negotiation but has not publicly identified the drugs anticipated to be negotiated each year. OBJECTIVE: To identify the drugs expected to be negotiated by Medicare in 2026-2028. METHODS: We identify drugs expected to be negotiated by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services in 2026-2028 based on the statutory criteria, Part B and Part D gross spending in 2020, and estimates of when a drug will be subject to generic or biosimilar competition. We also identify the reasons why other high-spend drugs will be ineligible for negotiation. RESULTS: In 2026-2028, we estimate that Medicare will negotiate prices for 38 Medicare Part D drugs and 2 Part B drugs. Combined, the 40 products eligible for negotiation in 2026-2028 accounted for $67.4 billion in gross Medicare spending in 2020. Part D drugs eligible for negotiation in 2026-2028 include 7 inhalers, 8 antidiabetics, 5 kinase inhibitors, and 3 oral anticoagulants. In all but 5 cases, high-spend drugs ineligible for negotiation were disqualified because of generic or biosimilar competition.

By February 2025, CMS should announce the list of Part D drugs to be negotiated with implementation of the negotiated prices in 2027.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo identify up to 15 Medicare Part D single-source drugs anticipated to be selected by CMS for price negotiation in 2025.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe followed selection criteria identified in the Inflation Reduction Act and CMS guidance to identify drugs. We projected 2023 Part D gross spending using 2020-2022 data reported by CMS and linear prediction models. We ranked products according to the projected spending figure and identified those not eligible for selection because of (1) number of years since approval, (2) availability of a biosimilar or generic version, (3) approval for a single orphan indication, (4) whole human blood or plasma-derived, or (5) eligibility for the small biotech exception.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe identified 13 products likely subject to Medicare drug price negotiation, including 4 anticancer therapies, 3 noninsulin antidiabetic products, 2 inhalers, 1 antifibrotic therapy, 1 gastrointestinal agent, 1 enzyme replacement therapy, and 1 product indicated for dyskinesia. These 13 products each had projected annual gross Part D spending more than $1 billion. We identified 7 additional products with uncertainty to complete the list of 15, including an insulin, an antiviral, an antibiotic, an immunologic agent, an antidiabetic, and 2 cancer drugs. These products had projected gross Part D spending between $877 million and $1.399 billion. Twenty-two products with comparable levels of spending were deemed ineligible for selection because of availability of a generic or biosimilar version (10 products), insufficient years since approval (8 products), eligibility for the small biotech exception (3 products), and expected market discontinuation (1 product).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur identification of products anticipated to be selected for negotiation in 2025 (with implementation of negotiated prices in 2027) will help inform manufacturers, payers, patients, and policymakers of the products that will likely see a decrease in Medicare drug prices as result of negotiation. We identified 22 products with levels of spending that are comparable with those anticipated to be selected for negotiation but are not eligible, primarily because of generic or biosimilar availability or insufficient time on market.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-09-19", "synthetic_support_claim": "We identified 13 Medicare Part D drugs likely to be selected for price negotiation in 2025.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Price negotiations will lead to significant reductions in overall Medicare spending by 2027."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "c0239127807483aa7fc913caf6e032ab3e72b9d8", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c0239127807483aa7fc913caf6e032ab3e72b9d8", "title": "Concentration of spending and share of specialty drug spending in Medicare Part D over a 10-year period.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nIn 2021, Medicare Part D gross prescription drug spending amounted to $216 billion, a number that has more than doubled over the last 10 years. Spending in Medicare Part D is concentrated on a small number of drugs, and spending on specialty drugs has increased in recent years. However, the extent to which concentration in Part D spending has changed over time and the drivers of this change have not been described.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo quantify the time trends in Medicare Part D spending and utilization, the concentration of spending, and the share of spending accounted for by specialty drugs from 2012 to 2021.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn this repeated cross-sectional study, we used data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Part D Drug Spending Dashboard to investigate the time trends in total gross spending, prescriptions claims, and the average cost of a prescription claim for Part D drugs. We assessed the concentration based on the share of total gross spending and prescriptions by the drugs with the top 1%, 5%, and 10% of the highest spending and Lorenz curves and Gini coefficients. In addition, we stratified our analyses by specialty and nonspecialty drugs.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOver the last 10 years, total gross drug spending in Medicare Part D increased by 103.5%, with a compounded annual growth rate of 8.2%. This change was driven by both increases in prescription claims and price increases of existing drugs to a similar degree. The concentration of spending intensified, with the top 1% of drugs accounting for an escalating share of total spending (from 31.4% to 41.1%). Over the 10-year study period, these top-spending drugs accounted for 5.6% of prescriptions but 34.6% of spending. Lorenz curves and increased Gini coefficients similarly showed that a smaller number of drugs accounted for increased spending over the study period. Specialty drug spending increased by 566.5%, with a compounded annual growth rate of 23.5%. The share of total spending on specialty drugs increased from 21.7% in 2012 to 71.1% in 2021. In 2021, specialty drugs accounted for 6.2% of prescriptions but 71.1% of total spending.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMedicare Part D gross drug spending became increasingly more concentrated from 2012 to 2021, which was especially pronounced for specialty drugs. Increases in prices for specialty and other brand-name drugs will likely continue to drive gross spending upward.

While in previous decades the concept of smart city referred mainly to the digital and technological realm as an indicator of the performance of cities, today it is taking on a broader range of meanings, so as to also cover such areas as governance, environment, housing and people. However, the critical literature on smart cities highlights two potential disadvantages: firstly, that urban planners who decide to pursue a smart city vision run the risk of creating a kind of power and control over residents; and secondly that there appears to be an incompatibility between smart cities and the informal. Moreover, the spatial and the critical dimensions of the governance of urban smart projects are still insufficiently researched. By using a comparative and developmental quantitative methodology for the urban smart projects of Romania and taking the city of Timisoara as a case study, this study highlights the fact that large cities are not always the best represented; our findings show that peripheral small cities and towns may enjoy a more balanced distribution of smart projects. Furthermore, our evaluation of the spatial distribution (centre\u2013periphery) of smart city projects in Timi\u015foara\u2014a European Capital of Culture in 2023\u2014reveals a higher level of investment in smart projects in its urban periphery.

However, there are also feelings of disappointment related to the lack of cleanliness and the presence of an excessive number of stray dogs in the forests. The findings also indicate a necessity for the implementation of organized activities, such as sports competitions and more children-oriented events, while discouraging the organization of festivals and the excessive use of noise in forests.

We argue that in the face of this inaction, scientists can have the maximum amount of influence by lending their support to social movements pressing for action, joining as active participants and considering civil disobedience. Scientists seeking to halt continued environmental destruction also need to work through our institutions.

Disease status and change were analyzed by learning about the prevalence, death, incidence, DALYs (disability-adjusted life years), percentage change, and the estimated annual percentage change (EAPC). Results In 2021, there were 53,485 new cases of childhood and adolescent ALL, 23,991 deaths, and an estimated 1960,922 DALYs. Incidence, deaths and DALYs have declined globally, with only a rise in low-SDI regions. In 2021, middle-SDI regions have the highest cases of prevalence, incidence, deaths, and DALYs, accounting for approximately one-third of the global total. High-SDI regions have the lowest deaths and DALYs. East Asia has the highest prevalence and incidence. Australasia has the lowest death and DALYs. From 1990 to 2021, children and adolescent ALL deaths and DALYs show a declining trend in about 72.5% of countries, with only Sub-Saharan Africa showing an increase. The prevalence of ALL in children and adolescents is higher in males, with the highest cases in patients under 5\u202fyears of age.

This scoping review explores the extensive literature on PDI, spanning decades, regions, socio-political contexts, and disciplines, to identify barriers and facilitators of PDI implementation, providing researchers and policymakers with a categorization of these factors. To identify barriers and facilitators, three electronic databases (Medline, CINAHL, and Sociological Abstracts) were searched, yielding 2,250 references. After screening and reviewing, 52 studies were included in the final analysis. Thematic synthesis was utilized to categorize the identified factors, responding to the review question. The analysis revealed that barriers to PDI include inadequate planning, funding, and leadership, limited knowledge, competing interests, insufficient community-based alternatives, and resistance from the workforce, community, and family/caregivers. In contrast, facilitators encompass careful planning, financing and coordination, available research and evidence, strong and sustained advocacy, comprehensive community services, and a well-trained workforce engaged in the process. Exogenous factors, such as conflict and humanitarian disasters, can also play a role in PDI processes.

Data were collected through semi-structured face-to-face interviews, and analysed using thematic data analysis to develop themes and categories. Results The results of the interviews yielded two themes, healthcare needs and expectations of family members. The needs included physical healthcare, psychological healthcare, and social, financial, educational and spiritual needs. The healthcare expectations were divided into two sub-themes: (1) expectations from the healthcare systems, and (2) expectations from healthcare professionals. Conclusion The study showed that support from community members and healthcare providers could reduce the burden of care perceived by family members.

Patients (N = 214) were measured for distress, anxiety, depression, quality of life, level of functioning, and psychotic symptoms at admission, discharge, and 3\u2010 and 6\u2010month postdischarge. A multilevel modeling (MLM) approach was utilized to assess differences in changes from pre\u2010 to posttreatment.

Although organizations work to correct misinformation, challenges persist due to reasons such as the difficulty of effectively sharing corrections and information being overwhelming. At the same time, social media offers valuable interactive data, enabling researchers to analyze user engagement with health misinformation corrections and refine content design strategies. Objective This study aimed to identify the attributes of correction posts and user engagement and investigate (1) the trend of user engagement with health misinformation correction during 3 years of the COVID-19 pandemic; (2) the relationship between post attributes and user engagement in sharing and reactions; and (3) the content generated by user comments serving as additional information attached to the post, affecting user engagement in sharing and reactions. Methods Data were collected from the Facebook pages of a fact-checking organization and a health agency from January 2020 to December 2022. A total of 1424 posts and 67,378 corresponding comments were analyzed. The posts were manually annotated by developing a research framework based on the fuzzy-trace theory, categorizing information into \u201cgist\u201d and \u201cverbatim\u201d representations. Three types of gist representations were examined: risk (risks associated with misinformation), awareness (awareness of misinformation), and value (value in health promotion). Furthermore, 3 types of verbatim representations were identified: numeric (numeric and statistical bases for correction), authority (authority from experts, scholars, or institutions), and facts (facts with varying levels of detail). The basic metrics of user engagement included shares, reactions, and comments as the primary dependent variables. Moreover, this study examined user comments and classified engagement as cognitive (knowledge-based, critical, and bias-based) or emotional (positive, negative, and neutral). Statistical analyses were performed to explore the impact of post attributes on user engagement. Results On the basis of the results of the regression analysis, risk (\u03b2=.07; P=.001), awareness (\u03b2=.09; P<.001), and facts (\u03b2=.14; P<.001) predicted higher shares; awareness (\u03b2=.07; P=.001) and facts (\u03b2=.24; P<.001) increased reactions; and awareness (\u03b2=.06; P=.005), numeric representations (\u03b2=.06; P=.02), and facts (\u03b2=.19; P<.001) increased comments. All 3 gist representations significantly predicted shares (risk: \u03b2=.08; P<.001, awareness: \u03b2=.08; P<.001, and value: \u03b2=.06; P<.001) and reactions (risk: \u03b2=.04; P=.007, awareness: \u03b2=.06; P<.001, and value: \u03b2=.05; P<.001) when considering comment content. In addition, comments with bias-based engagement (\u03b2=\u2013.11; P=.001) negatively predicted shares. Generally, posts providing gist attributes, especially awareness of misinformation, were beneficial for user engagement in misinformation correction.

This is characterized by numerous crimes against civilians as seen vividly during the occupation of the town of Bucha where rape, torture, murder, and looting seem to reflect Russian military policy, leadership, and command guidance. Of particular concern is the threat to hospitals and health care as well as vital life support. Numerous hospitals have been damaged and destroyed. Hospitals are not tactical military targets and targeting health care facilities and personnel ignores traditional jus in bello and ignores numerous conventions established to stabilize the global order. The Russian-proclaimed \u201cspecial operation\u201d in Ukraine has been characterized by barbarian warfare in which the Russian military uses weapons against the civilian population and civilian infrastructure.

Restricted air space, limited possibilities for transportation of personnel and equipment, frequent interruption of power and water supply, and constant threat of injury to patients and medical personnel from missile and drone strikes, precludes reliable and safe delivery of tertiary care. The Canada Ukraine Surgical Aid Program (CUSAP) addressed these challenges by establishing a mobile craniofacial surgery unit, operating just outside of the war zone. The following report characterizes the civilian and military casualties, highlights the barriers to the provision of adequate tertiary care locally, and provides a detailed description of the measures that were taken to organize the mobile unit. The effectiveness of this program is documented, and specific challenges are illustrated through case examples.

In the Russia-Ukraine war, acute trauma care needs grew, the workforce was destabilised by HCW migrating or shifting roles to meet conflict needs, and facilities faced surge events. Chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and explosive (CBRNE) exposure risks created unique preparedness needs. In response, an academic and international non-governmental organisation partnership was formed to design, implement and evaluate a locally prioritised training programme in Ukraine.\n\n\nMETHODS\nSeven in-person training courses (Advanced Trauma Life Support, Trauma Nursing Fundamentals, Pediatric Trauma Fundamentals, Prehospital Trauma Fundamentals, Stop the Bleed, Mass Casualty Management and CBRNE Preparedness) were adapted, translated, taught and evaluated in seven Ukrainian oblasts (regions; Kyiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhzhia, Odesa, Lviv, Chernihiv and Mykolaiv) during the war. Topics were determined by available needs assessments and further adapted based on course participant feedback and evolving logistic and security challenges. Change in participant knowledge and confidence levels was assessed through precourse and postcourse knowledge and self-confidence evaluations and follow-up surveys. Initial courses were taught by international instructors and transitioned to Ukrainian instructors as they were trained. Web-based asynchronous videos in Ukrainian were developed to complement and reinforce in-person training.\n\n\nRESULTS\n4368 participants were trained in 164 courses from August 2022 to April 2023. 223 instructors were trained. Aggregate participant knowledge and self-confidence significantly improved in all courses. Interval follow-up responses indicated that the training was useful and 83.3% had used the skills within 8\u2009weeks of training. Twenty-seven training videos were created which, as of April 2023, have been viewed over 1\u2009700\u2009000 times in 500 cities throughout Ukraine.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nLocally prioritised training can be rapidly developed and delivered in an armed conflict setting providing civilians and frontline HCW with the skills and knowledge required to care for patients. Logistics, communication, equipment and security challenges can be overcome through strategic in-country partnerships. Short asynchronous video learning can complement and scale in-person training.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2025-01-02", "synthetic_support_claim": "Locally prioritised training can be rapidly developed and delivered in an armed conflict setting providing essential skills.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "The training program significantly reduced overall mortality rates among conflict-related trauma patients in Ukraine."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "ab871e70716cad645782921ce900c986037d8a0b", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ab871e70716cad645782921ce900c986037d8a0b", "title": "The origins of legitimation strategies in international organizations: agents, audiences and environments", "abstract": "\n How do international organizations (IOs) claim legitimacy, and why do they do so in different ways?

This article serves as an introduction to a special section on \u2018Legitimizing international organizations\u2019. It theorizes the origins of IOs' legitimation strategies and outlines the analytical framework for the special section. We propose the agents-audiences-environment (AAE) framework, which synthesizes diverse literatures on organizational legitimation. While existing literature focuses on audiencesapos; normative demands as a key source of legitimation strategies, we supplement this perspective with ones that consider IO agents' normative beliefs and the norms institutionalized in peer organizations. In this introduction, we first clarify what is at stake in the debate over IO legitimation. We then explain the benefits of shifting perspective from audience beliefs to the origins of IO legitimation. Thereafter, we define the main concepts and develop our AAE-framework. We conclude by summarizing how our contributors use the AAE-framework to advance our understanding of IO legitimation.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-05-02", "synthetic_support_claim": "International Organizations\u2019 legitimation strategies are influenced by agents' normative beliefs and peer institutions' norms.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "International organizations\u2019 legitimation strategies are primarily influenced by economic conditions rather than normative beliefs."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "c613b4c87d30de9befd0c0b292934a7bb4a07104", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c613b4c87d30de9befd0c0b292934a7bb4a07104", "title": "Leadership in international populism: How Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Hungary shows the way", "abstract": "Although a burgeoning literature explores the international dimensions of populism, we still know little about how populist leaders gain international popularity. This paper describes how Viktor Orb\u00e1n, the Prime Minister of Hungary, has emerged as the role model of international right-wing populism. It demonstrates that Orb\u00e1n actively supplied himself as an example that like-minded politicians should follow. We draw on the concept of legitimation strategies to illustrate why Orb\u00e1n markets himself as the leader of an international movement against liberal ideologues (Wajner, 2022). At the same time, populists in many countries have searched abroad for a successful model to follow. Orb\u00e1n\u2019s anti-migration policies and his defense of conservative family values constitute chapters of an illiberal playbook that right-wing populists are eager to implement. We use the concept of authoritarian learning to develop this demand-side perspective (Hall and Ambrosio, 2017).

Due to the rise of populism, the Trump presidency, and the renewed assertiveness of the emerging powers, various IOs have been challenged in ways that put their ability to perform core functions at risk. This book studies the responses of IOs to such existential challenges. It focuses on the central institutional actors inside IOs\u2014IO leaders and their bureaucracies\u2014which have a strong interest in the survival and well-being of their organizations. Presenting six case studies and drawing on more than 100 interviews, the book highlights the variation in the way in which these institutional actors try to cope with and counter existential challenges: Some fight tooth and nail to keep their IOs relevant, while other institutional actors are more circumspect in their actions. The book shows that institutional actors try to tailor their responses to the specific types of existential challenges, but their ability to do so depends on the quality of their leadership, organizational structure, and embedding in external networks. This book is thus about the IOs themselves. It is about those who lead IOs at the top but equally about the desk officers who keep the machinery running. By providing a view from behind the scenes, the book uncovers important processes about the survival of IOs and international institutions.", "publicationTypes": ["Book"], "publicationDate": "2025-01-23", "synthetic_support_claim": "Some IOs resist existential challenges actively while others respond more cautiously depending on specific factors.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "\"International organizations have universally failed to adapt to the rise of populism and emerging powers.\""}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "ab22acadca3c9495129be06af71770a2623b778a", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ab22acadca3c9495129be06af71770a2623b778a", "title": "How Much Should We Trust Instrumental Variable Estimates in Political Science? Practical Advice Based on 67 Replicated Studies", "abstract": "\n Instrumental variable (IV) strategies are widely used in political science to establish causal relationships, but the identifying assumptions required by an IV design are demanding, and assessing their validity remains challenging. In this paper, we replicate 67 articles published in three top political science journals from 2010 to 2022 and identify several concerning patterns. First, researchers often overestimate the strength of their instruments due to non-i.i.d. error structures such as clustering. Second, IV estimates are often highly uncertain, and the commonly used t-test for two-stage-least-squares (2SLS) estimates frequently underestimate the uncertainties. Third, in most replicated studies, 2SLS estimates are significantly larger in magnitude than ordinary-least-squares estimates, and their absolute ratio is inversely related to the strength of the instrument in observational studies\u2014a pattern not observed in experimental ones\u2014suggesting potential violations of unconfoundedness or the exclusion restriction in the former.

Sociologists increasingly turn to this strategy in settings where unmeasured confounding between the treatment and outcome is likely. This paper reviews the assumptions required for IV and the consequences of violating them, focusing on sociological applications. We highlight three methodological problems IV faces: (i) identification bias, an asymptotic bias from assumption violations; (ii) estimation bias, a finite-sample bias that persists even when assumptions hold; and (iii) type-M error, the exaggeration of effect size given statistical significance. In each case, we emphasize how weak instruments exacerbate these problems and make results sensitive to minor violations of assumptions.

By examining the case of rural electrification in the Global South, this opinion paper exposes the limits of this evidence-based policy paradigm. The electrification literature boasts many studies using the credibility revolution toolkit, but at the same time, several systematic reviews demonstrate that the evidence is divided between very positive and muted effects. This bifurcation presents a challenge to the science-policy interface, where policymakers, lacking the resources to sift through the evidence, may be drawn to the results that serve their (agency's) interests. The interpretation is furthermore complicated by unresolved methodological debates circling around external validity as well as selective reporting and publication decisions.
