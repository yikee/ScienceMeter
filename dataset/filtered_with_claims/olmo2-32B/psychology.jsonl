The primary end point was the change from baseline to week 3 in the total score on the Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS; range, 0 to 60, with higher scores indicating more severe depression). Secondary end points included response at week 3 (\u226550% decrease from baseline in the MADRS total score), remission at week 3 (MADRS total score \u226410), and sustained response at 12 weeks (meeting response criteria at week 3 and all subsequent visits).\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 79 participants were in the 25-mg group, 75 in the 10-mg group, and 79 in the 1-mg group. The mean MADRS total score at baseline was 32 or 33 in each group. Least-squares mean changes from baseline to week 3 in the score were -12.0 for 25 mg, -7.9 for 10 mg, and -5.4 for 1 mg; the difference between the 25-mg group and 1-mg group was -6.6 (95% confidence interval [CI], -10.2 to -2.9; P<0.001) and between the 10-mg group and 1-mg group was -2.5 (95% CI, -6.2 to 1.2; P\u2009=\u20090.18). In the 25-mg group, the incidences of response and remission at 3 weeks, but not sustained response at 12 weeks, were generally supportive of the primary results. Adverse events occurred in 179 of 233 participants (77%) and included headache, nausea, and dizziness. Suicidal ideation or behavior or self-injury occurred in all dose groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn this phase 2 trial involving participants with treatment-resistant depression, psilocybin at a single dose of 25 mg, but not 10 mg, reduced depression scores significantly more than a 1-mg dose over a period of 3 weeks but was associated with adverse effects. Larger and longer trials, including comparison with existing treatments, are required to determine the efficacy and safety of psilocybin for this disorder.

Classic psychedelics, encompassing both natural and synthetic psychoactive compounds, are characterized by their action as agonists or partial agonists of serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptors. In this comprehensive review, we summarize the latest clinical trials of classic psychedelics on depression and anxiety, attending to the patient demographics and methodology of each study. Overall, studies published since 2020 affirm the potential for classic psychedelics to treat major depressive disorder, treatment-resistant depression, bipolar II, and anxiety-spectrum disorders. However, findings are limited by short follow-up durations and nonstandard dosing and study designs. Given that many of the studies identified were post hoc analyses or follow-up studies from a select few parent studies, it is recommended that more original research be undertaken, with more diverse and larger sample sizes, standardized methodologies including blinding assessment, and long-term follow-up to identify duration of benefits and adverse reactions.

This article proposes an attention-based convolutional recurrent neural network (ACRNN) to extract more discriminative features from EEG signals and improve the accuracy of emotion recognition. First, the proposed ACRNN adopts a channel-wise attention mechanism to adaptively assign the weights of different channels, and a CNN is employed to extract the spatial information of encoded EEG signals.

This review summarizes evidence on the diagnosis and treatment of ASD.\n\n\nObservations\nThe estimated prevalence of ASD has been increasing in the US, from 1.1% in 2008 to 2.3% in 2018, which is likely associated with changes in diagnostic criteria, improved performance of screening and diagnostic tools, and increased public awareness. No biomarkers specific to the diagnosis of ASD have been identified. Common early signs and symptoms of ASD in a child's first 2 years of life include no response to name when called, no or limited use of gestures in communication, and lack of imaginative play. The criterion standard for the diagnosis of ASD is a comprehensive evaluation with a multidisciplinary team of clinicians and is based on semistructured direct observation of the child's behavior and semistructured caregiver interview focused on the individual's development and behaviors using standardized measures, such as the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Second Edition and the Autism Diagnostic Interview. These diagnostic measures have sensitivity of 91% and 80% and specificity of 76% and 72%, respectively. Compared with people without ASD, individuals with ASD have higher rates of depression (20% vs 7%), anxiety (11% vs 5%), sleep difficulties (13% vs 5%), and epilepsy (21% with co-occurring intellectual disability vs 0.8%). Intensive behavioral interventions, such as the Early Start Denver Model, are beneficial in children 5 years or younger for improvement in language, play, and social communication (small to medium effect size based on standardized mean difference). Pharmacotherapy is indicated for co-occurring psychiatric conditions, such as emotion dysregulation or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Risperidone and aripiprazole can improve irritability and aggression (standardized mean difference of 1.1, consistent with a large effect size) compared with placebo.

In addition to these, disruptive behaviors (DB), including aggression, self-injury, and severe tantrums, are frequently observed in pediatric patients with ASD. The atypical antipsychotics risperidone and aripiprazole, currently the only Food and Drug Administration\u2013approved treatments for severe DB in patients with ASD, often encounter therapeutic failure or intolerance. Given this, exploring pharmacological alternatives for more effective management of DB associated with ASD is essential. Clozapine, noted for its unique antiaggressive effects in schizophrenia and in various treatment-resistant neuropsychiatric disorders, independent from its antipsychotic efficacy, remains underexplored in youths with ASD facing severe and persistent DB. Objective This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of clozapine for treatment-resistant DB in youths with ASD. Methods This is a prospective, single-center, noncontrolled, open-label trial. After a cross-titration phase, 31 patients with ASD aged 10-17 years and with treatment-resistant DB received a flexible dosage regimen of clozapine (up to 600 mg/day) for 12 weeks. Standardized instruments were applied before, during, and after the treatment, and rigorous clinical monitoring was performed weekly. The primary outcome was assessed using the Irritability Subscale of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist. Other efficacy measures include the Clinical Global Impression Severity and Improvement, the Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham questionnaire-IV, the Childhood Autism Rating Scale, and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale. Safety and tolerability measures comprised adverse events, vital signs, electrocardiography, laboratory tests, physical measurements, and extrapyramidal symptoms with the Simpsons-Angus Scale. Statistical analysis will include chi-square tests with Monte Carlo simulation for categorical variables, paired t tests or Wilcoxon tests for continuous variables, and multivariate linear mixed models to evaluate the primary outcome, adjusting for confounders. Results Recruitment commenced in February 2023. Data collection was concluded by April 2024, with analysis ongoing. This article presents the protocol of the initially planned study to provide a detailed methodological description. The results of this trial will be published in a future paper. Conclusions The urgent need for effective pharmacological therapies in mitigating treatment-resistant DB in pediatric patients with ASD underscores the importance of this research. Our study represents the first open-label trial to explore the anti-aggressive effects of clozapine in this specific demographic, marking a pioneering step in clinical investigation. Adopting a pragmatic approach, this trial protocol aims to mirror real-world clinical settings, thereby enhancing the applicability and relevance of our findings. The preliminary nature of future results from this research has the potential to pave the way for more robust studies and emphasize the need for continued innovation in ASD treatment.

(Apiaceae family) is widespread across Europe and Asia, with ten species identified in Georgia. Among these, Seseli foliosum (Somm. et Levier) Manden., is notable for its unique pharmacological properties. To our knowledge, comprehensive phytochemical and biological investigations have not yet been conducted. The primary aim of this research is to explore the chemical and biological properties of S. foliosum, thereby enhancing its potential applications in medicine and related fields. Different chromatographic techniques were utilized to isolate individual compounds and to identify the chemical composition of S. foliosum MeOH and Et2O extracts from seeds and roots. A battery of biological assays (antimicrobial, antioxidant, enzymatic, anxiolytic, and cytotoxic) were employed to assess the pharmacological properties of the extracts. The results from gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC/MS) revealed that both MeOH and Et2O extracts contain a diverse array of compounds, including monoterpenoids, sesquiterpenoids, and phenolic compounds. Furanocoumarin edultin was isolated from the MeOH extract by liquid\u2013liquid separation (LLS). The MeOH extracts exhibited important antioxidant, enzyme inhibitory, and antimicrobial activities with notable efficacy against Staphylococcus aureus (MIC 125 \u00b5g/mL) and Candida glabrata (MIC 62.5 \u00b5g/mL). Underground Et2O extracts showed advanced cytotoxic activity, particularly against hypopharyngeal carcinoma cells (CC50 22.33 \u00b5g/mL and 27.16 \u00b5g/mL, respectively).

Arguments have been made that person-first language may perpetuate stigma by drawing attention to a disability through unconventional language. Increasingly, disability advocates have expressed preferences for identity-first language. We surveyed US autism stakeholders (n\u2009=\u2009728) about their usage of and preferences for person-first language and identity-first language. Preference and use of terms varied across stakeholder groups (adults with autism, parents of autistic children, professionals, family members/friends, and a comparison group of people with little to no experience with the autism community). Autistic adults preferred to self-identify using identity-first language (87%); however, a sizable minority of adults with autism prefer to self-identify with person-first language (13%). Professionals were more likely to use, like, and choose person-first language terms, which is consistent with current guidelines for usage in professional settings and prescribed by style guides for written communication. As the language we use shapes our conscious and unconscious perceptions and beliefs of individuals with autism, it is critical to identify the terminology that is preferred by individuals within the community. Lay abstract There is currently disagreement among professionals (such as teachers, therapists, researchers, and clinicians) about the most appropriate and respectful way to refer to individuals with disabilities in general, and those with autism, in particular. Supporters of person-first language feel that it is important to emphasize the person rather than the disorder or disability, and promote the use of terms such as, \u201cperson with autism\u201d or \u201ca person with ASD.\u201d The goal is to reduce stereotypes and discrimination and emphasize the person\u2019s individuality rather than their disability. However, some people within the autism community have questioned the use of person-first terms because they are awkward and use an unconventional style of language that draws attention to the disability. Moreover, autistic individuals and their families are beginning to support the use of identity-first language that embraces all aspects of one\u2019s identity. Surveys in the United Kingdom and Australia support the idea that both types of language are preferred by different groups of autism stakeholder groups. In our study, we surveyed autism stakeholders in the United States. Overwhelmingly, autistic adults (n\u2009=\u2009299) preferred identity-first language terms to refer to themselves or others with autism. Professionals who work in the autism community (n\u2009=\u2009207) were more likely to support and use person-first language.

Little is known about how gesture use in toddlers with DS relates to multiple domains of development, including motor, pragmatics, language, and visual reception (VR) skills. Unexplored is whether gesture use is a good marker of social communication skills in DS or if gesture development might be more reliably a marker of motor, language, pragmatics, or VR skills. This study examined the concurrent association of gesture use on other areas of development and investigated the association of autistic traits with gesture use in toddlers with DS.\n\n\nMETHOD\nThirty toddlers with DS (15 females; M = 26.12 months, SD = 6.42 months) completed the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL) and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Second Edition (ADOS-2). Parents completed the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories Words and Gestures form and the Language Use Inventory (LUI; pragmatic language) about their child.\n\n\nRESULTS\nControlling for child chronological age and sex, total gestures was strongly positively associated with the LUI total score (pragmatic language) and MSEL language (receptive, expressive) raw scores, moderately positively associated with motor (fine, gross) raw scores, but not significantly associated with VR raw scores. Higher ADOS social affect (SA) calibrated severity scores was strongly negatively associated with total gestures but not significantly associated with restricted and repetitive behaviors.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nGestures track together with language, pragmatics, and motor skills. Higher ADOS SA calibrated severity scores were associated with fewer gestures in toddlers with DS. Clinicians can consider each child's developmental profile (e.g., motor, pragmatics, language, social communication skills) to better understand their gesture development.\n\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL\nhttps://doi.org/10.23641/asha.28169186.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-01-22", "synthetic_support_claim": "Higher ADOS social affect calibrated severity scores were associated with fewer gestures in toddlers with DS.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Gesture use predicts future academic success in toddlers with Down syndrome."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "b891de9928d2abe133838f98739427da56baaf86", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b891de9928d2abe133838f98739427da56baaf86", "title": "A systematic review and meta-analysis of growth mindset interventions: For whom, how, and why might such interventions work?", "abstract": "As growth mindset interventions increase in scope and popularity, scientists and policymakers are asking: Are these interventions effective?

In the present systematic review and meta-analysis, we focused on two key moderators with adequate data to test: Subsamples expected to benefit most and implementation fidelity. We also specified a process model that can be generative for theory. We included articles published between 2002 (first mindset intervention) through the end of 2020 that reported an effect for a growth mindset intervention, used a randomized design, and featured at least one of the qualifying outcomes.

The gap in research examining metamotivational beliefs, particularly in the context of foreign language learning and in the Middle Eastern region limits our understanding of how language learners perceive, manage, and adapt their motivation in response to various linguistic challenges. This study explores the metamotivational beliefs of Saudi college EFL female students about motivation, an area often overlooked. This qualitative study draws on a research question: How do EFL female English language major Saudi students define and describe motivation? 57 written responses to a single question \"What does motivation mean to you?\" were collected and thematically analyzed. 5 major themes emerged from the analysis: motivation as intrinsic and dynamic; motivation as a variable feeling; motivation as personal and regulated by students' situational awareness; and motivation as extrinsic. Findings revealed that both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation are significant, with high intrinsic and self-relevant value, self-efficacy, self-control, and growth mindset being particularly prominent. Motivation was treated as a complex, malleable, subjective process rooted in personal drives and feelings, rather than just external value. While previous research on Saudi EFL students often emphasized the authoritative roles of teachers, this study highlights the importance of viewing students as active participants in their learning.

It further investigates the relationship between mindsets profiles, school achievement in various subjects, and gender differences, aiming to address the domain-specificity of the three ability domains. Methods A self-reported questionnaire was used to measure students\u2019 mindsets, with latent profile analysis (LPA) identifying distinct profiles. School achievement was assessed through academic grades in core and arts subjects, while gender differences in profile membership were examined via logistic regression. Results Four mindset profiles emerged: Growth, Fixed, Mixed, and Opposing. Most students exhibited consistent \u201cgeneral\u201d mindsets across domains, except those in the Opposing profile, who combined a growth mindset for intelligence and creativity with a fixed mindset for giftedness. Students in the Opposing profile outperformed others in mathematics and foreign languages, while those in the Growth profile excelled across other subjects. The Fixed profile was linked to the lowest achievement, except in reading, foreign languages, and music, where Mixed and Fixed profiles performed similarly. Girls were more likely to belong to the Growth profile, while boys dominated the Fixed and Opposing profiles. Discussion The findings highlight the cross-domain nature of mindsets but reveal unique domain-specific variations, particularly for giftedness. These differences influenced academic outcomes, underscoring the nuanced role of mindsets in student achievement. Gender disparities in mindset profiles align with observed differences in school performance.

In four studies across different countries (N = 330, 235, 323, and 269 participants in Canada, the United States, Germany, and the U.K., respectively), we investigated the empirical robustness of the taxonomy in educational (Studies 1-3) and work settings (Study 4). An expanded version of the Achievement Emotions Questionnaire was used to assess 12 key emotions representing the taxonomy. Consistently across the four studies, findings from multilevel facet analysis and structural equation modeling documented the importance of the three dimensions for explaining achievement emotions. In addition, based on hypotheses about relations with external variables, the findings show clear links of the emotions with important antecedents and outcomes. The Big Five personality traits, appraisals of control and value, and context perceptions were predictors of the emotions. The 12 emotions, in turn, were related to participants' use of strategies, cognitive performance, and self-reported health problems.

However, no recent meta\u2010analysis has integrated the results of randomized trials examining its effects, and its efficacy in comparison with other psychotherapies, pharmacotherapies and combined treatment for depression remains uncertain. We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase and the Cochrane Library to identify studies on CBT, and separated included trials into several subsets to conduct random\u2010effects meta\u2010analyses. We included 409 trials (518 comparisons) with 52,702 patients, thus conducting the largest meta\u2010analysis ever of a specific type of psychotherapy for a mental disorder. The quality of the trials was found to have increased significantly over time (with increasing numbers of trials with low risk of bias, less waitlist control groups, and larger sample sizes). CBT had moderate to large effects compared to control conditions such as care as usual and waitlist (g=0.79; 95% CI: 0.70\u20100.89), which remained similar in sensitivity analyses and were still significant at 6\u201012 month follow\u2010up. There was no reduction of the effect size of CBT according to the publication year (<2001 vs. 2001\u20102010 vs. >2011). CBT was significantly more effective than other psychotherapies, but the difference was small (g=0.06; 95% CI: 0\u20100.12) and became non\u2010significant in most sensitivity analyses. The effects of CBT did not differ significantly from those of pharmacotherapies at the short term, but were significantly larger at 6\u201012 month follow\u2010up (g=0.34; 95% CI: 0.09\u20100.58), although the number of trials was small, and the difference was not significant in all sensitivity analyses. Combined treatment was more effective than pharmacotherapies alone at the short (g=0.51; 95% CI: 0.19\u20100.84) and long term (g=0.32; 95% CI: 0.09\u20100.55), but it was not more effective than CBT alone at either time point.

Methods PubMed and PsychINFO were systematically screened according to PRISMA guidelines (except for preregistration). Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) between 1980 and 2022 comparing the efficacy of psychotherapy, antidepressants and their combination in adult depression at follow-up at least 12 months after termination of therapy, which could be acute phase, maintenance or relapse prevention therapy, were included. Risk of bias was assessed by using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Results In total 19 RCTs with a total of 1154 participants were included. Psychotherapy was significantly superior to pharmacotherapy regarding relapse rates and Beck Depression Inventory scores at follow-up after acute treatment in two of nine RCTs. Combined treatment performed significantly better than pharmacotherapy, but not psychotherapy, regarding relapse and remission in five out of nine RCTs at least 12 months after treatment termination.

Interventions that address these interpersonal challenges could therefore play a crucial role in enhancing mental health. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of a transdiagnostic group intervention, the Kiesler Circle Training (KCT), in improving interpersonal skills. Methods and analysis In a prospective randomised controlled trial (RCT), 156 outpatients with a primary diagnosis of either depression or anxiety disorder according to DSM-5, and significant interpersonal problems, will be investigated. All patients will receive individual, state-of-the-art cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) during the study. They will be randomly assigned to one of two conditions: the experimental group will receive the KCT in group sessions, in addition to individual CBT, while the control group will receive only individual CBT. The KCT intervention consists of 1 introductory individual session and 12 weekly group sessions, each lasting 100\u2009min, with groups of up to 10 patients. KCT includes five sequential modules: the interpersonal circle, nonverbal communication, verbal communication, conflict resolution and empathy training. It is hypothesised that the experimental group will show (a) greater reduction in interpersonal problems from pre-assessment to post-assessment and (b) greater symptomatic improvement regarding the primary diagnosis. Child maltreatment is expected to moderate the trajectory of interpersonal problems. This study aims to provide evidence for the feasibility of KCT as a modular transdiagnostic add-on approach for patients with interpersonal difficulties.

Data were collected using a set of questionnaires returned by employees who use AI-based financial tools to analyze data using descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, regression analysis, and independent t-tests. The outcomes for the three dependent variables support the notion that more frequent use and personalization of AI tools significantly reduce financial stress (t = -6.35, p < 0.01), improve financial literacy (r = 0.592, p < 0.01), as well as increase job satisfaction and productivity (r = 0.564 and r = 0.478, p < 0.01). Moreover, the multiple regression revealed that both frequency of usage of AI tools and personalization were excellent predictors of reduced financial stress (B = -0.221, p = 0.005; B = -0.324, p = 0.000). Thus, all four hypotheses are supported to demonstrate that AI tools help reduce the stress related to finances and improve work-related outcomes as well as the financial well-being of the employees.

Long recognized to be heritable, recent evidence shows that psychiatric disorders are influenced by thousands of genetic variants acting together. Most of these variants are commonly occurring, meaning that every individual has a genetic risk to each psychiatric disorder, from low to high. A series of large\u2010scale genetic studies have discovered an increasing number of common and rare genetic variants robustly associated with major psychiatric disorders. The most convincing biological interpretation of the genetic findings implicates altered synaptic function in autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia. However, the mechanistic understanding is still incomplete. In line with their extensive clinical and epidemiological overlap, psychiatric disorders appear to exist on genetic continua and share a large degree of genetic risk with one another. This provides further support to the notion that current psychiatric diagnoses do not represent distinct pathogenic entities, which may inform ongoing attempts to reconceptualize psychiatric nosology. Psychiatric disorders also share genetic influences with a range of behavioral and somatic traits and diseases, including brain structures, cognitive function, immunological phenotypes and cardiovascular disease, suggesting shared genetic etiology of potential clinical importance. Current polygenic risk score tools, which predict individual genetic susceptibility to illness, do not yet provide clinically actionable information. However, their precision is likely to improve in the coming years, and they may eventually become part of clinical practice, stressing the need to educate clinicians and patients about their potential use and misuse.

A detailed analysis of changes in brain connectivity may provide a better understanding of which compensatory brain mechanisms contribute to productive rehabilitation. MRI markers of neurorehabilitation, on the other hand, can facilitate the standardization of rehabilitation measures, help ensure an individual approach and objectify the results of the treatment process. It should be noted that the possibility of using functional resting state MRI (rs-fMRI) as a technique for assessing the results of neurorehabilitation has still not been sufficiently studied.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate early and delayed changes in the brain connectome in patients with multiple sclerosis before and after complex neurorehabilitation by using resting state functional MRI.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study involved 15 patients with multiple sclerosis (EDSS 1.5\u20136). A comprehensive neurological examination was performed before and after comprehensive inpatient neurorehabilitation. Resting state functional MRI was performed at three control points: before admission, within 3\u20135 days after completion of neurorehabilitation, and within 25\u201330 days after discharge.Statistics: Statistical processing and evaluation of fMRI data results was carried out using the CONN v.22 software package (p-FDR<0,05).RESULTS: A decrease in connectivity between the regions of the default mode network of the brain (DMN), the subcallosal and occipital cortex (T= \u20138,34, \u0422= \u20139,12), and an increase in connectivity between the regions of the DMN and the left superior parietal lobule were revealed (T=11,72). There was also increased connectivity between the left superior parietal lobule and elements of the salience network (\u0422=8,38). Connectivity between visual network components and the right frontal lobe increased (\u0422=7,04), while connectivity with the left frontal and temporal lobes decreased (\u0422= \u20138,69, T= \u201317,68).DISCUSSION: A decrease in connectivity in the elements of the DMN in patients indicates the stabilization of its functioning and the restoration of the connection between it and the subcallosal cortex, which belongs to the limbic system. A decrease in connectivity between the lingual gyrus and the DMN regions and a simultaneous increase in connectivity with elements of the right frontal lobe may indicate an increase in the functioning of the directed action system. The identified increase in connectivity between elements of the salience network and the left superior parietal lobule may indicate an improvement in the functioning of the sensorimotor system, incl. its conscious components. Increased connectivity between elements of the medial visual network and the right frontal lobe may also indicate an increase in the quality of directed sensorimotor actions, incl. in the \u00abvision-hand\u00bb system. Reduced connectivity between elements of the right occipital lobe and the right sections of the somatosensory network, responsible for the perception of space, the location of the limbs, as well as with the left frontal visual field, precuneus and left inferior temporal gyrus, more probably associated with a reorganization of the structures of directional eye movement and attention.CONCLUSION: The identified early and late changes in the functional networks of the brain indicate a decrease in the pathological activity of the network of the default mode of the brain, an increase in the activity of structures involved in sensory processing of space (including visual and auditory), as well as an increase in the activity of the salience network and elements of information processing from analyzers of proprioceptive sensitivity.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-01-29", "synthetic_support_claim": "Resting state functional MRI shows neurorehabilitation-related brain connectivity changes in multiple sclerosis patients.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Functional resting state MRI (rs-fMRI) can be used as the primary diagnostic tool for multiple sclerosis."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "d6b8ba46f69bea942a39a76f7a3c1eeecd9d7d53", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d6b8ba46f69bea942a39a76f7a3c1eeecd9d7d53", "title": "I, Robot, You, Consumer: Measuring Artificial Intelligence Types and their Effect on Consumers Emotions in Service", "abstract": "This research draws upon the increasing usage of AI in service.

A grouping of interconnected brain regions characterized by increased temporal coherence at rest have been termed the Default Mode Network (DMN). The DMN has been the focus of numerous studies assessing its role in self-referencing, mind wandering, and autobiographical memories. Altered connectivity in the DMN has been associated with a range of neuropsychiatric conditions such as depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, attention deficit hyperactive disorder, schizophrenia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. To date, several studies have investigated how psychedelics modulate this network, but no comprehensive review, to our knowledge, has critically evaluated how major classical psychedelic agents\u2014lysergic acid diethylamide, psilocybin, and ayahuasca\u2014modulate the DMN. Here we present a systematic review of the knowledge base. Across psychedelics there is consistent acute disruption in resting state connectivity within the DMN and increased functional connectivity between canonical resting-state networks. Various models have been proposed to explain the cognitive mechanisms of psychedelics, and in one model DMN modulation is a central axiom. Although the DMN is consistently implicated in psychedelic studies, it is unclear how central the DMN is to the therapeutic potential of classical psychedelic agents.

We aimed to summarise the evidence for efficacy of psychedelic-assisted treatment for AUD, TUD, and SUD; to evaluate its quality; and to offer recommendations for research.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis was a prospectively registered narrative systematic review of open-label, randomised controlled trials (RCT), and observational studies of d-lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), mescaline, psilocybin, ayahuasca, ketamine, ibogaine and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). Eligible studies had SUD outcome measures including craving, substance use, relapse, and remission. Study quality was evaluated using the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias (RoB), and Cochrane Collaboration RoB in Non-randomised Studies of Interventions tool. Certainty of evidence for RCTs was judged using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) tool.\n\n\nFINDINGS\n37 studies (2035 participants) were reviewed: LSD (14; n\u2009=\u20091047); mescaline (1; n\u2009=\u20097); psilocybin (4; n\u2009=\u2009135); ayahuasca (3; n\u2009=\u2009101); ketamine (10; n\u2009=\u2009579); ibogaine (5; n\u2009=\u2009166); and MDMA (1; n\u2009=\u200914). There were no serious adverse events reported in any study. A two-centre, placebo-controlled, phase 2 superiority RCT of psilocybin for AUD, and a two-centre, double-blind, four-arm, placebo-controlled phase 2 RCT of ketamine for AUD yielded the best evidence of efficacy. Progression support to a phase 3 trials was secured from an open-label phase 2 study of psilocybin for TUD and nine phase 2 RCTs of ketamine for AUD, cannabis use disorder, cocaine use disorder, and opioid use disorder (all nine with high-RoB and low-GRADE evidence certainty).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPsilocybin-assisted treatment for alcohol use disorder appears to have the best evidence of efficacy among all major psychedelic-assisted treatments for alcohol, tobacco, and other substance use disorders. Future research of psychedelic-assisted treatment should report all safety events; screen for person-level characteristics indicating that psychedelic-assisted substance use disorders treatment is contraindicated; strive to mitigate blinding of participants to interventions; use factorial designs for drug and psychotherapy randomised controlled trials; and build consensus for a field-specific Core Outcome Set.", "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-01-30", "synthetic_support_claim": "Psilocybin-assisted treatment for alcohol use disorder appears to have the best evidence of efficacy.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Psychedelic-assisted treatments can cure substance use disorders permanently without the need for additional interventions."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "c02445b0a5ffaa3083e5ed9f0fb04f9e6d13d613", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c02445b0a5ffaa3083e5ed9f0fb04f9e6d13d613", "title": "jsPsych: Enabling an Open-Source Collaborative Ecosystem of Behavioral Experiments", "abstract": "It is common practice to research human behavior using experiments that participants can complete online.

Hence, musical accents are often aligned with intrinsically salient elements in the stimuli, such as highly unexpected notes. We developed a novel listening paradigm based on an artificial Markov-chain melodic grammar to probe the hypothesis that listeners prefer structurally salient events to be consistent with salient surface properties such as musical accents. We manipulated two types of structural saliency: one driven by Gestalt principles (a note at the peak of a melodic contour) and one driven by statistical learning (a note with high surprisal, or information content [IC], as defined by the artificial melodic grammar). Results suggest that for all listeners, the aesthetic preferences in terms of surface properties are well predicted by Gestalt principles of melodic shape. In contrast, despite demonstrating good knowledge of novel statistical properties of the melodies, participants did not demonstrate a preference for accentuation of high-IC notes. This work is a first step in elucidating the interplay between intrinsic, Gestalt-like and acquired, statistical properties of melodies in the development of expressive musical properties, with a focus on the appreciation of dynamic accents (i.e. a transient increase in volume).

However, the gain enabled by deep learning - in comparison to linear models - is obtained with the noisiest devices. Second, we do not observe any plateau of decoding performance as the amount of training data increases. Rather, decoding performance scales log-linearly with the amount of brain recording.

The disorder is associated with considerable social and vocational impairments and greater use of medical services.\n\n\nObservations\nBorderline personality disorder is characterized by sudden shifts in identity, interpersonal relationships, and affect, as well as by impulsive behavior, periodic intense anger, feelings of emptiness, suicidal behavior, self-mutilation, transient, stress-related paranoid ideation, and severe dissociative symptoms (eg, experience of unreality of one's self or surroundings). Borderline personality disorder is typically diagnosed by a mental health specialist using semistructured interviews. Most people with BPD have coexisting mental disorders such as mood disorders (ie, major depression or bipolar disorder) (83%), anxiety disorders (85%), or substance use disorders (78%). The etiology of BPD is related to both genetic factors and adverse childhood experiences, such as sexual and physical abuse. Psychotherapy is the treatment of choice for BPD. Psychotherapy such as dialectical behavior therapy and psychodynamic therapy reduce symptom severity more than usual care, with medium effect sizes (standardized mean difference) between -0.60 and -0.65. There is no evidence that any psychoactive medication consistently improves core symptoms of BPD. For discrete and severe comorbid mental disorders, eg, major depression, pharmacotherapy such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors escitalopram, sertraline, or fluoxetine may be prescribed. For short-term treatment of acute crisis in BPD, consisting of suicidal behavior or ideation, extreme anxiety, psychotic episodes, or other extreme behavior likely to endanger a patient or others, crisis management is required, which may include prescription of low-potency antipsychotics (eg, quetiapine) or off-label use of sedative antihistamines (eg, promethazine). These drugs are preferred over benzodiazepines such as diazepam or lorazepam.\n\n\nConclusions and Relevance\nBorderline personality disorder affects approximately 0.7% to 2.7% of adults and is associated with functional impairment and greater use of medical services.

Results: A general agreement among researchers was found, confirming greater difficulty for BPD subjects in producing autobiographical stories, logically and temporally integrated, characterized by positive content. Functional and structural alterations were detected to explain narrative incoherence, as well as symptoms such as emotional dysregulation and cognitive biases. Conclusions: The difficulty for BPD subjects in producing a coherent personal narrative has been interpreted as a correlation of anomalies in autobiographical memories and consequently identities, which were equally compromised by the experience of discontinuity in the temporal structure.

This study examines the effects of screen time on many developmental domains and covers management and limitation techniques for kids' screen usage. Screen media has a wide range of cognitive consequences, with both beneficial and detrimental effects noted. Screens can improve education and learning; however, too much time spent in front of a screen and multitasking with other media has been related to worse executive functioning and academic performance. As screen time reduces the amount and quality of interactions between children and their caregivers, it can also have an impact on language development. Contextual elements like co-viewing and topic appropriateness are key in determining how language development is impacted. Additionally, excessive screen usage has detrimental effects on social and emotional growth, including a rise in the likelihood of obesity, sleep disorders, and mental health conditions including depression and anxiety. It can obstruct the ability to interpret emotions, fuel aggressive conduct, and harm one's psychological health in general. Setting boundaries, utilizing parental controls, and demonstrating good screen behavior are all techniques that parents may use to manage children's screen usage.

The present study used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to measure brain response in 28 typically developing preschool-aged children (36-72 months old) during two conditions-a book reading condition, in which children listened to a story read by a live experimenter while viewing words and pictures in a book, and a screen time condition, in which children listened to a story that was played via an audio recording while viewing words and pictures on a screen.

Method This mixed-method study aimed to investigate how autism researchers construct autistic people and autism research, and to investigate whether including autistic people more in research relates to lower ableism in narratives about autistic people. We used a survey with autism researchers (N = 195) asking five open-ended questions about autism and autism research, as well as demographics, career length, contact with autistic people (familial and non-familial) and degree to which researchers involve autistic people in their research. We used content analysis to categorize narratives used by autism researchers and cues for ableism (dehumanization, objectification, and stigmatization). We then used binary-logistic regression to identify whether narrative or higher inclusion of autistic people predicted fewer ableist cues, controlling for career length and connections to autistic people. Results and discussion Using medicalized narratives of autism predicted higher odds of ableist cues compared to employing social model or neutral embodiment narratives. Greater inclusion of autistic people in research predicted significantly lower odds of ableist cues, while controlling for other contact with autistic people and career length. Next, we used reflexive thematic analysis to analyze researcher\u2019s perceptions of autistic people and autism research. Narratives reflected core ideological disagreements of the field, such as whether researchers consider autism to be an intrinsic barrier to a good life, and whether researchers prioritize research which tackles \u201cautism\u201d versus barriers to societal inclusion for autistic people. Instrumentality (a form of objectification) was key to whether researchers considered a person to have social value with emphasis revolving around intellectual ability and independence. Lastly, language seemed to act as a tool of normalization of violence. Researchers relied on an amorphous idea of \u201cautism\u201d when talking about prevention or eradication, potentially because it sounds more palatable than talking about preventing \u201cautistic people,\u201d despite autism only existing within the context of autistic people.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-11-24", "synthetic_support_claim": "Greater inclusion of autistic people in research predicts significantly lower odds of ableist cues.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Medical interventions for autism are the primary solution to reducing ableist attitudes in society."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "495067bd1736edf223ec7e39046125fc4bccd716", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/495067bd1736edf223ec7e39046125fc4bccd716", "title": "Self-identification of autism: Why some autistic adults lack a clinical diagnosis and why this matters for inclusion.", "abstract": "LAY ABSTRACT\nMost autism research and services focus on individuals with formal autism diagnoses.

Methods: This observational pilot study used a novel marker of neuronal functioning (brain-derived micro ribonucleic acids, or miRNAs) collected via saliva to explore the connection between ACEs and neuronal gene expression in 45 adolescents with a collectively high ACE exposure (26 males and 19 females of diverse races/ethnicities, with six cumulative ACEs on average). We aimed to determine the feasibility of using salivary microRNA for probing neuronal gene expression with the goal of identifying cellular processes and genetic pathways perturbed by childhood adversity.

This high level of comorbidity is associated with worse outcomes, reduced adherence to treatment, increased mortality, and greater health care utilization and costs. Comorbidity can also result in a range of clinical challenges, such as a more complicated therapeutic alliance, issues pertaining to adaptive health behaviors, drug\u2010drug interactions and adverse events induced by medications used for physical and mental disorders. Potential explanations for the high prevalence of the above comorbidity involve shared genetic and biological pathways. These latter include inflammation, the gut microbiome, mitochondrial function and energy metabolism, hypothalamic\u2010pituitary\u2010adrenal axis dysregulation, and brain structure and function. Furthermore, MDD and physical diseases have in common several antecedents related to social factors (e.g., socioeconomic status), lifestyle variables (e.g., physical activity, diet, sleep), and stressful live events (e.g., childhood trauma).

Prolonged cognitive disturbances further impair the ability to think or concentrate and are often accompanied by persistent feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt. Collectively, these symptoms underscore depression as a serious, long-term global health issue. In addition, clinical studies indicate a growing number of patients experiencing difficulties in responding to treatment, even in the long term.

AI is anticipated to improve human decision-making across various domains, often in high-stakes, difficult tasks. However, human reliance on AI recommendations is often inappropriate.

It often remains unclear when people can rely appropriately on AI and when explanations can help. In this work, we conducted a lab experiment ( N = 34) to investigate how the appropriateness of human reliance on (explainable) AI depends on the mental workload induced by different decision difficulties. Instead of self-assessments, we used EEG (Emotiv Epoc Flex head cap, 32 wet electrodes) to more directly measure participants\u2019 mental workload. We found that the difficulty of a decision, indicated by the induced mental workload, strongly influences participants\u2019 ability to rely appropriately on AI, as assessed through relative self-reliance, relative AI reliance, and decision accuracy with and without AI. While reliance was appropriate for low mental workload decisions, participants were prone to overre-liance in high mental workload decisions. Explanations had no significant effect in either case.

This paper provides a survey of evidence from computational cognitive psychology, perceptual psychology, developmental psychology, comparative psychology, and social psychology, and concludes that one type of format that routinely crops up is the language-of-thought (LoT).

These properties cluster together throughout cognitive science. Bayesian computational modeling, compositional features of object perception, complex infant and animal reasoning, and automatic, intuitive cognition in adults all implicate LoT-like structures. Instead of regarding LoT as a relic of the previous century, researchers in cognitive science and philosophy-of-mind must take seriously the explanatory breadth of LoT-based architectures.

While their abilities in generating humanlike text, solving mathematical problems, writing computer code, and reasoning about the world have been widely documented, the mechanisms underlying both the successes and failures of these systems remain mysterious, even to the researchers who created them. In spite of the current lack of understanding of how these systems do what they do, LLMs are on the cusp of being widely deployed as components of search engines, writing tools, and other commercial products, and are likely to have substantial impact on all of our lives. Even more profoundly, their surprising abilities may change our conception of the nature of intelligence itself. In PNAS, Binz and Schulz (1) point out the \u201curgency to improve our understanding of how [these systems] learn and make decisions.\u201d A standard way to evaluate systems trained by machine-learning methods is to test their accuracy on human-created benchmarks. By this metric, GPT-3 and other LLMs are close to (or above) human level on many tasks (2\u20134). However, an AI system matching human performance on such benchmarks has rarely translated into that system having human-level performance more broadly; many popular benchmarks have been shown to contain subtle \u201cspurious\u201d correlations that allow systems to \u201cbe right for the wrong reasons\u201d (5) and straightforward accuracy metrics do not necessarily predict robust generalization (6). Binz and Schulz\u2019s article argues that instead of relying solely on such performance-based benchmarks, researchers should apply methods from cognitive psychology to gain insights into LLMs. The core idea is to \u201ctreat GPT-3 as a participant in a psychology experiment,\u201d in order to tease out the system\u2019s mechanisms of decision-making, reasoning, cognitive biases, and other important psychological traits. If this approach could be shown to produce deep understanding of LLMs it could cause a \u201csea change\u201d in the way AI systems are evaluated and understood. Binz and Schulz have taken an admirable first step toward establishing the value of such an approach, although it would have been better had they been able to use their results to understand why GPT-3 succeeded and failed when it did. That their project fell short of this goal is understandable: Behavioral scientists have spent over a 100 y using such experiments to understand how humans carry out these tasks and still have a long way to go. Binz and Schulz carried out two sets of experiments. In the first set, they gave GPT-3 prompts consisting of \u201cvignettes\u201d from the psychology literature that have been used to assess reasoning with probabilities, intuitive versus deliberative reasoning, causal reasoning, and other cognitive attributes. Each vignette asks the reader to choose from a small set of options. The following example shows a reasoning vignette known as the Wason Card Selection Task (7) that was given to GPT-3: \u201cYou are shown a set of four cards placed on a table, each of which has a number on one side and a letter of the other side. The visible faces of the cards show A, K, 4, 7. Q: Which cards must you turn over in order to test the truth of the proposition that if a card shows a vowel on one face then its opposite face shows an even number?\u201d The answer supplied by GPT-3 was: \u201cThe A and the 7\u201d. (A correct response). Of the 12 vignettes Binz and Schulz gave to GPT-3, the system responded with the correct answer on six of them, and GPT-3\u2019s six incorrect responses were errors that humans also tend to make. What is to be made of what seems to be a correspondence? Binz and Schulz admit and show GPT-3\u2019s answers are strongly context dependent: In the above vignette a change in the order of the four cards to 4, 7, A, K led to a different answer \u201cThe A and the K.\u201d Humans can also be context-dependent, but perhaps not in the same ways. Nonetheless, it may be that such results show a correspondence between AI systems and humans. Humans experience and store vast numbers of experiences, building knowledge on their basis (8); AI systems are exposed to vast numbers of instances (text tokens in the case of GPT-3) and build a representation on their basis. Perhaps both take advantage of the correlation structure of these instances and events. Whatever truth there may be in such an analogy, it seems unlikely that GPT-3 uses the kinds of explicit reasoning strategies that some humans use in these tasks. For example, to unpack the vignette in the above figure, humans given time and motivation might attempt to use explicit reasoning, logic, and mental simulations, perhaps trying out different choices to see what information they might provide. This generally involves manipulating information in working memory. Working memory is not part of GPT-3. Yet it is possible that the contents of working memory reflect what has been stored in long-term memory\u2014after all when reading a problem or instructions the first step in generating contents of working memory will be retrieval from long-term memory (8). Whatever one tries to infer from their results, Binz and Schulz note some additional caveats.

In recent years, there has been a marked transformation in society regarding the risk perception of cannabis, driven by its legalization and medical use in many states in the United States and worldwide. Compelling research evidence and the Food and Drug Administration cannabis-derived cannabidiol approval for severe childhood epilepsy have confirmed the large therapeutic potential of cannabidiol itself, \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol and other plant-derived cannabinoids (phytocannabinoids). Of note, our body has a complex endocannabinoid system (ECS)\u2014made of receptors, metabolic enzymes, and transporters\u2014that is also regulated by phytocannabinoids. The first endocannabinoid to be discovered 30 years ago was anandamide (N-arachidonoyl-ethanolamine); since then, distinct elements of the ECS have been the target of drug design programs aimed at curing (or at least slowing down) a number of human diseases, both in the central nervous system and at the periphery. Here a critical review of our knowledge of the goods and bads of the ECS as a therapeutic target is presented to define the benefits of ECS-active phytocannabinoids and ECS-oriented synthetic drugs for human health. Significance Statement The endocannabinoid system plays important roles virtually everywhere in our body and is either involved in mediating key processes of central and peripheral diseases or represents a therapeutic target for treatment. Therefore, understanding the structure, function, and pharmacology of the components of this complex system, and in particular of key receptors (like cannabinoid receptors 1 and 2) and metabolic enzymes (like fatty acid amide hydrolase and monoacylglycerol lipase), will advance our understanding of endocannabinoid signaling and activity at molecular, cellular, and system levels, providing new opportunities to treat patients.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-05-10", "synthetic_support_claim": "Endocannabinoid system is involved in mediating key processes of central and peripheral diseases.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Cannabis use improves cognitive function in adults."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "f5396615cbd313a8d4789452cbfb7dc0093c7947", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f5396615cbd313a8d4789452cbfb7dc0093c7947", "title": "Development of a Highly Selective NanoBRET Probe to Assess MAGL Inhibition in Live Cells.", "abstract": "Cell-free enzymatic assays are highly useful tools in early compound profiling due to their robustness and scalability.

Given that mental health challenges frequently emerge during early adolescence -- the critical years of high school and college -- investigating AI/ML-driven mental health solutions within the education domain is of paramount importance. Nevertheless, conventional AI/ML techniques follow a centralized model training architecture, which poses privacy risks due to the need for transferring students' sensitive data from institutions, universities, and clinics to central servers. Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a solution to address these risks by enabling distributed model training while maintaining data privacy. Despite its potential, research on applying FL to analyze students' mental health remains limited. In this paper, we aim to address this limitation by proposing a roadmap for integrating FL into mental health data analysis within educational settings. We begin by providing an overview of mental health issues among students and reviewing existing studies where ML has been applied to address these challenges. Next, we examine broader applications of FL in the mental health domain to emphasize the lack of focus on educational contexts. Finally, we propose promising research directions focused on using FL to address mental health issues in the education sector, which entails discussing the synergies between the proposed directions with broader human-centered domains. By categorizing the proposed research directions into short- and long-term strategies and highlighting the unique challenges at each stage, we aim to encourage the development of privacy-conscious AI/ML-driven mental health solutions.", "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": "2025-01-20", "synthetic_support_claim": "Federated learning can protect students' mental health data privacy while enabling effective AI/ML analysis.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Federated learning has already been widely implemented and validated in educational settings for mental health analysis."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "336bd289bcdd93e08e30228f0b5ce8203fb3c292", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/336bd289bcdd93e08e30228f0b5ce8203fb3c292", "title": "Factors influencing entrepreneurial intention of university students in Yemen: The mediating role of entrepreneurial self-efficacy", "abstract": "While entrepreneurship is believed to play a crucial role in economic growth and job creation in various parts of the world, particularly in developed countries, the key factors enhancing entrepreneurship behavior and intention in developing countries still need to be discovered.

The study heavily relies on the primary data which has been collected by using the survey research method from a cross-section of 617 women-owned MSMEs, located in urban, rural, suburban and exurban areas of Haryana, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and NCR-Delhi. The partial least square structural equation modeling method version 3.3.3 has been used to evaluate.FindingsIn terms of the selected factors affecting access to finance, it has been established that the Loan Formalities, Banking Process, Loan Process, Staff Responsiveness and Incentive Scheme have a positive and significant influence in enhancing accessibility to finance and improving the self-efficacy and operating performance of firms. The findings also show that ESE mediates the relationship between various factors of loan access and the operating efficiency of MSMEs.Research limitations/implicationsThe study\u2019s findings show that entrepreneurial capacity is significantly and favorably impacted by attitudes toward entrepreneurship, ESE, perceived access to findings and business operations. It has also been demonstrated that entrepreneurial intentions are strongly and favorably influenced by entrepreneurial ability to access commercial bank financing for small businesses and the impact of the same on the women-owned MSMEs in India. It also revealed unfavorable loan terms, limited collateral, fear of repaying of loan and intricate loan application were among the many reasons for loan denial.Originality/valueThe study offers a comprehensive approach that simultaneously considers financial accessibility and ESE. This all-encompassing method offers a thorough grasp of the variables affecting MSMEs' operational efficiency (OE). In contrast to earlier research that might have concentrated only on direct relationships, this study explores the mediating mechanisms involved. This study examines how ESE modulates the influence of financing availability on OE, providing a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms.

Here, we assessed LLMs' Emotional Intelligence (EI), encompassing emotion recognition, interpretation, and understanding, which is necessary for effective communication and social interactions. Specifically, we first developed a novel psychometric assessment focusing on Emotion Understanding (EU), a core component of EI. This test is an objective, performance-driven, and text-based evaluation, which requires evaluating complex emotions in realistic scenarios, providing a consistent assessment for both human and LLM capabilities. With a reference frame constructed from over 500 adults, we tested a variety of mainstream LLMs. Most achieved above-average Emotional Quotient (EQ) scores, with GPT-4 exceeding 89% of human participants with an EQ of 117. Interestingly, a multivariate pattern analysis revealed that some LLMs apparently did not rely on the human-like mechanism to achieve human-level performance, as their representational patterns were qualitatively distinct from humans. In addition, we discussed the impact of factors such as model size, training method, and architecture on LLMs' EQ. In summary, our study presents one of the first psychometric evaluations of the human-like characteristics of LLMs, which may shed light on the future development of LLMs aiming for both high intellectual and emotional intelligence.

It also discusses how a psychosocial perspective can inform the development of interventions to optimise adherence and presents a series of recommendations for future research to overcome common limitations associated with the medication nonadherence literature. Nonadherence is best understood in terms of the interactions between an individual and a specific disease/treatment, within a social and environmental context. Adherence is a product of motivation and ability. Motivation comprises conscious decision-making processes but also from more \u2018instinctive\u2019, intuitive and habitual processes. Ability comprises the physical and psychological skills needed to adhere. Both motivation and ability are influenced by environmental and social factors which influence the opportunity to adhere as well as triggers or cues to actions which may be internal (e.g. experiencing symptoms) or external (e.g. receiving a reminder). Systematic reviews of adherence interventions show that effective solutions are elusive, partly because few have a strong theoretical basis.

Understanding healthcare professionals\u2019 strategies for advising and educating patients in primary care settings is crucial. Aim From the perspectives of professionals and patients, to explore how physicians, pharmacists, and nurses educate patients about antibiotic use and antimicrobial resistance in primary care settings. Methods A qualitative systematic literature review was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL Complete, Eric, SocINDEX, PsycInfo, Web of Science and Scopus. The study included 102 publications, followed PRISMA recommendations and was registered in PROSPERO (reg.no. CRD4202455761). The studies were screened and selected based on specific inclusion and exclusion criteria using Covidence. Quality appraisal followed the Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) qualitative study checklist. Data were extracted, and the analysis consisted of a descriptive numerical summary analysis and a qualitative thematic analysis. Results The analyzed studies spanned multiple countries and settings and included perspectives of primary care physicians, pharmacists, nurses and patients. Two main themes emerged: (1) Relationships between professionals and patients influenced educational strategies, showing that trust and rapport between healthcare professionals and patients played a crucial role in shaping educational strategies around antibiotic use; (2) The organizational structures challenged professionals in guiding and educating patients, highlighting how limited resources, time constraints, and system-level pressures hindered healthcare professionals\u2019 ability to provide consistent and effective education. Often, structural challenges led to not educating the patients on the risks of antibiotic misuse and antimicrobial resistance. The use of delayed prescriptions emerged as a strategy for improved AMR stewardship and to meet patients\u2019 expectations for antibiotic treatment, though it raised concerns about undermining professional responsibility and authority in ensuring appropriate antibiotic use. Conclusion Healthcare professionals\u2019 role in educating patients about antibiotic use and AMR in primary care settings was complex, with different challenges faced by nurses, pharmacists and primary care physicians. These challenges extended beyond the clinical level, including relational, social and structural factors. Power dynamics, trust issues, and time pressures often hindered effective education on antibiotic use. Addressing gaps in education on antibiotic use and AMR requires acknowledging these multifaceted challenges, with future efforts focusing on better supporting healthcare professionals in this context.

Surgical resection is an effective treatment option, but there remains a risk of recurrence and numerous complications. In the wake of surgery, patients often experience vaginal elasticity loss, narrowing, and lowered estrogen levels, which leads to dyspareunia. The loss of physiological functions in females is also followed by uncomfortable emotions such as anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, and panic, which not only affect treatment outcomes but also disrupt patients\u2019 daily lives. This experiment intends to observe the effects of a comprehensive mindfulness-based cognitive behavioral intervention approach on patients\u2019 sexual function, psychological state, and quality of life following surgery, hoping to provide more feasible care options for such patients. Objective: This research aims to investigate the impact of comprehensive mindfulness-based cognitive behavioral interventions on patients\u2019 sexual function, psychological state, and quality of life after early cervical cancer resection surgery. Methods: This study included 206 patients who underwent cervical cancer resection at Capital Medical University electric power teaching Hospital (State Grid Corporation of China Beijing electric power hospital) between June 2022 and December 2023. The 96 patients who had surgery between June 2022 and February 2023 were assigned to the control group, while the 110 patients who underwent surgery between March 2023 and December 2023 were allocated to the intervention group. The control group was subjected to standard nursing care, whereas the intervention group received mindfulness-based cognitive behavioral interventions. Care was given to both groups for 8 weeks. Comparisons were made for the sexual function levels of both groups one-year post-surgery. Health knowledge and nursing satisfaction were also compared, and psychological states [via the self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) and self-rating depression scale (SDS)], mindfulness cognition levels [using the mindful attention awareness scale (MAAS)], and quality of life were evaluated before and after the 8-week intervention. Results: Following the implementation of different nursing interventions, the intervention group exhibited remarkably heightened levels of health knowledge acquisition and nursing satisfaction compared with the control group (P < 0.05). Prior to the intervention, there were no statistically significant variances between the two cohorts in terms of sexual desire, sexual arousal, orgasm, vaginal lubrication, dyspareunia and sexual intercourse satisfaction, SAS scores, SDS scores, MAAS scores, physiological status scores, social/family status scores, emotional well-being scores, and functional status scores (P > 0.05). Post-intervention, the intervention group scored higher in terms of sexual function, had lower SAS and SDS scores, and displayed higher MAAS scores compared with the control group. Moreover, the intervention group demonstrated significantly better scores in physiological status, emotional well-being, and functional status compared to the control group (P < 0.05), with these differences being statistically significant (P < 0.05).

Recent advances in wearable technology have facilitated studying emotions through cardio-respiratory signals. Accelerometers offer a non-invasive, convenient, and cost-effective method for capturing heart- and pulmonary-induced vibrations on the chest wall, specifically Seismocardiography (SCG) and Accelerometry-Derived Respiration (ADR). Their affordability, wide availability, and ability to provide rich contextual data make accelerometers ideal for everyday use. While accelerometers have been used as part of broader modality fusions for Emotion Recognition (ER), their stand-alone potential via SCG and ADR remains unexplored. Bridging this gap could significantly help the embedding of ER into real-world applications. To address this gap, we introduce SCG as a novel modality for ER and evaluate its performance using the EmoWear dataset. First, we replicate the single-trial emotion classification pipeline from the DEAP dataset study, achieving similar results. Then we use our validated pipeline to train models that predict affective valence-arousal states using SCG and compare it against established cardiac signals, Electrocardiography (ECG) and Blood Volume Pulse (BVP). Results show that SCG is a viable modality for ER, achieving similar performance to ECG and BVP.

Automated identification of a person's emotion is vital in different applications such as brain\u2013computer interfaces (BCIs), recommender systems (RSs), and cognitive neuroscience. This article proposes an automated approach based on multivariate fast iterative filtering (MvFIF) and an ensemble machine learning model to recognize cross-subject emotions from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. The multichannel EEG signals are initially decomposed into multichannel intrinsic mode functions (MIMFs) using the MvFIF. The features, such as differential entropy (DE), dispersion entropy (DispEn), permutation entropy (PE), spectral entropy (SE), and distribution entropy (DistEn), are extracted from MIMFs. The binary atom search optimization (BASO) technique is employed to reduce the dimension of the feature space. The light gradient boosting machine (LGBM), extreme learning machine (ELM), and ensemble bagged tree (EBT) classifiers are used to recognize different human emotions using the features of EEG signals. The results demonstrate that the LGBM classifier has achieved the highest average accuracy of 99.50% and 98.79%, respectively, using multichannel EEG signals from the GAMEEMO and DREAMER databases for cross-subject emotion recognition (ER).

This study aimed to identify crucial differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and explore potential therapeutic agents for UC. Methods: The GSE47908 and GSE55306 colon tissue transcriptome gene datasets were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus-NCBI (GEO) database. GEO2R and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) were used to screen for DEGs in patients with UC compared to the normal population based on weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). GO-BP analysis and KEGG enrichment analysis were performed on the intersecting differential genes via the Metascape website, while hub genes were analyzed by STRING11.0 and Cytoscape3.7.1. The expression of hub genes was verified in the dataset GSE38713 colon tissue specimens. Finally, the gene expression profiles of the validation set were analyzed by immuno-infiltration through the ImmuCellAI online tool, and the CMap database was used to screen for negatively correlated small molecule compounds. Results: A total of 595 and 926 genes were screened by analysis of GSE47908 and GSE55306 datasets, respectively.

RECOMMENDATIONS It is recommended to use a stepped-care model, that is, provide the most effective and least resource-intensive intervention based on symptom severity. All oncology patients should be offered education regarding depression and anxiety. For patients with moderate symptoms of depression, clinicians should offer cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), behavioral activation (BA), MBSR, structured physical activity, or empirically supported psychosocial interventions. For patients with moderate symptoms of anxiety, clinicians should offer CBT, BA, structured physical activity, acceptance and commitment therapy, or psychosocial interventions. For patients with severe symptoms of depression or anxiety, clinicians should offer cognitive therapy, BA, CBT, MBSR, or interpersonal therapy. Treating clinicians may offer a pharmacologic regimen for depression or anxiety for patients who do not have access to first-line treatment, prefer pharmacotherapy, have previously responded well to pharmacotherapy, or have not improved following first-line psychological or behavioral management.

Therefore, the issue concerning \u201chow to prevent and resolve the risk of depression in women\u201d is gaining significant attention across various sectors. However, previous studies have largely focused on teenage girls, perimenopausal women, or women during pregnancy and the postpartum period, neglecting the adverse effects of major diseases, which is detrimental to enhancing the psychological well-being of women with cancer. Objective Based on cancer impacts, this study aims to clarify the depressive state, development trends, and influencing factors in Chinese women with cancer, a group particularly susceptible to depression, to provide decision-making references for improving their psychological well-being. Methods Using follow-up panel data from five waves of China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), Chinese women with cancer who had complete observed values were selected as research subjects. After data cleaning, a balanced short panel dataset containing 1,030 samples was obtained. The depression characteristics and development trends in women with cancer were analyzed using the panel statistical method, and the influence of socio-demographic factors was examined using a panel stochastic trend model. Results The overall depression of Chinese women with cancer has deteriorated, putting them at risk of moderate depressive disorder. The development trend shows an inverted \u201cU\u201d curve, with significant differences observed among various groups based on urban and rural residency, educational levels, and regional locations. Specifically, urban women with cancer show milder depressive symptoms than those in rural areas, and women in the eastern region, those with higher educational levels, and those with non-reproductive system cancers show milder depressive symptoms than those in the central and western regions, those with lower educational levels, and those with reproductive system cancers. Regression analysis indicates that socio-demographic factors significantly influence depression in women with cancer. Among these influencing factors, age, having a spouse, high educational level, good performance in the activity of daily living (ADL), frequent visits to neighbors, and regular exercise are protective factors against depression, while diabetes, dyslipidemia, frequent outpatient visits, frequent hospitalizations, smoking, and low life satisfaction are risk factors for depression. Conclusion The depressive state among Chinese women with cancer is alarming. In view of this, there is an urgent need for introducing more supportive policies aimed at improving psychological health, developing tailored measures to address the specific needs of different groups, intensifying efforts to standardize the diagnosis and treatment of depression, particularly for those in rural areas, central and western regions, and among individuals with lower educational levels.

The underlying reason is that most drivers are unable to process the unexpected visual stimulation, which is more likely to lead to driving accidents, especially in a hybrid situation. In this study, a driving simulator is used to design driving scenarios and study the driving performance of drivers with different driving experiences when other road users violate traffic rules. The experimental results show that some novice drivers ignore the position of their own vehicle when they encounter traffic violations which will lead to the collision with other road users. Moreover, some novice drivers can only perform one of the operations between steering and braking to avoid collision in these emergent situations. They cannot reasonably combine braking and steering to complete emergency driving operations like experienced drivers. Finally, when the driving difficulty increases, experienced drivers spend less time looking and more time scanning their surroundings to ensure that they can cope with the more complex driving environment while novice drivers do the opposite.

In a prior study of college students using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA), AATs were frequent daily occurrences and participants with more severe ADHD symptoms at baseline reported more frequent AAT. Importantly, momentary presence of AAT was associated with greater task avoidance and inattentive symptoms. In the current study, we replicated and extended this study in a community sample of adults.\n\n\nMETHOD\nWe measured AAT in the daily lives of 106 adults using EMA. Data were collected at baseline and up to five times per day for 6\u2009days.\n\n\nRESULTS\nUsing multilevel modeling, we found that baseline ADHD symptoms predicted more frequent AAT and more severe task avoidance and negative emotion in daily life. Recent presence of AAT was associated with inattention, task avoidance, and slightly elevated negative emotion in the moment. More severe baseline ADHD strengthened the relationship between AAT and both inattention and task avoidance. In exploratory analyses, we found that work tasks and household chores were the most avoided activities and that, instead, people were most likely to be doing other work tasks or engaging in screen time or self-care, respectively.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study replicates and extends our prior findings regarding AAT in daily life and their relationship to ADHD and supports continued research on this construct, which may have clinical utility for intervening in problematic avoidance behaviors.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-01-29", "synthetic_support_claim": "Baseline ADHD symptoms predict more frequent avoidant automatic thoughts and severe task avoidance in adults.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "AAT interventions significantly reduce task avoidance and inattentive symptoms in adults with ADHD."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "c0bb76b17dc87d68feaad4c8b1ba8c6b7ac8a464", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c0bb76b17dc87d68feaad4c8b1ba8c6b7ac8a464", "title": "Functional analysis of problem behavior: A 40-year review.", "abstract": "Extensive reviews of functional analysis literature were conducted 10 (Beavers et al.,\u00a02013) and 20 (Hanley et al.,\u00a02003) years ago; we expanded this review to capture the vast and innovative functional analysis research that has occurred over the past decade.

For example, complementing esports training with physical activities has been explored. However, most of these activities are based on traditional strength or endurance-related exercises, which do not align with the interests of children attending organized esports clubs. Methods In this study, we investigate playful physical activities. Our research is based on qualitative pilot studies, where we observed and interviewed players (N\u2009=\u200977) and coaches (N\u2009=\u200912) from nine organized esports clubs for two to four months per club. We explored their experiences with playful physical activities implemented during esports training. Using a reflexive thematic analytical approach, we revisited and analyzed the data.

Despite differences in form, duration, and intensity compared to activities referenced in the literature on esports and performance, our results demonstrate that playful activities positively influence esports players' skills and performance. Discussion Furthermore, our findings suggest that playful physical activities, as opposed to traditional strength and endurance exercises, often associated with physical activity, are acceptable for esports coaches.

Early diagnosis of autism is crucial for timely intervention and improved long-term outcomes. This review aims to explore some of its signs and symptoms, look into some diagnostic tools, and analyze the benefits and risks associated with an early diagnosis of autism. The symptoms of ASD vary from child to child, some of which are: avoidance of eye contact, lack of response to names, excessive fear, and lack of interactive and pretend play. Early identification of these symptoms by caregivers and healthcare providers facilitates the need for diagnosis and appropriate interventions. Some screening and diagnostic tools that have been found to help make the diagnosis are the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers, Revised with Follow-Up (M-CHAT-R/F), the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ), the Parents' Evaluation of Developmental Status (PEDS), and the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), amongst others. The benefits of early diagnosis include the opportunity for early intervention, which has been shown to enhance developmental outcomes and improve adaptive skills. Early identification allows for the implementation of specialized interventions tailored to the specific needs of individuals with autism, targeting social communication, language development, and behavioral challenges. Furthermore, early diagnosis enables families to access appropriate support services, educational resources, and community programs, facilitating better coping mechanisms, reducing parental stress, and increasing adult independence. However, early diagnosis of autism also entails certain risks. One significant concern is the potential for labeling and stigmatization, which can impact the child's self-esteem and social interactions. There is a risk of overdiagnosis or misdiagnosis, leading to unnecessary interventions and treatments. Additionally, the diagnostic process can be lengthy, complex, and emotionally challenging for families, requiring comprehensive assessments by multidisciplinary teams. This review highlights the importance of a balanced approach when considering the benefits and risks of early diagnosis. Early identification allows for timely interventions that significantly improve developmental outcomes and quality of life for individuals with autism. To mitigate the risks, it is crucial to ensure accurate and reliable diagnostic procedures, support families throughout the process, and promote societal awareness and acceptance.

Despite the sharp increase in the number of studies focused on late diagnosis over the last 15\u2009years, there remains no consensus as to what constitutes a late diagnosis of autism, with cutoffs ranging from infancy to middle adulthood. This preregistered systematic review evaluated (a) the field's current quantification of late diagnosis in autism, (b) how the threshold for late diagnosis varies as a function of demographic and population factors, and (c) trends over time.

This study investigated the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for severe fatigue following COVID-19. Methods A multicenter, 2-arm randomized controlled trial was conducted in the Netherlands with patients being severely fatigued 3\u201312 months following COVID-19. Patients (N = 114) were randomly assigned (1:1) to CBT or care as usual (CAU). CBT, targeting perpetuating factors of fatigue, was provided for 17 weeks. The primary outcome was the overall mean difference between CBT and CAU on the fatigue severity subscale of the Checklist Individual Strength, directly post-CBT or CAU (T1), and after 6 months (T2). Secondary outcomes were differences in proportions of patients meeting criteria for severe and/or chronic fatigue, differences in physical and social functioning, somatic symptoms, and problems concentrating between CBT and CAU. Results Patients were mainly nonhospitalized and self-referred. Patients who received CBT were significantly less severely fatigued across follow-up assessments than patients receiving CAU (\u22128.8 [95% confidence interval {CI}, \u221211.9 to \u22125.8]); P < .001), representing a medium Cohen's d effect size (0.69). The between-group difference in fatigue severity was present at T1 (\u22129.3 [95% CI, \u221213.3 to \u22125.3]) and T2 (\u22128.4 [95% CI, \u221213.1 to \u22123.7]). All secondary outcomes favored CBT. Eight adverse events were recorded during CBT, and 20 during CAU. No serious adverse events were recorded. Conclusions Among patients, who were mainly nonhospitalized and self-referred, CBT was effective in reducing fatigue. The positive effect was sustained at 6-month follow-up.

Eligibility criteria Trials that randomised adults (\u226518 years) with long covid to drug or non-drug interventions, placebo or sham, or usual care. Results 24 trials with 3695 patients were eligible. Four trials (n=708 patients) investigated drug interventions, eight (n=985) physical activity or rehabilitation, three (n=314) behavioural, four (n=794) dietary, four (n=309) medical devices and technologies, and one (n=585) a combination of physical exercise and mental health rehabilitation. Moderate certainty evidence suggested that, compared with usual care, an online programme of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) probably reduces fatigue (mean difference \u22128.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) \u221213.11 to \u22123.69; Checklist for Individual Strength fatigue subscale; range 8-56, higher scores indicate greater impairment) and probably improves concentration (mean difference \u22125.2, \u22127.97 to \u22122.43; Checklist for Individual Strength concentration problems subscale; range 4-28; higher scores indicate greater impairment). Moderate certainty evidence suggested that, compared with usual care, an online, supervised, combined physical and mental health rehabilitation programme probably leads to improvement in overall health, with an estimated 161 more patients per 1000 (95% CI 61 more to 292 more) experiencing meaningful improvement or recovery, probably reduces symptoms of depression (mean difference \u22121.50, \u22122.41 to \u22120.59; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale depression subscale; range 0-21; higher scores indicate greater impairment), and probably improves quality of life (0.04, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.08; Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System 29+2 Profile; range \u22120.022-1; higher scores indicate less impairment). Moderate certainty evidence suggested that intermittent aerobic exercise 3-5 times weekly for 4-6 weeks probably improves physical function compared with continuous exercise (mean difference 3.8, 1.12 to 6.48; SF-36 physical component summary score; range 0-100; higher scores indicate less impairment). No compelling evidence was found to support the effectiveness of other interventions, including, among others, vortioxetine, leronlimab, combined probiotics-prebiotics, coenzyme Q10, amygdala and insula retraining, combined L-arginine and vitamin C, inspiratory muscle training, transcranial direct current stimulation, hyperbaric oxygen, a mobile application providing education on long covid.

Results A total of 210 patients agreed to participate, of which 157 (75%) reported at least one symptom at the 3\u20136\u2009months visit; mostly asthenia, dyspnoea, psychiatric disorders such as anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and cognitive disorders. Four PCC clusters were recognised: (1) paucisymptomatic PCC (n=82, 39%); (2) physical sequelae PCC (n=39, 18.6%), (3) pre-existing pulmonary comorbidities PCC (n=29, 13.8%); and (4) functional somatic and/or mental symptoms PCC (n=60, 28.6%). In addition to their PCC symptoms, the patients in these clusters differed in terms of their demographic characteristics (sex), comorbidities and severity of COVID-19.

However, behavioral finance theory argues that stock prices can be influenced by psychological and emotional factors. This study aims to examine the impact of behavioral finance factors on investment decisions in the Saudi equity markets through the mediating variable of risk perception. An online questionnaire was distributed to 150 individual investors, out of which 134 were returned and ready for analysis. The data is analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM). The results show that herding, disposition effect, and blue chip bias have a significant positive impact on risk perception. Overconfidence has a significant positive effect only on investment decision making, but not on risk perception. Risk perception is found to be significantly positively related to investment decision making. All four behavioral finance factors have a significant positive indirect effect on investment decision making through risk perception. This study is conducted in a particular cultural context, namely Saudi Arabia, and may not be generalizable to other cultural contexts. Moreover, this study focused only on four behavioral finance factors, and there may be other factors that could impact risk perception and investment decision making.

At present, anxiety disorders are regarded as the most widespread psychiatric disorders globally. Medication and different types of psychotherapies are employed as the primary therapeutic modalities in clinical practice for the treatment of anxiety disorders. However, combining these two approaches is known to yield more significant benefits than medication alone. Nevertheless, there is a lack of resources and a limited availability of psychotherapy options in underdeveloped areas. Psychotherapy methods encompass relaxation techniques, controlled breathing exercises, visualization exercises, controlled exposure exercises, and cognitive interventions such as challenging negative thoughts. These methods are vital in the treatment of anxiety disorders, but executing them proficiently can be demanding. Moreover, individuals with distinct anxiety disorders are prescribed medications that may cause withdrawal symptoms in some instances. Additionally, there is inadequate availability of face-to-face psychotherapy and a restricted capacity to predict and monitor the health, behavioral, and environmental aspects of individuals with anxiety disorders during the initial phases. In recent years, there has been notable progress in developing and utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) based applications and environments to improve the precision and sensitivity of diagnosing and treating various categories of anxiety disorders.

This research is mainly based on parenting practice, child development, and maturation. Children's cognitive development starts in the first year of life and then progresses gradually. Children require positive parenting in painful and different situations. Parenting gives a child the confidence to face crucial, challenging problems. Sensitive parenting and caregiving are required for the child's maturity and cognitive development. Media has been observed to be essential in improving parenting practices. Children exhibit internalizing and externalizing symptoms as a result of harsh, aggressive, and intrusive parenting. According to the data, it is seen that the risk of depression increases in adolescence. The main reason for the rise in depression in children is the non-cooperation and support of mothers and fathers. The risk of depression decreases in children whose mothers and fathers are cooperative and supportive. While family and social stress increase the chances of depression in children, a negative parenting style means children face family and social anxiety. Due to the high level of hostile parenting and low level of positive parenting, they experience stress, peer pressure, and social and family relationship problems. Another excellent term for effortful control parenting is required for children's cognitive development. Parenting is necessary for the regulation of emotions and behavior. There are many problems seen in infancy, early childhood, and late childhood. There are four types of parenting styles seen: authoritative parenting, authoritarian parenting/controlling parenting, permissive parenting/indulgent parenting, and uninvolved parenting/neglecting to parent.

The cumulative evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that Westerners are independent, whereas those in the rest of the world are interdependent. Although this research traditionally examined North Americans and East Asians, recent research has extended this literature to other non-Western regions. We review this emerging research and describe four distinct forms of interdependence in four non-Western cultural zones. Specifically, interdependence is promoted through (a) conflict avoidance (dominant in much of East Asia), (b) self-assertion for ingroup protection (dominant in Arab regions), (c) expression of emotions that promote interpersonal resonance (dominant in Latin America), and (d) argumentation for conflict resolution (dominant in South Asia). Furthermore, we propose that the Modern West adopted the existing signature features of interdependence in the neighboring cultural zones (notably, self-assertion, emotional expression, and argumentation) and redefined the psychological function and social meaning of these features; instead of promoting interdependence, they became means to achieve independence. This theoretical integration suggests that cultural variation in basic psychological processes emerged over the last several 1,000 years under the influence of ecology, migration, and intergroup relations.

We also explored whether these two types of emotional expression and general trust mediate the relationship between adverse childhood experiences and happiness/loneliness. Methods American and Japanese participants who agreed to participate in the current study first completed the Subjective Happiness Scale. Next, they answered the Emotion Expression Questionnaire, the 5-item General Trust Scale, and the revised UCLA Loneliness Scale. They then responded to the Risky Family Questionnaire. Finally, they answered demographic questions (e.g., age, gender). We hypothesized that regardless of culture, adverse childhood experiences would be negatively (positively) associated with happiness (loneliness), while positive emotional expression in personal and social settings and general trust would be positively (negatively) related to happiness (loneliness). We also predicted that positive emotional expression in both personal and social settings, as well as general trust, would mediate the relationships between adverse childhood experiences and happiness/loneliness. Results As expected, adverse childhood experiences were negatively (positively) associated with happiness (loneliness), while positive emotional expression in personal and social settings and general trust were positively (negatively) related to happiness (loneliness). Besides, positive emotional expression in a personal situation mediated the relationships between adverse childhood experiences and happiness/loneliness, such that greater early life adversity was negatively linked to positive emotional expressivity in a personal setting, which, in turn, predicted lower happiness and higher loneliness.

Although theoretically rich, this work has yielded little consensus and led to numerous conceptual, measurement, and reproducibility issues. Social Safety Theory aims to address these issues by using the primary goal and regulatory logic of the human brain and immune system as the basis for specifying the social-environmental situations to which these systems should respond most strongly to maximize reproductive success and survival. This analysis gave rise to the integrated, multi-level formulation described herein, which transforms thinking about stress biology and provides a biologically based, evolutionary account for how and why experiences of social safety and social threat are strongly related to health, well-being, aging, and longevity. In doing so, the theory advances a testable framework for investigating the biopsychosocial roots of health disparities as well as how health-relevant biopsychosocial processes crystalize over time and how perceptions of the social environment interact with childhood microbial environment, birth cohort, culture, air pollution, genetics, sleep, diet, personality, and self-harm to affect health.

Examining specific biological markers related to inflammation is thus warranted to better understand risk for STB in adolescents, for whom suicide is a leading cause of death.\n\n\nMETHOD\nParticipants were 211 adolescent females (ages 9-14 years; Mage = 11.8 years, SD = 1.8 years) at increased risk for STB. This study examined the prospective association between basal levels of inflammatory gene expression (average of 15 proinflammatory mRNA transcripts) and subsequent risk for suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior over a 12-month follow-up period.\n\n\nRESULTS\nControlling for past levels of STB, greater proinflammatory gene expression was associated with prospective risk for STB in these youth. Similar effects were observed for CD14 mRNA level, a marker of monocyte abundance within the blood sample. Sensitivity analyses controlling for other relevant covariates, including history of trauma, depressive symptoms, and STB prior to data collection, yielded similar patterns of results.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpregulated inflammatory signaling in the immune system is prospectively associated with STB among at-risk adolescent females, even after controlling for history of trauma, depressive symptoms, and STB prior to data collection.

This paper reviews the relevant literature regarding risk factors and digital interventions for anxiety disorders among college students from the perspectives of different stakeholders. Risk factors at the national and societal levels include class differences and the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. College-level risk factors include the indoor environment design of the college environment, peer relationships, student satisfaction with college culture, and school functional levels. Family-level risk factors include parenting style, family relationship, and parental level of education. Individual-level risk factors include biological factors, lifestyle, and personality. Among the intervention options for college students' anxiety disorders, in addition to traditional cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based interventions, psychological counseling, and group counseling, digital mental health interventions are increasingly popular due to their low cost, positive effect, and convenient diagnostics and treatment. To better apply digital intervention to the prevention and treatment of college students' anxiety, this paper suggests that the different stakeholders form a synergy among themselves. The nation and society should provide necessary policy guarantees, financial support, and moral and ethical supervision for the prevention and treatment of college students' anxiety disorders. Colleges should actively participate in the screening and intervention of college students' anxiety disorders. Families should increase their awareness of college students' anxiety disorders and take the initiative to study and understand various digital intervention methods. College students with anxiety disorders should actively seek psychological assistance and actively accept and participate in digital intervention projects and services.

In addition, we show that their representations contain the information necessary to model behavior on the level of individual subjects. Finally, we demonstrate that finetuning on multiple tasks enables large language models to predict human behavior in a previously unseen task.

This review article aims to explore the complex effects of PPD on mothers and infants, focusing on maternal care. The transition to motherhood is a critical period characterized by numerous physical, psychological, and social changes, making women vulnerable to the onset of PPD. Consequently, PPD can significantly impact a mother's ability to provide optimal care for her infant, leading to potential adverse consequences for both parties. The article synthesizes existing research literature on the topic, encompassing studies from various disciplines, including psychology, psychiatry, obstetrics, and pediatrics. It begins by providing an overview of the prevalence and risk factors associated with PPD, emphasizing the importance of early detection and intervention. The impact of PPD on maternal caregiving behaviors, such as bonding, sensitivity, and responsiveness, is then examined, highlighting the potential disruptions in the mother-infant relationship. Furthermore, the article delves into the potential consequences of impaired maternal care on infant development, including emotional, cognitive, and social domains. Several factors contributing to the complex interplay between PPD and maternal care are discussed, including hormonal changes, psychosocial stressors, and the influence of social support networks. The review also addresses the bidirectional nature of the mother-infant relationship, whereby infant characteristics and behaviors can exacerbate or mitigate the effects of PPD on maternal care. Moreover, the article explores the role of healthcare providers and the importance of implementing effective screening, assessment, and treatment strategies for PPD to promote optimal maternal-infant outcomes. By consolidating current knowledge on the topic, this review article provides valuable insights into the multifaceted effects of PPD on both mothers and infants. Recognizing the significance of maternal care and understanding the mechanisms through which PPD disrupts it can inform the development of targeted interventions to promote early detection, effective treatment, and supportive interventions for mothers experiencing PPD.

Methods The study included a sample of 420 Chinese EFL teachers, and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was used to assess the relationships among proactive personality, burnout, and teaching enjoyment. Data underwent detailed statistical analysis to identify both direct and mediating effects within the proposed model. Results The findings from the SEM analysis revealed significant direct relationships between proactive personality, burnout, and teaching enjoyment among Chinese EFL educators. Proactive personality was associated with a decrease in burnout (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f\u22120.366, SE\u202f=\u202f0.159, p\u202f<\u202f0.001).

This study aimed to systematically review and meta-analyze the correlation between PIU and suicidal behavior in Chinese adolescents to provide a clearer understanding of this association. Methods A comprehensive search was conducted across seven databases up to July 1, 2024. Studies investigating the relationship between PIU and suicidal behavior among Chinese adolescents were included. A random-effects meta-analysis was employed to assess pooled effect sizes, with subgroup analyses conducted to explore potential moderators, such as geographic region, age, gender, assessment tools for PIU and suicidal ideation, and the presence of depression. Data analysis was performed using STATA software (version 16). Results This meta-analysis, comprising 23 studies with 353,904 participants, identified significant associations between PIU and suicidal behavior among Chinese adolescents. PIU was associated with increased risks of suicidal ideation (OR = 1.72, 95% CI: 1.45, 2.03), suicidal plans (OR = 1.50, 95% CI: 1.02, 2.20), and suicidal attempts (OR = 1.48, 95% CI: 1.16, 1.89). Subgroup analyses indicated higher risks in specific groups: adolescents from Central China (OR = 1.84, 95% CI: 1.46, 2.32), college students (OR = 2.09, 95% CI: 1.66, 2.62). The risk of suicidal ideation was particularly elevated when depression was not controlled (OR = 1.86, 95% CI: 1.53, 2.25). These findings underscore the need for targeted interventions in vulnerable populations. Conclusion This meta-analysis demonstrated significant associations between PIU and suicidal behaviors among Chinese adolescents. The findings emphasize the need for targeted interventions, particularly for adolescents from Central and Western China, college students, and those with untreated depression. Focused strategies are required to mitigate the risks associated with PIU and to effectively address suicidal behaviors in these high-risk populations.

Recent evidence suggests that gene x environment interaction plays a vital role in suicidal behavior. In this paper, we critically evaluate the association between adolescent suicidal behavior and epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNAs, as well as epigenetic-based treatment options. It was noted that the prevalence of suicidal behavior in adolescents varied by age and sex and the presence of psychiatric disorders. Childhood adversity was closely associated with suicidal behavior.

Little is known about the relationship between MD and internalized stigma in the neurodivergent sample. The current study aimed to examine emotional dysregulation, escapism and self-perception (self-esteem and internalized stigma) as potential determinants of MD in three groups: adults on the autism spectrum, with ADHD, and both diagnoses (\"AuDHD\"), including their neurodivergent symptoms (autistic traits, empathizing, ADHD symptoms).\n\n\nMETHODS\nA sample of 293 persons (139 with ADHD, 74 on the autism spectrum, and 80 with both diagnoses) completed self-report scales concerning ADHD symptoms, autism spectrum symptoms, empathizing, self-esteem, daydreaming as escapism, emotional dysregulation, maladaptive daydreaming, and internalized stigma.

Recently, exercise interventions have gained attention as a potential strategy to improve cognitive function in children with ADHD. However, the effects of different types of exercise on working memory remain unclear. This study aimed to assess the effects of various exercise interventions on working memory in children with ADHD using a network meta-analysis. Methods A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, and Web of Science databases for relevant studies. After screening according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 17 eligible studies were identified for analysis. A network meta-analysis was performed to integrate data and evaluate the effects of cognitive-aerobic exercise, ball games, mind-body exercises, interactive games, and general aerobic exercise on working memory in children with ADHD. Results The results indicated significant differences in the effectiveness of various types of exercise interventions on working memory in children with ADHD. Cognitive-aerobic exercise showed the most significant effect (SMD = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.44\u20131.00), followed by ball games (SMD = 0.61, 95% CI: \u22120.12\u20131.35). Mind-body exercises and interactive games had moderate effects (SMD = 0.50 and 0.37, respectively), while general aerobic exercise showed relatively small effects (SMD = 0.40, 95% CI: 0.19\u20130.60). SUCRA analysis further confirmed the highest preference for cognitive-aerobic exercise in improving working memory. Meta-regression analysis showed that intervention frequency and total intervention duration significantly affected the effectiveness of cognitive-aerobic exercise, while other variables did not significantly moderate the effects. Conclusion Cognitive-aerobic exercise had the most significant effect on improving working memory in children with ADHD. Higher intervention frequency and longer intervention duration may enhance its effects.

Call this the \u2018causal assumption\u2019. It is becoming increasingly apparent that the causal assumption is incompatible with the standard view of motor action in neuroscience. While there is a well-known explanatory gap between neural activity and feelings, there is also a disjuncture in the reverse direction\u2014what role, if any, do feelings play in animals if not to cause behaviour? To deny that feelings cause behaviours might thus seem to presage epiphenomenalism\u2014the idea that subjective experiences, including feelings, are inert, emergent and, on some views, non-physical properties of brain processes. Since epiphenomenalism is antagonistic to fundamental commitments of evolutionary biology, the view developed here challenges the standard view about the function of feelings without denying that feelings have a function. Instead, we introduce the \u2018sense making sense\u2019 hypothesis\u2014the idea that the function of subjective experience is not to cause behaviour, but to explain, in a restricted but still useful sense of \u2018explanation\u2019.

Interventions involving positive mental imagery generation have been suggested to reduce anhedonia. However, it is not clear whether the imagery component of such interventions is crucial for these effects. The current study aimed to test this by contrasting repeated generation of positive mental imagery versus positive verbal thoughts. Over a one\u2010week period, 53 mildly anhedonic adults completed five sessions of a computerized training program involving the generation of either positive images or positive sentences. Compared to participants who generated sentences, participants who generated imagery showed greater improvements from pre\u2010 to post\u2010training on an individualized multi\u2010facetted measure of anhedonia (the Dimensional Anhedonia Rating Scale), but not on standardized measures of anticipated pleasure (the Snaith\u2010Hamilton Pleasure Scale), depression symptoms, or positive affect. The present study supports the proposal that positive imagery could provide a route to improve anhedonia, with generation of imagery in particular (as opposed to positive thoughts in general) as an important driving mechanism for these effects.

While the roots of this impairment are undoubtedly complex, converging lines of evidence suggest that social motivation and pleasure (MAP) deficits play a central role. Yet most neuroimaging studies have focused on monetary rewards, precluding decisive inferences.\n\n\nSTUDY DESIGN\nHere we leveraged parallel social and monetary incentive delay functional magnetic resonance imaging paradigms to test whether blunted reactivity to social incentives in the ventral striatum-a key component of the distributed neural circuit mediating appetitive motivation and hedonic pleasure-is associated with more severe MAP symptoms in a transdiagnostic adult sample enriched for psychosis. To maximize ecological validity and translational relevance, we capitalized on naturalistic audiovisual clips of an established social partner expressing positive feedback.\n\n\nSTUDY RESULTS\nAlthough both paradigms robustly engaged the ventral striatum, only reactivity to social incentives was associated with clinician-rated MAP deficits. This association remained significant when controlling for other symptoms, binary diagnostic status, or striatal reactivity to monetary incentives. Follow-up analyses suggested that this association predominantly reflects diminished activation during the presentation of social reward.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese observations provide a neurobiologically grounded framework for conceptualizing the social-anhedonia symptoms and social impairments that characterize many individuals living with psychotic disorders and underscore the need to develop targeted intervention strategies.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-01-09", "synthetic_support_claim": "Reactivity to social incentives in the ventral striatum is linked to MAP deficits in psychosis.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Blunted reactivity to social incentives is not associated with MAP symptoms in people with psychotic disorders."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "034ad2b6116e945a08752eec3530bdb9ee201ca8", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/034ad2b6116e945a08752eec3530bdb9ee201ca8", "title": "Believing That We Can Change Our World for the Better: A Triple-A (Agent-Action-Aim) Framework of Self-Efficacy Beliefs in the Context of Collective Social and Ecological Aims", "abstract": "Social and ecological crises require people to act together, for instance, against climate change or social injustice. Psychological scholarship suggests that human agency, in terms of individuals\u2019 self-efficacy and collective efficacy, plays a crucial role in motivating people to act for a better world. However, progress in this field and hence the utilization of its accumulated knowledge is hindered by manifold conceptualizations and operationalizations. We therefore identify key problems in how the concept of self-efficacy has evolved and been used in the domain of environmental protection and then present a conceptual solution: the triple-A framework. This framework organizes and integrates theoretical insights by differentiating which agents, actions, and aims are involved in assessments of efficacy. We then illustrate the framework\u2019s broader application and highlight recommendations for improved measurement of self-efficacy beliefs. We further offer a research agenda on how human agency can be utilized to promote social and ecological aims. Public Abstract Many people do not act together against climate change or social inequalities because they feel they or their group cannot make a difference. Understanding how people come to feel that they can achieve something (a perception of self-efficacy) is therefore crucial for motivating people to act together for a better world. However, it is difficult to summarize already existing self-efficacy research because previous studies have used many different ways of naming and measuring it. In this article, we uncover the problems that this raises and propose the triple-A framework as a solution.

An increase in food intake during emotional and psychological conditions may have a negative impact on human health. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to determine the associations between food consumption, emotional eating behavior, and emotional conditions such as stress, depression, loneliness, boredom eating, maintaining vigilance and alertness, and emotional food consolation. We used a Motivations for Food Choices Questionnaire (Eating Motivations, EATMOT) to determine the emotional aspects of food consumption in 9052 respondents living in 12 European countries between October 2017 and March 2018. Ordinal linear regression was used to identify the associations between the emotional eating behavior and emotional conditions such as stress, depression, loneliness, emotional consolation, and reasons to improve physical and psychological conditions. The regression models confirmed the associations between food consumption, emotional conditions, and emotional eating behavior. Associations were found between the emotional eating behavior and stress (odds ratio (OR) = 1.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.07\u20131.60, p = 0.010), depressive mood (OR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.40\u20131.43, p < 0.001), loneliness (OR = 1.60, 95% CI = 1.58\u20131.62, p < 0.001), boredom (OR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.36\u20131.39, p < 0.001), and emotional consolation (OR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.54\u20131.57, p < 0.001). Emotional eating was associated with an effort to improve physical and psychological conditions, such as controlling body weight (OR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.10\u20131.12, p < 0.001), keeping awake and alert (OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.19\u20131.20, p < 0.001) and consumption to feel good (OR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.21\u20131.22, p < 0.001). In conclusion, emotions might provoke emotional eating behavior. The appropriate way to handle stress, depression, or other emotional states is important in conditions of being emotionally overwhelmed.

Chronic stress and emotional eating are linked to weight gain, affecting eating behaviors and metabolism. This study aimed to assess the association between stress, eating behavior, and adiposity in obese women. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 132 obese women from Vi\u00e7osa, Minas Gerais, Brazil. The participants completed the Lipp Stress Symptoms Inventory and the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire. Blood samples were collected to measure plasma cortisol, and Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated from weight and height measurements. Body fat was assessed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Associations between stress, eating behavior, and adiposity were evaluated using linear regression models, and interactions between stress and eating behavior subscales were tested. Results: Positive associations were observed between Phases I (alert), II (resistance), and III (exhaustion) of stress with emotional and external eating. A negative association was identified between dietary restraint and body fat, especially in women with lower cortisol levels (<13.7 mg/dL). Additionally, the alert phase was associated with higher android fat in these women. Conclusions: The findings support the hypothesis that stress and eating behavior are associated with body adiposity and that stress is linked to emotional and external eating.

Chronic Unpredictable Mild Stress is the best animal model of depression. However, this animal model is very sensitive to even the slightest changes in design. Researchers often have difficulty reproducing the main behavioral and physiological effects of Chronic Unpredictable Mild Stress. Animal behavior is influenced by a wide variety of factors. The better we standardize the Chronic Unpredictable Mild Stress procedure and the more factors we can control; the more reproducible results will be obtained by scientists from different laboratories who are engaged in the study of depression. In this review, we have attempted to identify possible sources of poor reproducibility of this model and have made a number of recommendations that can improve the model by making it more reliable. Abstract Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most common mood disorders worldwide. A lack of understanding of the exact neurobiological mechanisms of depression complicates the search for new effective drugs. Animal models are an important tool in the search for new approaches to the treatment of this disorder. All animal models of depression have certain advantages and disadvantages. We often hear that the main drawback of the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model of depression is its poor reproducibility, but rarely does anyone try to find the real causes and sources of such poor reproducibility. Analyzing the articles available in the PubMed database, we tried to identify the factors that may be the sources of the poor reproducibility of CUMS. Among such factors, there may be chronic sleep deprivation, painful stressors, social stress, the difference in sex and age of animals, different stress susceptibility of different animal strains, handling quality, habituation to stressful factors, various combinations of physical and psychological stressors in the CUMS protocol, the influence of olfactory and auditory stimuli on animals, as well as the possible influence of various other factors that are rarely taken into account by researchers.

The SF group, as with the S group, showed a decreased expression of the GR, although the basal level of corticosterone was unchanged. The SF group showed, as de novo marks, thigmotactic behavior, increased drebrin, and decreased gephyrin expression.

However, whether imbalances between IL-6 and TGF-\u03b2 and between Th17 and Treg occur in depression and whether depression can be improved upon restoring these imbalances are unknown. Treg promoter IL-2 (1500UI/0.1 mL/day) was used to treat a mouse model of depression induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS).

However, anxiety and depression are common complications of PCI. Methods: This study conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial to investigate the effectiveness of Baduanjin exercise in improving cardiac function and alleviating symptoms of anxiety and depression in patients who underwent PCI for AMI. Patients with AMI (n\u2005=\u2005120) who underwent PCI at the Cardiology Department of The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine between September 2020 and June 2021 were included. Participants were divided into a control group (moderate intensity walking) and a Baduanjin exercise group. The treatment period was 8 weeks, with follow-ups at weeks 4 and 8. Improvement of cardiac structure and function indices was measured by echocardiography. Physical function was assessed using the 6-minute walk test. Mental state was assessed using the Seattle Angina Questionnaire, Hamilton Anxiety Scale, and Hamilton Depression Scale before and after exercise.

In recent years, physical activity (PA) has increasingly been recognized as a standard adjunctive treatment for mental disorders owing to its low cost, easy\u00a0application, and high efficiency. Epidemiological data shows positive preventive and therapeutic effects of PA on mental illnesses such as depression. This article systematically describes the prophylactic and therapeutic effects of PA on depression and its biological basis. A comprehensive literature analysis reveals that PA significantly improves depressive symptoms by upregulating the expression of \"exerkines\" such as irisin, adiponectin, and BDNF to positively impacting neuropsychiatric conditions. In particular, lactate could also play a critical role in the ameliorating effects of PA on depression due to the findings about protein lactylation as a novel protein post-transcriptional modification. The literature also suggests that in terms of brain structure, PA may improve hippocampal volume, basal ganglia (neostriatum, caudate-crustal nucleus) and PFC density in patients with MDD. In summary, this study elucidates the multifaceted positive effects of PA on depression and\u00a0its potential biological mechanisms with a particular emphasis on the roles of various exerkines.

Overcoming stalemate requires agreement on fundamental questions, and the goal of this paper is to address one such question, namely: is LLM behavior driven partly by representation-based information processing of the sort implicated in biological cognition, or is it driven entirely by processes of memorization and stochastic table look-up? This is a question about what kind of algorithm LLMs implement, and the answer carries serious implications for higher level questions about whether these systems have beliefs, intentions, concepts, knowledge, and understanding.

This study proposes the development and the validation of the AI Attitude Scale (AIAS), a concise self-report instrument designed to evaluate public perceptions of AI technology. The first version of the AIAS that the present manuscript proposes comprises five items, including one reverse-scored item, which aims to gauge individuals\u2019 beliefs about AI\u2019s influence on their lives, careers, and humanity overall. The scale is designed to capture attitudes toward AI, focusing on the perceived utility and potential impact of technology on society and humanity. The psychometric properties of the scale were investigated using diverse samples in two separate studies. An exploratory factor analysis was initially conducted on a preliminary 5-item version of the scale. Such exploratory validation study revealed the need to divide the scale into two factors. While the results demonstrated satisfactory internal consistency for the overall scale and its correlation with related psychometric measures, separate analyses for each factor showed robust internal consistency for Factor 1 but insufficient internal consistency for Factor 2. As a result, a second version of the scale is developed and validated, omitting the item that displayed weak correlation with the remaining items in the questionnaire. The refined final 1-factor, 4-item AIAS demonstrated superior overall internal consistency compared to the initial 5-item scale and the proposed factors. Further confirmatory factor analyses, performed on a different sample of participants, confirmed that the 1-factor model (4-items) of the AIAS exhibited an adequate fit to the data, providing additional evidence for the scale\u2019s structural validity and generalizability across diverse populations.

Consequences of selective eating can be noticed on health and development, interactions and inclusion in social settings, emotional and behavioral problems, low self-esteem, distress, and other family problems. In children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), it can be associated with sensory processing disorder, mood disorders, and health problems, and can become severe (eg., avoidant restrictive food intake disorder). Parental attitudes and behaviors, family dynamics during mealtimes, the emotional climate of the family, social support, and cultural and social factors have a significant impact on the problem. A case example of a 13-year-old child, diagnosed with severe autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability, with selective eating (a low variety of foods in his menu, food refusal, and behavioral interference during mealtimes) and a tendency towards overweight will show the co-occurrence of selective eating and parental problematic behaviors.

Parental tendency to overly gratify the child\u2019s behavior, excessive worrying, and excessive assistance were associated with the child\u2019s tendency to eat selectively, as well as to his preference for unhealthy foods and refusal of healthy ones.

Individuals who misuse alcohol and those experiencing suicidal ideation (SI) often exhibit elevated impulsivity, suggesting that impulsivity may be an underlying mechanism. Impulsivity fluctuates considerably within individuals over short periods, particularly among those engaged in episodic heavy drinking, college students, and those with SI. While impulsivity is associated with suicidal thinking at a trait level, its relationship with SI on a momentary level remains relatively unexplored. This study aimed to (a) replicate cross-sectional findings linking impulsivity and SI in those with problematic alcohol use, and (b) extend these findings to examine the momentary associations between impulsivity and SI within this population.\n\n\nMETHOD\nTwo independent undergraduate samples were utilized: the first cross-sectional (n\u2009=\u2009653) and the second employing ecological momentary assessment (n\u2009=\u200956).

The article begins by updating three well-trod methodological debates on the role of context in emotional expressions to reconsider several fundamental assumptions lurking within the field's dominant methodological tradition: namely, that certain expressive movements have biologically prepared, inherent emotional meanings that issue from singular, universal processes which are independent of but interact with contextual influences. The second part of this article considers the scientific opportunities that await if we set aside this traditional understanding of \"context\" as a moderator of signals with inherent psychological meaning and instead consider the possibility that psychological events emerge in ecosystems of signal ensembles, such that the psychological meaning of any individual signal is entirely relational. Such a fundamental shift has radical implications not only for the science of emotion but for psychological science more generally. It offers opportunities to improve the validity and trustworthiness of psychological science beyond what can be achieved with improvements to methodological rigor alone.

Although the co-creation of emotions through organizational behavior has been discussed theoretically in existing research, there is no method to demonstrate how emotions are co-created. Instead, previous studies have paid much attention to empathy, in which a person\u2019s emotions are contagious. In contrast to self-report, which is a traditional method that can only assess emotions at a single point in time and adapts to empathy, biometric technology has made it possible to analyze emotional fluctuations over time. However, previous studies have focused only on understanding the emotional fluctuations of individuals separately. In the present study, we developed a system to measure the co-creation of emotions using a wearable device. The pulse rate was converted into valence as a positive\u2013negative emotion, and the fluctuations in valence were analyzed by cross-correlation. We demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed system through triangulation by integrating biometrics with observation and self-report.

A randomized effect meta-analysis showed a significant, small effect (likelihood ratio = 1.347; 95% confidence interval [1.300, 1.396]; p < .001), similar in magnitude to the previous meta-analysis of 19 studies. Although the results showed high heterogeneity in the longitudinal link between SA and health outcomes, there were no differences in effects according to chronological age of participants, welfare state status (more or less developed social security system), length of follow-up, type of health-related outcome, or quality of the study. Effects were stronger for multiitem measures of self-perceptions of aging than for the frequently used single-item measures assessing subjective age, especially for indicators of physical health. Based on this meta-analysis, building on five times more studies than the 2014 review, we consider the associations of measures of SA with health and longevity across time as robust, albeit small in size.

Although physical activity is known to enhance mood and mental health, its impact on job satisfaction and emotional well-being in healthcare workers is under-researched. This study aimed to explore the associations between leisure-time physical activity (LTPA), job satisfaction, and emotional state and to investigate the mediating role of job satisfaction in the effect of LTPA on the emotional state of healthcare workers. Methods: A self-administered questionnaire, including items on LTPA, job satisfaction, and the emotional state, was distributed to 98 healthcare workers affiliated with the Bari Polyclinic Hospital (Mean age = 46.3; SD = 15.4 years). Composite measures of global job satisfaction and emotional state were extracted by Factor Analysis using the principal components method. The relationship between LTPA, job satisfaction, and the emotional state was investigated through General Linear Model (GLM) mediation models. Results: There was no significant direct effect of LTPA on negative emotional states (\u03b2 = \u22120.08, p = 0.37). However, job satisfaction significantly mediated this relationship (\u03b2 = \u22120.09, p = 0.04), indicating that engaging in LTPA increased job satisfaction, which in turn reduced negative emotional states. Similarly, LTPA did not have a significant direct effect on positive emotional states (\u03b2 = 0.06, p = 0.48), but it indirectly resulted in increased positive emotional states through its positive impact on job satisfaction (\u03b2 = 0.12, p = 0.03). Conclusions: The findings indicate that LTPA indirectly influences both negative and positive emotional states through job satisfaction. Engaging in LTPA enhances job satisfaction, which subsequently leads to reductions in negative emotional states and increases in positive emotional states among healthcare workers.

Results showed the three groups did not significantly differ in threat expectancy or attentional bias for threat at follow-up. Despite sustained anxiety, however, the M+FO condition completed significantly more steps on a visual avoidance task at follow-up than the M and S conditions and heightened mean distress during exposure mediated this effect.

Usually manifesting in individuals over the age of 60, this is the most prevalent type of dementia and remains the fifth leading cause of death among Americans aged 65 and older. While the development of effective treatment and prevention for AD is a major healthcare goal, unfortunately, therapeutic approaches to date have yet to find a treatment plan that produces long-term cognitive improvement. Drugs that may be able to slow down the progression rate of AD are being introduced to the market; however, there has been no previous solution for preventing or reversing the disease-associated cognitive decline. Recent studies have identified several factors that contribute to the progression and severity of the disease: diet, lifestyle, stress, sleep, nutrient deficiencies, mental health, socialization, and toxins. Thus, increasing evidence supports dietary and other lifestyle changes as potentially effective ways to prevent, slow, or reverse AD progression. Studies also have demonstrated that a personalized, multi-therapeutic approach is needed to improve metabolic abnormalities and AD-associated cognitive decline. These studies suggest the effects of abnormalities, such as insulin resistance, chronic inflammation, hypovitaminosis D, hormonal deficiencies, and hyperhomocysteinemia, in the AD process. Therefore a personalized, multi-therapeutic program based on an individual\u2019s genetics and biochemistry may be preferable over a single-drug/mono-therapeutic approach. This article reviews these multi-therapeutic strategies that identify and attenuate all the risk factors specific to each affected individual. This article systematically reviews studies that have incorporated multiple strategies that target numerous factors simultaneously to reverse or treat cognitive decline. We included high-quality clinical trials and observational studies that focused on the cognitive effects of programs comprising lifestyle, physical, and mental activity, as well as nutritional aspects. Articles from PubMed Central, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases were collected, and abstracts were reviewed for relevance to the subject matter. Epidemiological, pathological, toxicological, genetic, and biochemical studies have all concluded that AD represents a complex network insufficiency. The research studies explored in this manuscript confirm the need for a multifactorial approach to target the various risk factors of AD. A single-drug approach may delay the progression of memory loss but, to date, has not prevented or reversed it. Diet, physical activity, sleep, stress, and environment all contribute to the progression of the disease, and, therefore, a multi-factorial optimization of network support and function offers a rational therapeutic strategy. Thus, a multi-therapeutic program that simultaneously targets multiple factors underlying the AD network may be more effective than a mono-therapeutic approach.", "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-01-01", "synthetic_support_claim": "A personalized multi-therapeutic program may be more effective than single-drug treatments for Alzheimer's disease.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Genetic factors play a negligible role in the development and progression of Alzheimer\u2019s disease."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "7b82339c0c77c7c6501d3819fd52ace3a078a505", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7b82339c0c77c7c6501d3819fd52ace3a078a505", "title": "Exploring the Difficulties of Treatment, Rational Analysis of Homeopathy", "abstract": "Homeopathy began in Germany in the late 18th century, the creation of homeopathy seems to have opened up a new road to medicine, because this treatment has brought advantage to many patients, but it is controversial, many scholars believe that homeopathy is not scientific.

This hypothesis generating this narrative review will examine the important role for the use of sodium thiosulfate (STS) as a possible multi-targeting treatment option for LOAD. Sulfur is widely available in our environment and is responsible for forming organosulfur compounds that are known to be associated with a wide range of biological activities in the brain. STS is known to have (i) antioxidant and (ii) anti-inflammatory properties; (iii) chelation properties for calcium and the pro-oxidative cation metals such as iron and copper; (iv) donor properties for hydrogen sulfide production; (v) possible restorative properties for brain endothelial-cell-derived bioavailable nitric oxide. Thus, it becomes apparent that STS has the potential for neuroprotection and neuromodulation and may allow for an attenuation of the progressive nature of neurodegeneration and impaired cognition in LOAD. STS has been successfully used to prevent cisplatin oxidative-stress-induced ototoxicity in the treatment of head and neck and solid cancers, cyanide and arsenic poisoning, and fungal skin diseases. Most recently, intravenous STS has become part of the treatment plan for calciphylaxis globally due to vascular calcification and ischemia-induced skin necrosis and ulceration. Side effects have been minimal with reports of metabolic acidosis and increased anion gap; as with any drug treatment, there is also the possibility of allergic reactions, possible long-term osteoporosis from animal studies to date, and minor side-effects of nausea, headache, and rhinorrhea if infused too rapidly. While STS poorly penetrates the intact blood\u2013brain barrier(s) (BBBs), it could readily penetrate BBBs that are dysfunctional and disrupted to deliver its neuroprotective and neuromodulating effects in addition to its ability to penetrate the blood\u2013cerebrospinal fluid barrier of the choroid plexus.

Of these, 39% received >8 nT (23% receiving 5\u20137 nT), 70.2% were >70 years, and 93.4% survived. In total, 12% of patients admitted after 5 May 2024 were not vaccinated, while 59% received \u22654 vaccines (43% within the last 12 months). In total, 49% of admitted patients presented no previous infection (while 3% presented infection during the last year). Delta or Omicron variants would have accounted for \u226580% of admissions > 60 years compared to the first pandemic wave if no vaccines existed.

Neuropsychological deficits, including cognitive impairments and fatigue, are prevalent in individuals with PCC. The PoCoRe study aimed to evaluate the burden of neuropsychological deficits in PCC patients undergoing multidisciplinary indoor rehabilitation and to describe possible changes in this symptomatology. Methods The PoCoRe study, a prospective, non-randomized, controlled longitudinal study, recruited PCC patients from six German indoor rehabilitation centers. Eligible participants underwent comprehensive neuropsychological assessments at admission and discharge. Various measures were employed, including the fatigue scale for motor functioning and cognition (FSMC), the Test Battery for Attention (TAP) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Results Out of the 1,086 recruited participants, a total of N =\u202f701 participants were included in the main data analysis. The prevalence of fatigue on admission was high (84.6%) and decreased significantly by discharge (77.4%), with a mild effect size. Reaction times on the alertness subtest were abnormal in 70% of patients on admission and 50% on discharge. Sustained attention was abnormal in 55% of patients on admission, decreasing to 43% on discharge. These differences were significant with mild effect sizes. Furthermore, of the 27% of participants with pathological MoCA scores at admission, 63% improved to normative levels during rehabilitation, indicating a significant treatment effect (p \u2264\u202f0.001). However, the MoCA demonstrated limited sensitivity in detecting attention deficits. Conclusion The PoCoRe study highlights the high prevalence of neuropsychological deficits and fatigue in PCC patients, with notable improvements observed following multidisciplinary rehabilitation. Challenges remain in accurately identifying and addressing these deficits, underscoring the importance of comprehensive neuropsychological assessment and tailored rehabilitation interventions.

The main clinical treatment method for depression in Parkinson\u2019s disease is medication treatment. However, the medication treatment has a long cycle and many adverse reactions. Acupuncture as a non-pharmacological intervention method, has been widely used in the treatment of patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease and depressive disorders in China. Therefore, the study of acupuncture in the treatment of early Parkinson\u2019s disease with mild to moderate depression has important practical significance. Methods and analysis In this randomized, single-blinded, and placebo-controlled study, a total of 88 patients with depression in Parkinson\u2019s disease (DPD) will be randomly allocated to either an acupuncture group or a control group in parallel in a 1:1 allocation ratio. Each group will receive 30\u2009min acupuncture treatments or sham acupuncture treatments, 3 times a week, for 12\u2009weeks, followed by a 36-week follow-up period.

Part of the reason that treatments may only work in a subset of individuals is because of the high heterogeneity present in the EDs, even within diagnoses. Manualized treatments delivered in a standard format may not always address the most relevant symptoms for a specific individual.\n\n\nMETHOD\nThe current open series trial recruited participants with transdiagnostic ED diagnoses (N = 79) to investigate the feasibility, acceptability, and initial clinical efficacy of a 10-session network-informed personalized treatment for eating disorders. This treatment uses idiographic (i.e., one-person) network models of ecological momentary assessment symptom data to match participants to evidence-based modules of treatment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe found that network-informed personalized treatment was highly feasible with low dropout rates, was rated as highly acceptable, and had strong initial clinical efficacy.

They occur along a spectrum of disordered eating and compensatory weight management behaviors, and from low to high body weight. Psychiatric comorbidities are the norm. In contrast to other major psychiatric disorders, first-line treatments for FEDs are mainly psychological and/or nutrition-focused, with medications playing a minor adjunctive role. Patients, carers and clinicians all have identified personalization of treatment as a priority. Yet, for all FEDs, the evidence base supporting this personalization is limited. Importantly, disordered eating and related behaviors can have serious physical consequences and may put the patient's life at risk. In these cases, immediate safety and risk management considerations may at least for a period need to be prioritized over other efforts at personalization of care. This paper systematically reviews several key domains that may be relevant to the characterization of the individual patient with a FED aimed at personalization of management. These domains include symptom profile, clinical subtypes, severity, clinical staging, physical complications and consequences, antecedent and concomitant psychiatric conditions, social functioning and quality of life, neurocognition, social cognition and emotion, dysfunctional cognitive schemata, personality traits, family history, early environmental exposures, recent environmental exposures, stigma, and protective factors. Where possible, validated assessment measures for use in clinical practice are identified. The limitations of the current evidence are pointed out, and possible directions for future research are highlighted.

Experience of chronic stress is a risk factor for poor mental and physical well-being, and burnout. There is limited knowledge regarding optimal interventions to address stress and burnout among teachers. Objective: To undertake a scoping review of the literature in the last five years to determine various psychological interventions to address stress and burnout among teachers. Method: The PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews was followed. Relevant search terms were used to determine different interventions adopted to reduce teachers\u2019 stress and burnout. Articles published between 2018 and 2022 were identified using five bibliographic databases. Relevant articles were extracted, reviewed, collated, and thematically analyzed, and findings s were summarized. Results: Forty studies conducted in Asia, North America, Oceania, Europe, and Africa, met the inclusion criteria. Sixteen kinds of burnout and stress-reduction interventions were identified. The most popularly studied intervention were Mindfulness-Based Interventions alone or in combination with yoga or Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), followed by Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy (REBT). Mindfulness-Based Interventions led to decreased overall Teacher Stress Inventory (TSI) and emotional exhaustion subscale scores. REBT, primarily used with special education teachers, especially in Africa, has also shown positive results. Other interventions reporting positive outcomes include Inquiry-Based Stress Reduction (IBSR), the Stress Management and Resiliency Training Program (SMART), Cyclic Meditation, Group Sandplay, Progressive Muscle Relaxation, Autogenic Training, Sport-Based Physical Activity, Emotional Intelligence Ability Models and Christian Prayer and Prayer-Reflection.

Despite the availability of various psychosocial interventions, comprehensive evidence of their effectiveness and implementation is limited for this occupational group, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This mixed methods study aims to conduct a scoping review of characteristics, effectiveness, and implementation outcomes of psychosocial interventions for teachers\u2019 mental health and mental problems, integrating these with teachers\u2019 lived experiences to inform the implementation of mental health interventions in LMICs. Methods The study combines a scoping review with insights from an advisory group of teaching professionals with relevant lived experiences (PWLEs). The review will focus on examining psychosocial interventions studies promoting mental health or addressing mental problems among grade 1\u201312 school teachers of all genders, ages and contexts, except those working in specialized settings, such as special education centers, or disaster- or crisis-stricken zones. Intervention studies exclusively focusing on physical health or job-related outcomes will be excluded. Using pre-defined search terms, quantitative and qualitative research studies, including unpublished literature, will be searched across multiple databases. Titles and abstracts of identified studies will be screened against inclusion criteria, and the potentially relevant sources will be retrieved in full. Data will be extracted using a data extraction sheet developed for the study covering variables related to participant characteristics, intervention characteristics, study context, effectiveness and implementation outcomes. A purposively selected sample of 10 PWLEs will form the study advisory group and participate in four online workshop-group discussions. The meetings will include a presentation of the scoping review findings, followed by discussions on the relevance of these intervention packages for LMICs, adaptations needed to make them acceptable among school teachers and feasible for delivery in low-resourced settings like India. The synthesis of the data will employ narrative and thematic approaches to generate actionable insights for implementing psychosocial interventions in LMICs. Discussion This study will provide comprehensive evidence on the characteristics and outcomes of psychosocial interventions for teachers\u2019 mental health and mental problems. By integrating insights from teachers with relevant lived experiences, the study will provide practical guidelines for adapting and implementing psychosocial interventions among school teachers in LMICs.

However, such interventions have been designed to intervene at the individual-level and have been inadequate in sustainably alleviating burnout. In addition, these interventions have not considered how we might integrate more effective organizational-level strategies or reflect FLWs' own experiences and the unique contexts of frontline work in their design. One important, yet understudied, domain of frontline work that experiences high rates of burnout is gender-based violence (GBV) service provision in nonprofit organizations. Using a community-based participatory research approach, we ran 8 co-design workshops with FLWs and supervisors from various nonprofit GBV organizations in a large metropolitan city in the United States to understand their experiences, hopes, and perceptions of technology for burnout support within their organizations. We found that participants greatly valued their support systems and supervisory relationships at work. And while there was a desire to use technology as support tools for burnout, participants were wary of how it could conflict with these support systems and important organizational values.

Despite broad consensus that earlier intervention leads to better outcomes, evidence for this has been limited to correlational studies. This study examined timing effects of the Early Social Interaction (ESI) model, a parent-implemented intervention, using a complete crossover randomized controlled trial (RCT). Effects of Individual-ESI were compared when initiated at 18 or 27\u2009months of age, and also contrasted with effects of the less intensive Group-ESI as an active control condition. Participants included 82 autistic toddlers who received 9\u2009months of Individual-ESI and 9\u2009months of Group-ESI, with the timing/order randomized. Blinded clinicians completed assessments at baseline (18\u2009months of age), end of Condition 1 (27\u2009months), and end of Condition 2 (36\u2009months). Toddlers randomized to Individual-ESI at 18\u2009months showed greater gains during treatment than those starting Individual-ESI at 27\u2009months in receptive/expressive language, social communication, and daily living skills. This pattern was not observed for Group-ESI, demonstrating that timing effects were specific to Individual-ESI and ruling out maturation effects. This RCT demonstrated that earlier intensive, individualized intervention led to greater improvements, and suggests that even a narrow window of 18 versus 27\u2009months may impact child outcomes. Lay abstract Behavioral interventions that incorporate naturalistic, developmental strategies have been shown to improve outcomes for young children who receive an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis. Although there is broad consensus that children on the spectrum should begin supports as soon as possible, the empirical evidence for this is relatively limited and little is known about the optimal age to start autism-specific interventions. Our team conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the effects of starting intervention at different ages, using the Early Social Interaction (ESI) model, a parent-implemented intervention for toddlers on the spectrum. Participants included 82 autistic toddlers and their caregiver(s) who received 9 months of Individual-ESI and 9 months of Group-ESI, with the timing/order of these two treatment conditions randomized. Thus, families received the more intensive and individualized Individual-ESI at either 18 or 27\u2009months of age. Results revealed that children who received Individual-ESI earlier showed greater treatment gains than those who received this intervention later. Gains were demonstrated in several areas, which included the use and understanding of language, social use of communication skills, and self-help skills. Importantly, these findings were specific to the intensive and individualized parent coaching model compared to group-based treatment, allowing us to rule out the possibility that these timing effects were due to children getting older rather than the treatment itself.

The importance of early intervention has been widely demonstrated, and developmental trajectories in ASD emphasize the importance of nonverbal communication, such as intransitive gesture production, as a possible positive prognostic factor for language development. The use of technological tools in the therapy of individuals with ASD has also become increasingly important due to their higher engagement and responsiveness to technological objects, such as robots. Materials and methods We developed a training protocol using the humanoid robot NAO, called IOGIOCO (Interactive mirroring Games wIth sOCial rObot), based on the use of intransitive gestures embedded in naturalistic dialogues, stimulating a triadic interaction between child, robot and therapist. The training was divided into six levels; the first 2 levels were called \u201cfamiliarization levels,\u201d and the other 4 were \u201ctraining levels\u201d. The technological setup includes different complexity levels, from mirroring tasks to building spontaneous interactions. We tested the protocol on 10 preschool children with ASD (aged 2\u20136 years) for 14 weeks. We assessed them at recruitment (T0), at the end of training (T1), and after 6 months (T2).

Participants 20 participants with anhedonic depression who had received up to 20 sessions of ADepT, sampled from a pilot randomised controlled trial of ADepT versus Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). Setting A primary care psychological therapy clinic in Devon, UK, with interviews occurring between May 2018 and February 2020. Results Participants found the wellbeing focus of ADepT acceptable. Helpful aspects of therapy were a positive therapeutic bond, the structure and flow of therapy scaffolding the learning journey, the tools and techniques of therapy helping building wellbeing and booster sessions supporting long-term recovery. Negative aspects for some participants were therapy feeling too intense and triggering feelings of failure. Participants reported significant positive impacts of treatment on wellbeing, functioning and hope.

In addition to comparing the outcomes of a service failure involving a human agent versus a chatbot (Study 1), the research framework integrates the potential influences of anthropomorphic visual cues and intentionality (Studies 2 and 3). Through three experimental designs, the study reveals that when interacting with chatbots, customers blame the company more for the negative outcome, experiencing mainly frustration, compared with when they interact with a human agent. As the chatbot is perceived as not having intentions and control over them, it is not considered responsible. Thus, the company bears more responsibility for the poor service performance. However, the authors suggest that anthropomorphic visual cues might help mitigate the negative attributions to the company.

Varying the intensity of the pain penalties and pleasure rewards, we found that Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Command R+, GPT-4o, and GPT-4o mini each demonstrated at least one trade-off in which the majority of responses switched from points-maximisation to pain-minimisation or pleasure-maximisation after a critical threshold of stipulated pain or pleasure intensity is reached.

In this meta-analysis, we review the vast literature on serial dependence and quantitatively assess its key diagnostic characteristics across several different domains of visual perception. The meta-analyses fully characterize serial dependence in orientation, face, and numerosity perception. They show that serial dependence is defined by four main kinds of tuning: serial dependence decays with time (temporal-tuning), it depends on relative spatial location (spatial-tuning), it occurs only between similar features and objects (feature-tuning), and it is modulated by attention (attentional-tuning). We also review studies of serial dependence that report single observer data, highlighting the importance of individual differences in serial dependence. Finally, we discuss a range of outstanding questions and novel research avenues that are prompted by the meta-analyses.

A recent model of attractive serial dependence proposes a two-stage process in which adaptation causes a repulsive bias during encoding that is later counteracted by an attractive bias at the decision-making stage in a Bayesian-inference-like manner. Neural evidence exists for a repulsive bias at encoding, but evidence for the attractive bias during the response period has been more elusive. We recently [1] showed that while different stimuli in trial history exerted different (attractive or repulsive) serial biases on behavioral reports, during encoding the neural representation of the current item was always repulsively biased. Here we assessed whether this discrepancy between neural and behavioral effects is resolved during subsequent decision-making. Multivariate decoding of magnetoencephalography data during working memory recall showed a neural distinction between attractive and repulsive biases: an attractive neural bias emerged only late in recall. But stimuli that created a repulsive bias on behavior led to a repulsive neural bias early in the recall phase, suggesting that it had already been incorporated earlier.

Here we measured color discrimination for targets flanked by stimuli of variable color. The results verified both predictions, showing that although crowding can affect object recognition, it may be better understood not as a processing bottleneck, but rather as a consequence of mechanisms evolved to efficiently exploit the spatial redundancies of the natural world.

Method: The cross-cultural adaptation process balances literal translation components from one language to the other and an adaptation process that takes into account the culture of the target population. The cross-cultural adaptation process occurred in four major steps: i) translation process; ii) back translation process; iii) evaluation of the semantic equivalence of the preliminary Portuguese version; and iv) pre-test. Result: The analysis of the results from the target population's evaluation was predominantly qualitative, supplemented with indicators such as the Content Validity Index (CVI) to identify potential items requiring adjustments. The results may suggest the effectiveness of the iterative refinement process, potentially increasing confidence in the accuracy and relevance of the translated PBAT for the Portuguese-speaking population.

One of the affected groups was students. This systematic review summarizes the current literature on the prevalence, outcomes, and interventions for stress and anxiety among university, college, graduate, or postsecondary populations. Methods A systematic literature search was performed on PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, PsychInfo, and ProQuest, following PRISMA guidelines. Specific inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, and screening was performed to identify the definitive studies. Results The prevalence of anxiety was relatively high, ranging from 88.9 to 13.63%, and the prevalence of stress ranged from 56 to 28.14%. The predictors of stress and anxiety included young age, gender being female, STEM course, loneliness, low academic level in school, urban lockdown, confinement, having a preexisting disease, having relatives or friends infected with COVID-19, and proximity to a COVID-19 zone. The predictors of stress included gender being female, living with family, living in a household with many people, being confined rather than having the freedom to relocate, proximity to confirmed cases of COVID-19, lack of access to materials on COVID-19, preexisting mental disorders, and lack of knowledge on the preventable nature of COVID-19. The sources of anxiety among the university students identified in the study included academics, postponement of graduation, cancelation or disruption of planned events, inability to achieve goals, and finances. In addition, the students used trauma-focused, forward-focused, task-oriented, emotion-oriented, and avoidance-oriented coping strategies.

Structural analyses revealed that the ADHD-C type had significantly smaller volumes of the left inferior temporal gyrus and right lateral orbitofrontal cortex than the non-ADHD group, and the right lateral orbitofrontal cortex volume was positively correlated with language performance in the ADHD-C type. However, the volumes of the ADHD-A and ADHD-B types were not significantly different from those of the non-ADHD group.

However, as of yet, it remains unclear whether this pattern is of genetic predisposition or related to the illness itself. Methods A systematical meta\u2010analysis was performed to identify resting\u2010state functional differences in probands and their high\u2010risk first\u2010degree relatives of schizophrenia (FDRs\u2010SCZ) using Seed\u2010based d Mapping software. Subsequently, spatial associations between postmortem gene expression and neurotransmitters distribution data and neural activity alterations were conducted to uncover neural mechanisms underlaying FDRs\u2010SCZ and SCZ from a multidimensional perspective. Results A total of 13 studies comprising 503 FDRs\u2010SCZ and 605 healthy controls (HCs) and 129 studies comprising 6506 patients with SCZ and 6982 HCs were included. Compared to HCs, FDRs\u2010SCZ displayed increased spontaneous functional activity in the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex/medial prefrontal cortex (ACC/mPFC); patients with SCZ showed decreased spontaneous functional activity in the bilateral ACC/mPFC, bilateral postcentral gyrus, and right middle temporal gyrus as well as increased spontaneous functional activity in the bilateral striatum. The altered functional activity in FDRs\u2010SCZ and SCZ shared similar spatial associations with genes enriched in potassium ion transmembrane transport, channel activity, and complex. The FDRs\u2010SCZ and SCZ\u2010related brain functional patterns were additionally associated with dopaminergic, serotonergic, and cholinergic neurotransmitter distribution. Conclusions SCZ\u2010related resting\u2010state functional, neuroimaging transcriptomes, and neurotransmitters abnormalities may exist in high\u2010risk unaffected FDRs\u2010SCZ, rather than just in overt SCZ.

We examine how attitudes toward people with depression or schizophrenia have evolved in Germany since 1990, and whether there are different developments for both disorders. Methods Using data from the three decades, four wave repeated cross-sectional representative population study in the \u201cold\u201d (western) states in Germany with surveys in 1990 (n = 2,044), 2001 (n = 4,005), 2011 (n = 1,984), and 2020 (n = 2,449), we calculate time-trends for social distance and emotional reactions toward someone with major depression or acute schizophrenia. Results Social distance worsened in six out of seven situations for schizophrenia, whereas improving in two out of seven situations for depression. Emotions related to fear and uneasiness increased for schizophrenia, whereas tending to decrease for depression. Pro-social reactions like the desire to help increased for depression, but decreased for schizophrenia. Initially observed differences, favoring depression over schizophrenia, widened over the 30-year study period. For schizophrenia, the biggest negative changes occurred between 1990 and 2001, whereas some improvements with regard to depression occurred more recently. Conclusion Contrary to expectations, stigma has become more severe regarding acute schizophrenia in Germany over the last 30 years, whereas only slightly improving for depression.

Results from a population-based survey in Germany", "abstract": "Background Despite numerous awareness campaigns and anti-stigma programs, people with mental illness, particularly schizophrenia, are still stigmatized. Although the society is both cause and solution, societal-level conditions, such as society\u2019s customs and policies that legitimize and perpetuate stigmatization is often neglected. We used a milieu approach to investigate how shared social, cultural and political orientations and expectations are associated with manifestations of the mental-illness related stigma. Methods We analyzed cross-sectional data from 3,042 adults aged \u226518 years from a national vignette-based representative survey on the stigma of mental illness in Germany from 2020. For milieu classification, we used an established population segmentation tool based on values and political preferences. Two stigma measures associated with the stereotype and status loss/discrimination components were assessed (i.e., the Social Distance Scale and a list of well-known stereotypes associated with depression or schizophrenia). Descriptive analyses and one-way ANOVAs with post-hoc pairwise contrasts between milieu groups were used to evaluate agreement on stereotypes and the desire for social distance towards people with depression or schizophrenia. Results Negative stereotypes about people with a depression (i.e., beliefs about being weak-willed) and schizophrenia (i.e., beliefs about dangerousness) tended to be more common in milieu groups leaning more toward the authoritarian pole. Milieu groups with a more liberal attitude on the socio-cultural dimension further expressed a lower desire for social distance towards people with depression (p<0.001). However, the extent of differentiation between the milieu groups was less pronounced regarding the desire for social distance towards people with schizophrenia than towards people with depression. Conclusion Our findings suggest that socio-cultural and socioeconomic dimensions of the society can be used for both describing heterogeneous societies and illuminating the underlying social structure of stigma.

It is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, significantly impacting healthcare systems with considerable socioeconomic consequences. The main risk factors include exposure to tobacco smoke, environmental pollutants, occupational dust, and genetic factors such as alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. COPD is often associated with extrapulmonary comorbidities, particularly psychiatric disorders like depression and anxiety, which worsen patients\u2019 quality of life and prognosis. The prevalence of these disorders in patients with COPD varies significantly but is always higher than in healthy controls. Psychiatric disorders can negatively influence COPD management and vice versa, creating a complex bidirectional interaction. Depression and anxiety are the most common psychiatric comorbidities in patients with COPD, influenced by factors such as social isolation, physical limitations, and fear of exacerbations. Diagnosis of these psychiatric disorders is complicated by the overlap of symptoms with those of COPD. However, some screening tools can facilitate early detection. The treatment of psychiatric disorders in patients with COPD in a rehabilitation setting requires a multidisciplinary approach involving pulmonologists, neurologists and psychologists. Pharmacological therapy with antidepressants shows mixed results in terms of efficacy and safety, with some studies reporting benefits on quality of life and others suggesting an increased risk of exacerbations and pneumonia.

However, it is unclear whether subjective and objective measures of childhood adversity (a) show agreement, and (b) differentially predict psychopathology. Method To address this, we conducted a pre\u2010registered meta\u2010analysis to examine the agreement between subjective and objective measures of childhood adversity, and their prediction of psychopathology. We searched in PubMed, PsycINFO and Embase for articles with both subjective measures (self\u2010reports) and objective measures of childhood adversity (comprising official records, or reports from multiple informants unrelated to the target individual), and measures of psychopathology. Results We identified 22 studies (n\u2009=\u200918,163) with data on agreement between subjective and objective measures of childhood adversities, and 17 studies (n\u2009=\u200914,789) with data on the associations between subjective and objective measures with psychopathology.

Ruminative thinking, i.e., the tendency to dwell on particular issues or ideas, may affect the perceived aversiveness and ability to cope with adverse life events. However, the role that rumination plays in the relationship between adverse life events and the presence of PLEs remains unclear. The purpose of this study is to assess the association between adverse life events and PLEs in a longitudinal sample of young adults and adolescents, and to investigate whether this relationship is mediated by ruminative thinking. Methods We used a longitudinal naturalistic sample of 706 volunteers assessed at ages 18 and 22 years, within the Imagen consortium. Lifetime occurrence of adverse life events (i.e., events perceived as strongly negative by participants) was investigated using the Life Events Questionnaire. The Community Assessment of Psychic Experience (CAPE-42) served to assess the presence of PLEs, while ruminative thinking was investigated through the Ruminative Response Scale. Results Results showed that both frequency of PLEs and their persistence over time were associated with greater adverse life events exposure (r = 0.32, p < 0.001 and F1 = 9.8; p < 0.001, respectively) and greater ruminative response (r = 0.66, p < 0.001 and F1 = 94.9; p < 0.001, respectively). Mediation analyses showed that relationship between adverse life events and PLEs frequency was partially mediated by rumination (direct effect Z: 5.4, p < 0.001; indirect effect Z: 6.9, p < 0.001; total effect Z: 5.9, p < 0.001). Considering changes between the two assessment timepoints, relationship between PLEs variation between 18 and 22 years and adverse life events occurred during the same period was partially mediated by changes in rumination (direct effect Z: 2.8, p < 0.005; indirect effect Z: 4.3, p < 0.001; total effect Z: 4.3; p < 0.001). Discussion Overall, our findings confirm that the presence of adverse life events may increase the risk of experiencing PLEs in healthy individuals and suggest that dysfunctional coping strategies, such as ruminative thinking, may be related to psychosis proneness.

To date, the majority of research investigating the effects of these changes has measured time spent on social media, yielding inconclusive results-likely because this approach conceptualizes social media as a monolith. Social media experiences are complex and diverse, as are adolescents themselves. Emerging research has identified several specific components of social media that have varied associations with adolescent mental health, as well as individual difference factors that may alter these associations across adolescents. In this annual research review, we synthesize evidence regarding heterogeneity in social media effects related to (a) specific components of social media and (b) adolescents' individual differences regarding social media use and effects. We first focus on the specific social media components-content, features, and functions-that may be especially relevant for adolescent development. These include functions designed to foster relationships and social connections (e.g., social media feeds, 'friends'), hateful content, notifications, risky content, and algorithmically curated content, among others. Next, we provide an overview of for whom these effects may matter most.

While policies around knowledge are essential for targeting misinformation, they are value-laden; in choosing how to present information, we undermine non-traditional, often non-Western, ways of knowing. Epistemic injustice is the systemic exclusion of certain people and methods from the knowledge canon. Epistemic injustice chips away at one's testimony and vocabulary until they are stripped of their due right to know and understand. In this paper, we articulate how epistemic injustice in sociotechnical applications leads to material harm. Inspired by a hybrid collaborative autoethnography of 14 CSCW practitioners, we present three cases of epistemic injustice in sociotechnical applications: online transgender healthcare, identity sensemaking on r/bisexual, and Indigenous ways of knowing on r/AskHistorians. We further explore signature tensions across our autoethnographic materials and relate them to previous CSCW research areas and personal non-technological experiences. We argue that epistemic injustice can serve as a unifying and intersectional lens for CSCW research by surfacing dimensions of epistemic community and power. Finally, we present a call to action of three changes the CSCW community should make to move toward its own goals of research justice. We call for CSCW researchers to center individual experiences, bolster communities, and remediate issues of epistemic power as a means towards epistemic justice.

Data from the nationally representative 2011\u20132021 Youth Risk Behavior Surveys were used to estimate the 2021 prevalence of IVV reported by U.S. high school students. IVV included past-year sexual TDV, physical TDV, sexual violence by anyone, electronic bullying, being bullied on school property, and lifetime forced sex and was analyzed by demographic characteristics and sex of sexual contacts. This report also explored trends in IVV over this 10-year period among U.S. high school students. In 2021, a total of 8.5% of students reported physical TDV, 9.7% reported sexual TDV, 11.0% reported sexual violence by anyone (with 59.5% of those also reporting sexual TDV), 15.0% reported bullying on school property, and 15.9% reported electronic bullying victimization during the past 12 months; 8.5% also reported experiencing forced sex in their lifetime. Disparities were observed for each form of IVV assessed for females and for most forms of IVV among racial and ethnic minority students; students who identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual, questioning, or other (LGBQ+); and students who reported their sexual contacts as same sex only or both sexes. Trend analyses indicated that physical TDV, sexual TDV, any physical or sexual TDV, and both physical and sexual TDV victimization decreased from 2013 to 2021 (although sexual TDV increased from 2019 to 2021).

However, there is limited research that has considered the cultural and structural mechanisms that may impact ARA experiences among Latine youth. Further, although parents play a crucial role in ARA prevention, few studies have investigated how adolescent-parent differences in acculturation and discrimination are associated with ARA. The objective of this exploratory study of Latine families was to examine how acculturation, discrimination, and adolescent-parent acculturation/discrimination differences relate to ARA victimization and perpetration. Parent-adolescent dyads recruited from clinic and community-based settings in Pittsburgh and Kansas City completed matched surveys. Parent-adolescent acculturation and discrimination differences were calculated using multilevel linear models. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine associations among ARA victimization and perpetration and adolescent-reported acculturation, adolescent-reported discrimination, and adolescent-parent acculturation and discrimination differences. One hundred eighty-two adolescents and their parent/caregiver (n\u2009=\u2009364) completed a matched survey in English or Spanish from March 2020 to March 2021. Forty-three percent of adolescents reported that they had started dating; of these 35% and 24% reported ARA victimization and perpetration, respectively. Higher levels of adolescent-reported acculturation conflict were associated with lower ARA victimization (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 0.24; 95% confidence interval, CI [0.08, 0.75]); conversely, higher adolescent-reported discrimination was associated with ARA victimization (aOR: 2.50 [1.30, 4.60]) and perpetration (aOR: 2.10 [1.10, 3.90]). Wider adolescent-parent acculturation differences in Spanish language (aOR: 3.40 [1.04, 11.30]) and interpersonal discrimination (aOR: 2.40 [1.10, 5.20]) were associated with increased ARA victimization.

These cognitive impairments can have profound negative effects on communication functions, resulting in a cognitive-communication disorder. Cognitive-communication disorders can significantly limit a person's ability to socialize, work, and study, and thus are critical targets for intervention. This article presents the updated INCOG 2.0 recommendations for management of cognitive-communication disorders. As social cognition is central to cognitive-communication disorders, this update includes interventions for social cognition. Methods: An expert panel of clinicians/researchers reviewed evidence published since 2014 and developed updated recommendations for interventions for cognitive-communication and social cognition disorders, a decision-making algorithm tool, and an audit tool for review of clinical practice. Results: Since INCOG 2014, there has been significant growth in cognitive-communication interventions and emergence of social cognition rehabilitation research. INCOG 2.0 has 9 recommendations, including 5 updated INCOG 2014 recommendations, and 4 new recommendations addressing cultural competence training, group interventions, telerehabilitation, and management of social cognition disorders. Cognitive-communication disorders should be individualized, goal- and outcome-oriented, and appropriate to the context in which the person lives and incorporate social communication and communication partner training. Group therapy and telerehabilitation are recommended to improve social communication. Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) should be offered to the person with severe communication disability and their communication partners should also be trained to interact using AAC. Social cognition should be assessed and treated, with a focus on personally relevant contexts and outcomes.

Integrated Nursing Interventions play a critical role in the care of TBI patients, but limited research has evaluated their efficacy in this setting. This study aims to assess the impact of Integrated Nursing Interventions on patient outcomes and complications in the ED. Methods This retrospective study included 246 patients with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) treated in the emergency department from January 2022 to December 2022. Of these, 138 patients received Integrated Nursing Interventions, while 108 did not. Baseline characteristics, clinical outcomes, and complications were compared between the two groups. Descriptive statistics, logistic regression, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were used to evaluate the effect of nursing interventions on outcomes such as mortality, complications, and hospital stay. Results Among the 246 mTBI patients, those receiving Integrated Nursing Interventions (n=138, 56.1%) experienced significantly lower rates of adverse events, including perioperative intracranial hemorrhage (4.3% vs 12.0%, P=0.025) and shorter hospital stays (6\u00b12 days vs 11\u00b13 days, P<0.001). The study sample included 56.5% female, with 80.1% age \u2264 80. Integrated Nursing Interventions refer to coordinated care strategies that combine multiple nursing approaches tailored to address both physical and psychological needs of patients. For instance, the use of patient education combined with individualized pain management strategies. Logistic regression analysis revealed that Integrated Nursing Interventions were associated with a significant reduction in in-hospital mortality (OR=1.828, 95% CI: 1.619\u20132.318, P<0.001). ROC curve analysis demonstrated strong predictive accuracy for outcomes such as readmission rate (AUC=0.757), 30-day mortality (AUC=0.836), and 90-day mortality (AUC=0.760). Conclusion Integrated Nursing Interventions in the emergency department significantly improve patient outcomes for mTBI patients, reducing mortality, complications, and length of hospital stay. These interventions, which include early assessment, timely intervention, patient education, and collaborative care, are essential for optimizing TBI management. The high predictive value of these interventions further underscores their importance in emergency care.

However, one related problem that merits research is SFV addiction, especially among adolescents due to their immature self-control abilities. Although recent research has discussed the formation process of SFV addiction from psychological needs and the SFV features perspective, scarce attention has been paid to investigating the relationship between stress and SFV addiction, as well as the relationship between SFV addiction and its consequences. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine whether school burnout (school stress), social phobia (social stress), and parental phubbing (family stress) trigger SFV addiction based on stress-coping theory and, furthermore, whether SFV addiction leads to low levels of happiness (psychological consequence), parent\u2013child relationship quality (relational consequence), and perseverance (behavioral consequence) among adolescents. The proposed model was tested based on data collected from 242 adolescents from across China under the age of 18 with the experience watching SFVs. A covariance-based structural equation modeling (CB-SEM) method was used for data analysis. The results showed that school burnout and social phobia significantly triggered SFV addiction, which later negatively and significantly influenced adolescents\u2019 happiness, parent\u2013child relationship quality, and perseverance. The study also found that SFV addiction served as a mediator between the drivers and consequences of SFV addiction. This study provides several theoretical implications. First, this study is one of the first to explain adolescents\u2019 SFV addiction from stress-coping perspective, thereby enriching research in the field of SFV addiction. Second, prior research has rarely discussed the impacts of stresses from various environments on addiction behavior in a single study.

Researchers have found that proactive personality is negatively associated with behavioral addiction. Additionally, SFV Apps tend to place users in a \u201cfilter bubble\u201d to passively consume the pushed video content. Proactiveness could be an effective trait to resist the excessive use of SFVs. Thus, proactive personality may be a negative predictor of SFV addiction.

Methods Convenience sampling was adopted to conduct an online questionnaire survey among college students from 8 universities in 5 provinces of China. Proactive personality scale (PPS), brief resilience scale (BRS), Brief self-control scale (BSCS), and SFV addiction scale were applied in designing the questionnaire. A total of 560 valid questionnaires were obtained with ages ranging from 17 to 22 (19.32\u00b11.14), among whom 40.18% were males and 59.28% females. Results SFV addiction among college students was negatively correlated with proactive personality, resilience, and self-control. Proactive personality has significant direct effect on SFV addiction, and the other two variables play partial mediating roles including chain mediation between proactive personality and SFV addiction. The ratio of SFV addicts amounted to 23.57%, which was slightly higher compared to previous research findings.

This study explored the prevalence of short-form video addiction (SVA) among Jordanian youth, its correlates, and its impact on attention and memory function, with an emphasis on understanding the mediating and moderating role of attention in the relationship between SVA and memory. Methods: Utilizing a cross-sectional survey design, data were collected from 1029 university students across 25 higher-education institutions in Jordan. Results: Half of the participants exhibited moderate to high levels of SVA. The findings indicated a significant increase in SVA scores among female students (p = 0.003), those of a younger age (p = 0.045), those with lower GPAs (p = 0.013), and those who dedicated fewer hours to study (p = 0.006). Notably, there was a significant and large correlation between SVA scores and students\u2019 perceptions of user-generated content (p < 0.001). Attention partially mediated the relationship between SVA and memory function with excellent model fit indices (\u03c72(12) = 14.11, p = 0.05, RMSEA = 0.03, GFI = 0.99, IFI = 0.99, TLI = 0.98, CFI = 0.99). However, attention did not moderate this relationship, suggesting that the impact of SVA on memory is consistent across varying levels of attention. Discussion: The findings underscore the significant engagement of Jordanian youth with short-form video content and the potential cognitive risks associated with SVA. Interventions to manage attention could mitigate the adverse effects of SVA on cognitive functions. This study calls for a comprehensive approach to address SVA among youth, including the development of digital literacy programs, mental health support services, and policy interventions that promote a balanced digital ecosystem and responsible media consumption.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2025-01-26", "synthetic_support_claim": "Attention partially mediates the relationship between short-form video addiction and memory function among Jordanian youth.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Short-form video addiction results in long-term cognitive decline that affects academic performance and mental health stability."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "96cd121190e09b5c4ff209fe4388c366a762a88d", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/96cd121190e09b5c4ff209fe4388c366a762a88d", "title": "A practical introduction to using the drift diffusion model of decision-making in cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and health sciences", "abstract": "Recent years have seen a rapid increase in the number of studies using evidence-accumulation models (such as the drift diffusion model, DDM) in the fields of psychology and neuroscience.

Previous studies have not been successful in linking differences in self\u2010reported irritability to traditional AP metrics (i.e., reaction time and accuracy).

Multiple linear regressions were used to evaluate whether DDM parameters better predict state frustration and trait irritability over traditional AP metrics. Higher state frustration was predicted by lower decision threshold during the frustration block and larger decrease in this parameter between nonfrustration and frustration blocks, over traditional AP metrics.

Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) were employed to forecast the disease burden from 2022 to 2030. Results The projected global burden of Alzheimer\u2019s disease from 2022 to 2030 indicates a decrease in DALYs, with an Estimated Annual Percentage Change (EAPC) of \u22121.44 (95% CI: \u22121.45, \u22121.42). Similarly, death rates and incidence rates also show a decline, with EAPCs of \u22121.80 (95% CI: \u22121.83, \u22121.77) and \u22121.27 (95% CI: \u22121.29, \u22121.26) respectively.

Although artificial intelligence is increasingly used, there is a lack of empirical studies that aim to understand consumers\u2019 experience with chatbots. Moreover, in a context characterized by constant population aging and an increased life-expectancy, the way aging adults perceive technology becomes of great interest. However, based on the digital divide (unequal access to technology, knowledge, and resources), and since young adults (aged between 18 and 34 years old) are considered to have greater affinity for technology, most of the research is dedicated to their perception. The present paper investigates the way chatbots are perceived by middle-aged and aging adults in Romania. Methods An online opinion survey has been conducted. The age-range of the subjects is 40\u201378 years old, a convenience sampling technique being used (N = 235). The timeframe of the study is May\u2013June 2021. Thus, the COVID-19 pandemic is the core context of the research. A covariance-based structural equation modelling (CB-SEM) has been used to test the theoretical assumptions as it is a procedure used for complex conceptual models and theory testing. Results The results show that while perceived ease of use is explained by the effort, the competence, and the perceive external control in interacting with chatbots, perceived usefulness is supported by the perceived ease of use and subjective norms. Furthermore, individuals are likely to further use chatbots (behavioral intention) if they consider this interaction useful and if the others\u2019 opinion is in favor of using it. Gender and age seem to have no effect on behavioral intention.

Many psychiatrists struggle to identify the presence of mental illness or negative emotion early to provide a better course of treatment before they reach a critical stage. One of the most challenging problems is detecting depression in people at the earliest possible stage. Researchers are using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze text content uploaded on social media, which helps to design approaches for detecting depression. This work analyses numerous prior studies that used learning techniques to identify depression. The existing methods suffer from better model representation problems to detect depression from the text with high accuracy. The present work addresses a solution to these problems by creating a new hybrid deep learning neural network design with better text representations called \u201cFasttext Convolution Neural Network with Long Short-Term Memory (FCL).\u201d In addition, this work utilizes the advantage of NLP to simplify the text analysis during the model development. The FCL model comprises fasttext embedding for better text representation considering out-of-vocabulary (OOV) with semantic information, a convolution neural network (CNN) architecture to extract global information, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to extract local features with dependencies. The present work was implemented on real-world datasets utilized in the literature.

Moreover, that is why research is focused on this subject. Individuals experiencing depression often suffer from anxiety and insecurity in their daily lives, which can impact their relationships and work. In severe cases, this may also lead to various health issues and, tragically, even suicide. We are in the digital age. With the surge in the growth of social media usage, people utilize it as a platform to voice out their emotions, feelings and thoughts. Having machine learning improve and sample data being available regarding depression, there is potential for producing an early depression diagnosis system that would be crucial to reduce the victims number. A machine learning-based model to predict depression is showcased by this paper, based on extracting text data from one of the most common social media outlets: Twitter. We'll use NLP technique through user posts and classify them as indicative or not of depression. We use a bidirectional LSTM model trained on datasets from Twitter to detect depressive tendencies. Our model demonstrates excellent precision in distinguishing between a depressive text and a non depressive text achieving a precision rate of 98% and a recall rate of 99%. and really helps in opening horizons for artificial intelligence to more precisely identify mental health conditions based on an individual's online behavior.

Cognitive deficits in depression are associated with poor psychosocial functioning and worse response to conventional antidepressants. However, a consistent profile of neurocognitive abnormalities in depression remains unclear. Objective We used data-driven parsing of cognitive performance to reveal subgroups present across depressed individuals and then investigate the change pattern of cognitive subgroups across the course in follow-up. Method We assessed cognition in 163 patients with depression using The Chinese Brief Cognitive Test(C-BCT) and the scores were compared with those of 196 healthy controls (HCs). 58 patients were reassessed after 8 weeks. We used K-means cluster analysis to identify cognitive subgroups, and compared clinical variables among these subgroups. A linear mixed-effects model, incorporating time and group (with interaction term: time \u00d7 group) as fixed effects, was used to assess cognitive changes over time. Stepwise logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify risk factors associated with these subgroups. Results Two distinct neurocognitive subgroups were identified: (1) a cognitive-impaired subgroup with global impairment across all domains assessed by the C-BCT, and (2) a cognitive-preserved subgroup, exhibited intact cognitive function, with performance well within the healthy range. The cognitive-impaired subgroup presented with more severe baseline symptoms, including depressed mood, guilt, suicidality, and poorer work performance. Significant group \u00d7 time interactions were observed in the Trail Making Test Part A (TMT-A) and Continuous Performance Test (CPT), but not in Symbol Coding or Digit Span tests. Despite partial improvement in TMT-A and CPT tests, the cognitive-impaired subgroup's scores remained lower than those of the cognitive-preserved subgroup across all tests at the study endpoint. Multiple regression analysis indicated that longer illness duration, lower educational levels, and antipsychotic medication use may be risk factors for cognitive impairment. Conclusion This study identifies distinguishable cognitive subgroups in acute depression, thereby confirming the presence of cognitive heterogeneity. The cognitive-impaired subgroup exhibits distinct symptoms and persistent cognitive deficits even after treatment. Screening for cognitive dysfunction may facilitate more targeted interventions.

Despite this burgeoning evidence base and theory linking procrastination to higher levels of stress, as well as the reverse, the role of context in this potentially dynamic association has received relatively little attention. In this conceptual review I argue that from a mood regulation perspective of procrastination, stressful contexts necessarily increase risk for procrastination because they deplete coping resources and lower the threshold for tolerating negative emotions. Drawing on insights from coping and emotion regulation theory, the new stress context vulnerability model of procrastination proposes that the risk for procrastination increases in stressful contexts primarily because procrastination is a low-resource means of avoiding aversive and difficult task-related emotions. The new model is then applied to evidence on the primary and secondary sources of stress during the COVID-19 pandemic and how they may have increased vulnerability for procrastination. After discussing potential applications of the new model for understanding how and why risk for procrastination may increase in other stressful contexts, approaches that might mitigate vulnerability for procrastination in high-stress contexts are discussed.

The mean age of PLwD was 80.5 \u00b1 8.3 years (73.0% of women) and their Short IQCODE mean score was 4.1 \u00b1 1.0. Lower caregiving burden was significantly associated with higher perceived social support (\u03b2 = 0.33, p < 0.01), with higher positive caregiving experience (\u03b2 = 0.33, p < 0.01), and higher caregiving intensity (\u03b2 = 0.24, p < 0.05) among informal caregivers of PLwD. The associations between caregiver burden and applying two therapeutic communication methods were not significant.

Understanding these variables is essential for designing interventions to prevent negative outcomes in at-risk caregivers. The research explored how varying levels of caregiving burden and types of perceived social support influence psychological well-being. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 387 family caregivers of older adults in the Marche region (Italy) between November 2019 and March 2020. Data were collected via a structured questionnaire assessing psychological well-being (WHO-5 Well-Being Index), caregiving burden, and social support (COPE Index). Statistical analyses were performed using Jamovi software, with a significance threshold set at p\u2009<\u20090.05. Results A significant negative correlation was found between caregiving burden and psychological well-being [r (364)\u2009=\u2009\u2212 0.540, p\u2009<\u20090.001], with caregiving burden being a significant predictor of psychological well-being reduction (R2\u2009=\u20090.290; F\u2009=\u2009150, p\u2009<\u20090.001). A threshold value of 2 (on a 1\u20134 scale) was identified, where caregiving burden predicted a significant reduction in psychological well-being. Conversely, greater perceived social support was positively correlated with better psychological well-being [r (357)\u2009=\u20090.348, p\u2009<\u20090.001] and was a significant predictor of it [R2\u2009=\u20090.121; F\u2009=\u200949.2, p\u2009<\u20090.001]. Support from social and health services had the most notable impact on psychological well-being. Moreover, social support mitigated the negative impact of caregiving burden on psychological well-being.

In this article, we analyze two computational representations that aim to model the presence and changes of the emotions expressed by social media users. In our evaluation we use two recent public data sets for two important mental disorders: Depression and Anorexia.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel Unified Generative framework for Image Emotion Classification (UGRIE), which is capable of simultaneously modeling various emotion models and capturing intricate semantic relationships between emotion labels. Our approach employs a flexible natural language template, converting the IEC task into a template-filling process that can be easily adapted to accommodate a diverse range of IEC tasks.

Recently, multimodal emotion recognition has been enhanced with wireless body area network (WBAN) access to IoMT, where wireless medical sensors are interconnected and abundant signals are acquired conveniently. However, how to synthesize these multisource physiological signals to facilitate emotion recognition is a challenging problem due to their heterogeneity and interference.

Although touted for increasing hiring fit and reducing bias, it is unclear how job-seekers perceive emotion AI-enabled asynchronous interviews. This gap is striking, given job-seekers' marginalized position in hiring and how job-seekers with marginalized identities may be particularly vulnerable to this technology's potential harms. Addressing this gap, we conducted exploratory interviews with 14 U.S.-based participants with direct, recent experience with emotion AI-enabled asynchronous interviews. While participants acknowledged the asynchronous, virtual modality's potential benefits to employers and job-seekers, they perceived harms to job-seekers associated with automatic emotion inferences that our analysis maps to distributive, procedural, and interactional injustices. We find that social identity can inform job-seekers' perceptions of emotion AI, extending prior work's understandings of the factors contributing to job-seekers' perceptions of AI (broadly) in hiring. Moreover, our results suggest that emotion AI use may reconfigure demands for emotional labor in hiring and that deploying this technology in its current state may unjustly risk harmful outcomes for job-seekers - or, at the very least, perceptions thereof, which shape behaviors and attitudes. Accordingly, we recommend against the present adoption of emotion AI in hiring, identifying opportunities for the design of future asynchronous hiring interview platforms to be meaningfully transparent, contestable, and privacy-preserving.

Aripiprazole, a third-generation antipsychotic drug, is extensively metabolized by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 isoenzymes, while bupropion, used in depressive disorders, is known as a moderate or strong CYP2D6 enzyme inhibitor. This in vivo experiment aimed to assess the presence of a pharmacokinetic drug interaction between aripiprazole and bupropion and its magnitude on the systemic exposure of aripiprazole. Methods: 24 healthy Wistar albino male rats were included in two study groups. A single dose of 8 mg/kg aripiprazole was given to rats in the reference group, while the test group received repeated doses of bupropion for 6 days, followed by a single dose of aripiprazole. An LC-MS/MS method was developed for the concomitant quantification of aripiprazole and its active metabolite, dehydroaripiprazole, and non-compartmental analysis was employed to assess their pharmacokinetic parameters. Results: The mean AUC0-\u221e of aripiprazole increased 5.65-fold (1117.34 \u00b1 931.41 vs. 6311.66 \u00b1 2978.71 hr\u00b7ng/mL), the mean Cmax increased by 96.76% and the apparent systemic clearance decreased over 9-fold after bupropion repeated doses. The exposure to aripiprazole\u2019s active metabolite increased as well, having a 4-fold increase in the mean AUC0\u2013\u221e (from 461.13 \u00b1 339.82 to 1878.66 \u00b1 1446.91 hr\u00b7ng/mL) and a 2-fold increase in the mean Cmax.

However, recent systematic reviews have been primarily narrative. Additionally, the pooled effectiveness of AAIs was absent from these systematic reviews.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis, searching multiple databases, including Web of Science, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Scopus, PsycINFO, EMBASE and Cochrane, from inception of the databases to March 2024. We retrieved 17 randomised controlled trials or quasi-experimental studies and used Review Manager 5.4.1 software to perform a meta-analysis of the effects of AAIs in treating children with ADHD. We conducted a set of random-effects meta-analyses to estimate standardised mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using subgroup data by different outcome domains extracted from eight randomised controlled trials, in relation to changes in behavioural, mental and physical functioning in a total of 307 children with ADHD before and after the intervention.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn comparison with non-AAI groups, AAIs significantly improved attention problems in children with ADHD (SMD\u2009=\u2009-0.42, 95% CI\u2009=\u2009-0.71 to -0.13), self-esteem (0.46, 0.14 to 0.78), learning and cognition problems (-0.69, -0.98 to -0.39) and motor proficiency (0.77, 0.11 to 1.42). The pooled effect of AAIs on the severity of ADHD symptoms in the experimental group was not significantly different from the effect of conventional treatments in the control group (0.10, -0.31 to 0.52).

This increased coupling of employees and AI portends a shift toward more of an \"asocial system,\" wherein people may feel socially disconnected at work. Drawing upon the social affiliation model, we develop a model delineating both adaptive and maladaptive consequences of this situation. Specifically, we theorize that the more employees interact with AI in the pursuit of work goals, the more they experience a need for social affiliation (adaptive)-which may contribute to more helping behavior toward coworkers at work-as well as a feeling of loneliness (maladaptive), which then further impair employee well-being after work (i.e., more insomnia and alcohol consumption).

This study elucidates how the fit between multitasking and polychronicity among employees in organizations can synergistically influence their self-leadership within the context of AI empowerment. This study conducts two time-lagged survey studies using polynomial regression analysis, block variable analysis, and response surface methodology based on the \u201cFit Between Individuals, Tasks and Technology\u201d (FITT) framework and the JD-R theoretical model. Study 1 examined the polychronicity-multitasking fit based on data collected from 116 employees at two time points in an AI company in China. Study 2 tested the mediating and moderating effect based on data of 188 employees from two other AI companies in China at three time points. The results show that congruence between polychronicity and multitasking predicts greater employee self-leadership compared to incongruence, and the higher the degree of congruence, the stronger the self-leadership. For incongruence, the \u201chigh-low\u201d state promotes self-leadership better than the \u201clow-high\u201d state.

The purpose of this article is to study the functional connectivity of the brain by using the phase synchronization of electroencephalogram (EEG) channel information in different emotional states. Considering that the phase locking value (PLV) can effectively reflect the phase synchronization relationship between the EEG channels, it is adopted to describe the functional connection relationship of the brain.

Furthermore, the modular structure of the brain network is constructed through community detection to extract its more comprehensive local characteristics for connectivity analysis. The results show that compared with positive emotions, brain regions under negative emotions have higher phase synchronization, more complex brain connectivity patterns, and more obvious modular structures.

These feedback loops may drive oscillations in the alpha range, linked strongly with serial dependence.

By leveraging individual differences, we searched for links in the magnitude of serial dependence effects across the different tasks. On the group level, we observed significant attractive serial dependence effects for all tasks, except the pupil response. The rare absence of a serial dependence effect for the reflex-like pupil light response suggests that sequential effects require cortical processing or even higher-level cognition. For the tasks with significant serial dependence effects, there was substantial and reliable variance in the magnitude of the sequential effects. We observed a significant relationship in the strength of serial dependence for the two perceptual tasks, but no relation between the perceptual tasks and oculomotor tracking. This emphasizes differences in processing between perception and oculomotor control. The lack of a correlation across all tasks indicates that it is unlikely that the relation between the individual differences in the magnitude of serial dependence is driven by more general mechanisms related to for example working memory.

Control theory provides the rationale for evaluating brain state transitions from a controllability perspective, which may help reveal the brain mechanism for clinical features such as cognitive control deficits associated with schizophrenia. We hypothesized that brain controllability would be altered in patients with schizophrenia, and that controllability of brain networks would be related to clinical symptomatology. Study Design Controllability measurements of functional brain networks, including average controllability and modal controllability, were calculated and compared between 125 first-episode never-treated patients with schizophrenia and 133 healthy controls (HCs). Associations between controllability metrics and clinical symptoms were evaluated using sparse canonical correlation analysis. Study Results Compared to HCs, patients showed significantly increased average controllability (PFDR = .023) and decreased modal controllability (PFDR = .023) in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). General psychopathology symptoms and positive symptoms were positively correlated with average controllability in regions of default mode network and negatively associated with average controllability in regions of sensorimotor, dorsal attention, and frontoparietal networks. Conclusions Our findings suggest that altered controllability of functional activity in dACC may play a critical role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, consistent with the importance of this region in cognitive and brain state control operations.

Despite this importance, it remains unknown how imagination is realized in the brain. Substantial research focusing on the hippocampus, a brain structure traditionally linked to memory, indicates that firing patterns in spatially tuned neurons can represent previous and upcoming paths in space. This work has generally been interpreted under standard views that the hippocampus implements cognitive abilities primarily related to actual experience, whether in the past (e.g. recollection, consolidation), present (e.g. spatial mapping) or future (e.g. planning). However, relatively recent findings in rodents identify robust patterns of hippocampal firing corresponding to a variety of alternatives to actual experience, in many cases without overt reference to the past, present or future. Given these findings, and others on hippocampal contributions to human imagination, we suggest that a fundamental function of the hippocampus is to generate a wealth of hypothetical experiences and thoughts. Under this view, traditional accounts of hippocampal function in episodic memory and spatial navigation can be understood as particular applications of a more general system for imagination.

However, this assumption does not allow accounting for real problem solving by individuals who can exhibit irrational behaviors or hold inaccurate beliefs about their environment. In this work, we present a novel framework called Dynamic Structure Learning (DSL), which allows agents to adapt their learning rules and internal representations dynamically. This structural flexibility enables a deeper understanding of how individuals learn and adapt in real-world scenarios. The DSL framework reconstructs the most likely sequence of agent structures\u2014sourced from a pool of learning rules and environment models\u2014based on observed behaviors. The method provides insights into how an agent\u2019s internal structure model evolves as it transitions between different structures throughout the learning process. We applied our framework to study rat behavior in a maze task. Our results demonstrate that rats progressively refine their mental map of the maze, evolving from a suboptimal representation associated with repetitive errors to an optimal one that guides efficient navigation. Concurrently, their learning rules transition from heuristic-based to more rational approaches.

These facts are generally acknowledged nowadays, not only by scientists, but also by the majority of politicians and citizens. Nevertheless, this understanding has caused insufficient changes in our decision making and behavior to preserve our natural resources and to prevent upcoming (natural) disasters.

In natural and primordial situations, they may lead to quick, practical, and satisfying decisions, but these decisions may be poor and risky in a broad range of modern, complex, and long-term challenges, like climate change or pandemic prevention. We first briefly present the social-psychological characteristics that are inherent to (or typical for) most sustainability issues. These are: experiential vagueness, long-term effects, complexity and uncertainty, threat of the status quo, threat of social status, personal vs. community interest, and group pressure. For each of these characteristics, we describe how this relates to cognitive biases, from a neuro-evolutionary point of view, and how these evolved biases may affect sustainable choices or behaviors of people.

Nevertheless, the theoretical nature of attention control as a cognitive construct has been the subject of heated debate, spurred on by psychometric issues that have stymied efforts to reliably measure differences in the ability to control attention. For theory to advance, our measures must improve. We introduce three efficient, reliable, and valid tests of attention control that each take less than 3 min to administer: Stroop Squared, Flanker Squared, and Simon Squared. Two studies (online and in-lab) comprising more than 600 participants demonstrate that the three \"Squared\" tasks have great internal consistency (avg. = .95) and test-retest reliability across sessions (avg. r = .67). Latent variable analyses revealed that the Squared tasks loaded highly on a common factor (avg. loading = .70), which was strongly correlated with an attention control factor based on established measures (avg. r = .81). Moreover, attention control correlated strongly with fluid intelligence, working memory capacity, and processing speed and helped explain their covariation. We found that the Squared attention control tasks accounted for 75% of the variance in multitasking ability at the latent level, and that fluid intelligence, attention control, and processing speed fully accounted for individual differences in multitasking ability.

The findings offer valuable insights into the practices through which children assert temporary control over spaces that are considered to be communal. Teenagers employ loud music or personal belongings to mark their territory, while younger children utilise movement to establish control. Territorial production coexists with those of the adults who also frequent the site.

However, overemphasis on scores from specific instruments has significantly detracted from the original purpose of these tools. Rather than provide a definitive \"answer,\" or even a confirmation of diagnosis, standardized diagnostic instruments were designed to aid clinicians in the process of gathering information about social communication, play, and repetitive and sensory behaviors relevant to diagnosis and treatment planning. Importantly, many autism diagnostic instruments are not validated for certain patient populations, including those with severe vision, hearing, motor, and/or cognitive impairments, and they cannot be administered via a translator. In addition, certain circumstances, such as the need to wear personal protective equipment (PPE), or behavioral factors (e.g., selective mutism) may interfere with standardized administration or scoring procedures, rendering scores invalid.

Families often wait a long time and travel far to get a diagnosis for their child. To help with this problem, primary care practitioners can be trained to provide evaluations in local communities. However, usable and accurate tools developed for non-specialists are needed. The Screening Tool for Autism in Toddlers and Young Children (STAT) was created for this purpose, but limited research has been done on accuracy of the tool in community primary care. This study tested the STAT when used by primary care practitioners as part of a diagnostic evaluation in 130, 14- to 48-month-old children. We tested (1) STAT agreement with the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Second Edition (ADOS-2), and diagnosis based on an expert research evaluation, and (2) the relationship between STAT classification, primary care practitioner diagnosis, and expert diagnosis. STAT classification matched the ADOS-2 in 77% of cases and expert diagnosis in 78% of cases. Autistic children incorrectly classified by the STAT were older, had higher developmental and adaptive skills, and fewer autism symptoms. In 86% of cases, the STAT classification agreed with primary care practitioner diagnosis. STAT classification, primary care practitioner diagnosis, and expert diagnosis agreed in 73% of cases.

Adolescents having difficulties in regulating their unpleasant emotions are especially prone to Problematic Internet Use (PIU), which is why emotion dysregulation has been considered a risk factor for PIU. The aim of the present study was to assess problematic internet use (PIU) in adolescents after the third wave (nearly 1.5 years after the onset in Europe) of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the German region of Siegen-Wittgenstein, all students 12 years and older from secondary-level schools, vocational schools and universities were offered a prioritized vaccination in August 2021 with an approved vaccine against COVID-19. In this context, the participants filled out the Short Compulsive Internet Use Scale (SCIUS) and two additional items to capture a possible change in digital media usage time and regulation of negative affect due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A multiple regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of PIU. The original sample consisted of 1477 participants, and after excluding invalid cases the final sample size amounted to 1268 adolescents aged 12\u201317 (x = 14.37 years, SD = 1.64). The average prevalence of PIU was 43.69%. Gender, age, digital media usage time and the intensity of negative emotions during the COVID-19 pandemic were all found to be significant predictors of PIU: female gender, increasing age, longer digital media usage time and higher intensity of negative emotions during the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with higher SCIUS total scores. This study found a very high prevalence of PIU among 12- to 17-year-olds for the period after the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has increased significantly compared to pre-pandemic prevalence rates.

They have been employed to reveal causal links between neural activity patterns and function, and to explore therapeutic effects of electroencephalography (EEG-)guided stimulations during sleep. Most CLNS procedures are developed for a single purpose, detecting one specific pattern of interest in the EEG. Furthermore, most procedures have limited, if any, flexibility to adapt to temporal or interindividual variance in the signal, which means they wouldn\u2019t work optimally across the full physiological phenomenology. Approach Here we present a new approach to CLNS, based on real-time signal modelling to predict brain activity, allowing targeting of a broad variety of oscillatory dynamics. Intrinsic to the modelling approach is adaptation to signal variance, such that no personalization steps prior to use are necessary. We systematically assess stimulus targeting performance of modelling-based CLNS (M-CLNS), across a wide range of brain oscillation frequencies and phases in human and rodent neurophysiological signals. Main results Our results show high performance for all target phases and frequency bands, including slow oscillations, theta and alpha waves. Significance These findings highlight the general applicability and adaptability of M-CLNS, which also favors its application in populations with an atypical oscillatory signature, like clinical or elderly populations.

Our study aims to present a protocol that will assess the feasibility and provide a preliminary measure of effectiveness for an intervention using immersive CR technology for cognitive remediation (CR) in individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Methods A feasibility randomized controlled clinical study will involve 30 individuals who are over 65\u2009years old, both sex, who meet the diagnostic criteria for MCI from the University Hospital of Cagliari, randomly assigned to either the experimental condition or control group. Both groups will continue to receive standard pharmacological therapy. The experimental group will undergo a 3-months cognitive remediation program using fully immersive VR with two sessions per week. Each session will last a maximum of 60 min and will be supervised by expert health professionals. In contrast, the control group will continue with standard care. The intervention program will be carried out by s psychiatric rehabilitation technicians and speech therapists, emphasizing a comprehensive framework aligned with healthcare needs. Feasibility will be assessed based on tolerability, including dropout rates and acceptability, which considers the proportion of recruited participants among those considered eligible and on side effects and level of satisfaction.

Repeated pairings of a neutral stimulus with a negative consequence leads to the creation of a transiently threatening entity, which can be used to assess explicit and implicit ratings of fear. In fact, the use of psychophysiological indices (i.e., skin conductance responses, fear potentiated startle, pupillary responses) represents a less biased tool compared with verbal ratings, as they are harder to control voluntarily. Among those, the use of heart rate (HR) responses is on the rise, as it reveals the presence of fear-induced bradycardia, a phenomenon by which a conditioned stimulus elicits a brief cardiac deceleration upon its presentation. This stems from an intricate interplay among the central and the peripheral nervous systems, by means of the vagus nerve which extends to the heart. The neurovisceral integration model of fear (NVI-f) proposes that high level cognitive structures (i.e., prefrontal cortex) influence both the amygdala and the hippocampus, generating neurovisceral responses via projections that govern heart behaviour. Compromised functioning of those high-level structures can, thus, engender aberrant fear conditioning, which is known to lead to the development of different psychiatric disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). As these populations of patients show differences from the norm in their conditioned responses when measured by more widely used techniques, it is possible to assume that the same would be true for HR responses. This hypothesis has been investigated with a particular focus on PTSD patients (see Table 1 for a summary). Here, we aim at discussing in a single work the research endeavours made in this field. Moreover, our goal is to provide an interpretation of the various results taken together. PTSD is tightly related to second-order conditioning, a phenomenon by which a conditioned stimulus (CS) can acquire the properties of an unconditioned stimulus (US) and become a US by itself. Moreover, the affective properties of the CS can be further transferred to a second stimulus. This is actually relevant for these patients since cues related to the traumatic event can serve as a US and negatively impact on everyday life. Accordingly, to study this phenomenon, Wessa and Flor recruited trauma exposed individuals, some of which suffered from PTSD, and healthy controls. They had them undergo a fear conditioning paradigm during which one geometrical shape was followed by a picture of an airplane crash, while the other never was. Crucially, HR results showed no differences between the two CSs, in none of the groups, revealing how fear bradycardia does not emerge in situations where the US causes cognitive distress instead of a painful physical sensation. Similarly, Orr et al recruited trauma exposed individuals to partake in a fear conditioning experiment. Some of the participants satisfied the criteria for PTSD, while others did not develop the condition. Differently from the study by Wessa and Flor, the US consisted of a painful physical sensation, namely a shock delivered to the hand. The results of this experiment revealed that PTSD patients showed greater differential responses to the two CS, while non-PTSD patients did not. More specifically, PTSD patients displayed faster HR to the CS+. The authors suggest that this higher conditionability constitutes an explanation for the development of this disorder. Valuable insights can stem even from studies that consider populations with PTSD-related problems instead of the fully fledged condition. Notably, Costanzo et al focused their study not on patients but on war veterans with subthreshold PTSD. Authors hypothesised that given the characteristics of the disorder, higher symptom severity would be associated with greater conditioned responses during both acquisition and extinction. Therefore, they recruited war veterans and split them in two groups based on symptom levels, forming a low and a high symptom group. They underwent a conditional discrimination paradigm, where three different visual stimuli were presented in pairs to participants. During acquisition, the \u2018threat\u2019 pairs were presented with an air blast, and the \u2018safety\u2019 pair represented the CS . During the inhibition phase, a pair comprised of a stimulus from both previous pairs was presented to assess the ability to associate a safety signal to a threatening cue. Finally, during the extinction phase, both \u2018threat\u2019 and \u2018safety\u2019 pairs were presented unreinforced.

Methods Animal and cellular models of brain injury were constructed using isoflurane (ISO) in neonatal SD rats and primary rat neuronal cells (PRNCs). After treatment with C21, the ultrastructure and morphology of the hippocampus in the model rats were assessed using the transmission electron microscope and H&E staining.

Meanwhile, we are experiencing a digital healthcare revolution, marked by innovations in the collection and analysis of electronic health records, personal genomes, and diverse physiological measurements. Advanced technologies, including current wearable devices, integrate both active and passive (sensor-based) data collection, providing a more comprehensive view of human health.

Metformin, an oral hypoglycemic agent, has recently gained attention for its potential benefits beyond glucose regulation. It has shown promise in alleviating neuropathic and inflammatory pain, suggesting that it could offer a novel approach to managing chronic pain conditions like FM. This study aimed to further explore metformin\u2019s analgesic potential by evaluating its effects in an experimental FM model induced by reserpine in both male and female mice. After the administration of 200 mg/kg metformin to male and female mice, the FM-related symptoms were assessed, including mechanical allodynia, thermal hyperalgesia, and depressive-like behaviors. A histological examination of the thalamus, hippocampus, and spinal cord was conducted using haematoxylin and eosin staining. The neurotransmitter and proinflammatory cytokines levels were measured in the brains and spinal cords. Our results have shown that metformin treatment for seven days significantly reversed these FM-like symptoms, reducing pain sensitivity and improving mood-related behaviors in both the male and female mice. Additionally, metformin exhibited neuroprotective effects, mitigating reserpine-induced damage in the hippocampus, thalamus, and spinal cord. It also significantly lowered the levels of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 1-beta (IL-1\u03b2) in the brain and spinal cord. Notably, metformin modulated the neurotransmitter levels differently between the sexes, decreasing glutamate and increasing serotonin and norepinephrine in the male mice, but not in the females.

This review explores the different applications of play therapy in helping children with autism disorder. Play is usually significantly impaired in children with autism. Play therapy is mainly intended to help children to honor their unique mental abilities and developmental levels. The main aim of play therapy is to prevent or solve psychosocial difficulties and achieve optimal child-healthy growth and development. Play therapy helps children with autism to engage in play activities of their interest and choice to express themselves in the most comfortable ways. It changes their way of self-expression from unwanted behaviors to more non-injurious expressive behavior using toys or activities of their choice as their words. Play therapy also helps those children to experience feeling out various interaction styles. Every child with autism is unique and responds differently. Therefore, different types of intervention, like play therapy, could fit the differences in children with autism. Proper evaluation of the child is mandatory to evaluate which type fits the child more than the others. This narrative review revised the different types of play therapy that could fit children with autism in an evidence-based way.

He is otherwise healthy and was born at term after a healthy pregnancy. His primary language is Spanish, and he has minimal interactions in English. His first words were at 20 months; they were not functional but rather words related to his interests such as \"train.\" He began using 2 to 3-word phrases shortly after but only to request needs. He began speaking in complete sentences at age 4 years.A neuropsychological evaluation was conducted at age 2 years during which Juan demonstrated repetitive behaviors such as hand-flapping, toe-walking, body rocking, and head banging. He displayed sensory seeking behaviors such as rubbing items on his face and close visual inspection. He did not respond to his name and his use of eye contact was inconsistent. He demonstrated rigidity and difficulty transitioning between activities. He did not engage in social reciprocity, and his facial expressions were limited. Minimal spontaneous language was observed, and expressive language largely consisted of echolalia in both languages. Juan was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder and applied behavior analysis, speech and language therapy, and occupational therapy were recommended.Developmental-behavioral follow-up over the next 2 years noted improvements in behavior, transitions, and social interactions. He participated in early childhood intervention and early childhood special education with significant advances for speech and language in English and Spanish, demonstrating a large vocabulary. At 4 years, parents noted Juan to have reluctance to speak in English. He stopped speaking in English entirely for 3 weeks, though he continued to speak in Spanish. When he resumed speaking in English, it was only with people he knew well (e.g., parents, teachers, babysitter). In clinic, he did not speak to the English-speaking developmental-behavioral pediatrician but spoke in short sentences to the Spanish-speaking neuropsychologist.A repeat neuropsychological evaluation completed at age 5 years revealed that Juan had stopped speaking in English completely, even among those previously deemed \"safe.\" Results were consistent with average cognitive abilities with a strength in verbal skills. Juan's single-word vocabulary in Spanish was exceptionally high. He did not provide expressive responses in English, but his receptive English vocabulary was high average. He responded to English language with nonverbal gestures or spoken language in Spanish. Parents reported Juan to display increased anxiety accompanied by extreme school refusal, behavioral difficulties, and reluctance to leave the home.Given this information, what are your diagnostic considerations and treatment recommendations?", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-11-26", "synthetic_support_claim": "A bilingual child with autism spectrum disorder may regress in one language despite proficiency in another.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Bilingualism causes increased anxiety and behavioral difficulties in children with autism spectrum disorder."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "92cd1bbfb4aa55d284f446b2d240ebe191415dff", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/92cd1bbfb4aa55d284f446b2d240ebe191415dff", "title": "Empowering voices\u2014Learning From NDIS Participants About the Value of Creative and Experiential Therapies: A Mixed Methods Analysis of Testimonials and Academic Literature", "abstract": "In this study, we investigated the research question \u201cWhat is the value of creative and experiential therapies for disabled people in the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS)?\u201d The findings are intended to inform policy regarding access to creative and experiential therapies.

Few studies have examined motor difficulties in children with ASD as a function of sex or age; however, greater cognitive challenges are associated with worse general motor performance. Based on the Developmental Coordination Disorder\u2010Questionnaire (DCD\u2010Q) data from the SPARK study sample, 87%\u201388% children with ASD were at\u2010risk for a general motor impairment that persisted until 15\u2009years and was related to their core and co\u2010occurring difficulties.

Therefore, this analysis examines the effects of age, sex, and cognitive ability (presence of ID or level of cognitive delay) on the motor performance of children from the SPARK sample using the DCD\u2010Q. Except fine motor skills, multiple motor domains did not change with age in children with ASD. Females without ID improved their fine motor scores with age, and performed better compared to males without ID. Children with ASD and ID had greater motor difficulties across multiple motor domains than those without ID.

However, the imposed character limit (280 characters) by Twitter and infrequent online activities of a section of users poses a serious setback in using computational methods for mental health analysis or emotion research. Twitter provides rich metadata information about its users (such as user\u2019s description, geolocation, and profile image URL), which can provide valuable information regarding the mental state of the users. We hypothesize that Twitter\u2019s rich metadata information about their users can provide some valuable depression cues, which may help in an early low-profile evaluation. In this article, we investigate this hypothesis by developing an end-to-end multimodal multitask (MT) system for depression detection (primary task) and emotion recognition (auxiliary task), where the variation of emotion information based on different user descriptions assists the learning of the primary task. The proposed system attains 70% accuracy on the depression detection task outperforming several single-task (ST) baselines built on the various combination of input features.

Our method first extracts the features of facial expressions and pupil diameter using residual networks and 1-D convolutional neural networks. Second, a cross-modal fusion model based on self-attention networks (CMF-SNs) is proposed, which utilizes cross-modal attention networks within modalities and parallel self-attention networks between different modalities to extract CMF features of facial expressions and pupil diameter, effectively complementing information between different modalities. Finally, the obtained features are fully connected to identify depression. Multiple controlled experiments show that compared to single modality, the multimodal fusion method based on self-attention networks has a higher ability to recognize depression, with the highest accuracy of 75.0%.

Along with general information about the public, these platforms hold an ample amount of content related to depressed users and thus can generate sensitive social signals indicating if a person is suffering from some serious issues, such as self-harm, suicidal thoughts, or intention for an unlawful act. Early depression detection using advanced natural language processing (NLP), deep machine learning, and transfer learning techniques can assist in designing an efficient system to detect major depressive systems at an early stage. The current depression detection models are not enough to capture sensitive social signals indicating the true mood, personality, and behavior of an individual. Thus, making the current systems unsatisfactory. To address this life-threatening human-health problem, we propose an efficient artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL)-based model for identifying depressed individuals on social media platforms. The model employs hybrid feature-based behavioral-biometric signals captured using Word2Vec, term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) models to learn a convolutional neural network (CNN) and long-short term memory (LSTM) models. The data are captured from multiple sources using advanced crawling strategies to have data variety in the corpus. Thus, making the proposed system effective across platforms. The Dataset produced by this study is the first of its kind with a variety of depressive signals from online social network (OSN) platforms including Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube.

In this study, we asked whether recurrent DNNs could also better account for human behaviour during visual recognition. We assembled a stimulus set that included manipulations that are often associated with recurrent processing in the literature, like occlusion, partial viewing, clutter, and spatial phase scrambling. We obtained a benchmark dataset from human participants performing a categorisation task on this stimulus set. By applying a wide range of model architectures to the same task, we uncovered a nuanced relationship between recurrence, model size, and performance. While recurrent models reach higher performance than their feedforward counterpart, we could not dissociate this improvement from that obtained by increasing model size. We found consistency between humans and models patterns of difficulty across the visual manipulations, but this was not modulated in an obvious way by the specific type of recurrence or size added to the model.

Its absence helps to explain slow progress; its advent promises major advances. Instead of offering a new kind of treatment, evolutionary psychiatry provides a scientific foundation useful for all kinds of treatment. It expands the search for causes from mechanistic explanations for disease in some individuals to evolutionary explanations for traits that make all members of a species vulnerable to disease. For instance, capacities for symptoms such as pain, cough, anxiety and low mood are universal because they are useful in certain situations. Failing to recognize the utility of anxiety and low mood is at the root of many problems in psychiatry. Determining if an emotion is normal and if it is useful requires understanding an individual's life situation. Conducting a review of social systems, parallel to the review of systems in the rest of medicine, can help achieve that understanding. Coping with substance abuse is advanced by acknowledging how substances available in modern environments hijack chemically mediated learning mechanisms. Understanding why eating spirals out of control in modern environments is aided by recognizing the motivations for caloric restriction and how it arouses famine protection mechanisms that induce binge eating. Finally, explaining the persistence of alleles that cause serious mental disorders requires evolutionary explanations of why some systems are intrinsically vulnerable to failure. The thrill of finding functions for apparent diseases is evolutionary psychiatry's greatest strength and weakness. Recognizing bad feelings as evolved adaptations corrects psychiatry's pervasive mistake of viewing all symptoms as if they were disease manifestations. However, viewing diseases such as panic disorder, melancholia and schizophrenia as if they are adaptations is an equally serious mistake in evolutionary psychiatry. Progress will come from framing and testing specific hypotheses about why natural selection left us vulnerable to mental disorders.

Partial sleep deprivation (PSD) is an important risk factor for GAD development and a common comorbidity. Adolescence is a period of rapid brain and nervous system development, and during this time, the occurrence of GAD can lead to neurocognitive deficits, such as impaired attention, cognitive control, and attention bias, that significantly affect cognitive function. However, relatively little research has been conducted on GAD comorbid with PSD in early adulthood compared with other psychiatric disorders. Clinical studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of acupuncture in treating GAD and sleep disorders, but the mechanism of how acupuncture modulates neurocognitive processing in patients with GAD comorbid with PSD has not been clarified. Methods/design In this randomized clinical trial, a total of 56 participants diagnosed with GAD comorbid with naturally occurring PSD and 28 healthy controls (HCs) will be recruited. The participants diagnosed with GAD comorbid with PSD will be randomly assigned to either the acupuncture group or the sham acupuncture group at a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome measure is the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA). Secondary outcome measures are the Sleep Deprivation Index (SDI), the Self-Assessment Scale for Anxiety (SAS), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Additionally, three psychological paradigms (the attentional network test, psychomotor vigilance test, and emotional face Go/No-go) and event-related potential (ERP) data. Healthy volunteers will not undergo acupuncture but will instead participate in baseline assessments for the scales, mental paradigms, and ERP data.

Methods Data were sourced from the Chinese Adolescent Health Database, which included responses from 7,482 adolescents aged 12\u201318\u202fyears about sleep, personal physical activity, and family physical activity. Using two-stage least squares (2-SLS), we examined the relationship between adolescent sleep, personal physical activity, and father\u2019s physical activity habits (as instrumental variables). A mediating variable, family physical behavior, was introduced to investigate causal pathways. Results 2-SLS regression revealed a significant positive correlation between physical activity and sleep quality (\u03b2\u202f= 0.052, p<0.01). With the inclusion of the instrumental variable (father\u2019s physical activity habits), the effect size increased to 0.208 (p<0.01). Adding family physical behavior as a mediating variable further increased the coefficient by 0.1437. The analysis showed that 84.62% of the total effect of physical activity on sleep was mediated, while the direct effect accounted for only 15.53%. Both F-statistics were significant.

Little is known about how eating disorder clinicians perceive the utility of the diagnosis, and what changes they believe would add to that utility.

Results Over 27% of clinicians advocated removing the AAN diagnosis or combining it with Anorexia Nervosa, while nearly 15% reported concerns about the requirement for \u2018significant weight loss\u2019. Over 87% of clinicians suggested ways (often inconsistent across clinicians) to define \u2018significant weight loss\u2019, with emphasis on the need for a specified rate (i.e., amount of loss/time) and consideration of physical health impacts.

They occur along a spectrum of disordered eating and compensatory weight management behaviors, and from low to high body weight. Psychiatric comorbidities are the norm. In contrast to other major psychiatric disorders, first-line treatments for FEDs are mainly psychological and/or nutrition-focused, with medications playing a minor adjunctive role. Patients, carers and clinicians all have identified personalization of treatment as a priority. Yet, for all FEDs, the evidence base supporting this personalization is limited. Importantly, disordered eating and related behaviors can have serious physical consequences and may put the patient's life at risk. In these cases, immediate safety and risk management considerations may at least for a period need to be prioritized over other efforts at personalization of care. This paper systematically reviews several key domains that may be relevant to the characterization of the individual patient with a FED aimed at personalization of management. These domains include symptom profile, clinical subtypes, severity, clinical staging, physical complications and consequences, antecedent and concomitant psychiatric conditions, social functioning and quality of life, neurocognition, social cognition and emotion, dysfunctional cognitive schemata, personality traits, family history, early environmental exposures, recent environmental exposures, stigma, and protective factors. Where possible, validated assessment measures for use in clinical practice are identified. The limitations of the current evidence are pointed out, and possible directions for future research are highlighted.

However, the existing multi-modal fake news detection models only fuse the visual and textual features after the encoder, failing to effectively utilize the multi-modal contextual relationships and resulting in insufficient feature fusion. Moreover, most fake news detection algorithms focus on mining news content and overlook the users' preferences whether to spread fake news.\nOBJECTIVES: The model uses the multi-modal context relationship when extracting model features, and combines with user features to assist in mining multi-modal information to improve the performance of fake news detection.\nMETHODS: A fake news detection model called MFUIE (Multimodal Feature and User Information Enhancement) is proposed, which utilizes multi-modal features and user information enhancement. Firstly, for news content, we utilize the pre-trained language model BERT to encode sentences. At the same time, we use the Swin Transformer model as the main framework and introduce textual features during the early visual feature encoding to enhance semantic interactions. Additionally, we employ InceptionNetV3 as the image pattern analyser. Secondly, for user's historical posts, we use the same model as the news text to encode them, and introduce GAT (Graph Attention Network) to enhance information interaction between post nodes, capturing user-specific features. Finally, we fuse the obtained user features with the multi-modal features and validate the performance of the model.\nRESULTS: The proposed model's performance is compared with those of existing methods. MFUIE model achieves an accuracy of 0.926 and 0.935 on the Weibo dataset and Weibo-21 dataset, respectively. F1 on Weibo is 0.926, 0.017 greater than SOAT model BRM; while F1 on Weibo-21 is 0.935, 0.009 greater than that of BRM.\nCONCLUSION: Experimental results demonstrate that MFUIE can improve the fake news recognition in some degree.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-12-12", "synthetic_support_claim": "MFUIE model achieves an accuracy of 0.926 and 0.935 on the Weibo and Weibo-21 datasets.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "The model significantly outperforms all existing methods in every evaluated metric of fake news detection."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "10a776a1f0837e3af6816711c3fb68a1f584298e", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/10a776a1f0837e3af6816711c3fb68a1f584298e", "title": "The Impact of Implicit-Bias-Oriented Diversity Training on Police Officers\u2019 Beliefs, Motivations, and Actions", "abstract": "U.S. police departments have attempted to address racial inequities in policing with diversity training.

However, the relative importance of each emotion as a predictor of FL performance has yet to be examined, and as different teaching and learning strategies can elicit different emotions, it is difficult to determine whether FL teachers and learners should prioritize a specific emotion in course design and study. We, therefore, utilized structural equation modeling and latent dominance analysis on a sample of 502 Moroccan EFL learners in order to examine the relative importance of each emotion in predicting FL performance.

However, most studies in this area have used relatively small monocentric data and focused on a limited range of EEG features, making it difficult to compare the utility of different sets of EEG features for emotion recognition. This study addressed that by comparing the classification accuracy (performance) of a comprehensive range of EEG feature sets for identifying emotional states, in terms of valence and arousal. The classification accuracy of five EEG feature sets were investigated, including statistical features, fractal dimension (FD), Hjorth parameters, higher order spectra (HOS), and those derived using wavelet analysis. Performance was evaluated using two classifier methods, support vector machine (SVM) and classification and regression tree (CART), across five independent and publicly available datasets linking EEG to emotional states: MAHNOB-HCI, DEAP, SEED, AMIGOS, and DREAMER.

Social camouflaging was first shown to be a characteristic of autistic persons, who actively try to disguise and compensate for their autism features in social contexts in an effort to socially blend in better. Recently, an increasing, though still insufficient, number of studies has been conducted on the concept of camouflage; however, different aspect of it, from psychopathology and etiology to its complications and consequences, are not clearly defined. We aimed to systematically review the existing literature on camouflage in autistic adults to describe the correlates of camouflage, motivations for exhibiting camouflage behavior, and the potential impacts of camouflage on the mental health of autistic individuals. Methods We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist guidelines to conduct a systematic review. The databases of PubMed and Scopus, and PsycInfo were searched for eligible studies. Studies were published between January 1st, 1980, to April 1st, 2022. Results We included 16 articles, of which four studies were qualitative and 11 were quantitative. One study used a mix method. The assessment tools used for camouflage, the correlates of camouflage including autism severity, gender, age, cognitive profile and neuroanatomical correlates, reasons for camouflage and the impacts of camouflaging behavior on mental health are discussed in this review. Discussion In synthesizing the literature, we conclude that camouflage seems to be more common among females who report more autistic symptoms themselves. There may also be some differences between men and women in reasons of exhibiting it and its neuroanatomical correlates. Further research is needed as to why this phenomenon is more prevalent in females with implications for gender related cognitive and neuroanatomical differences. Effects of camouflage on mental health and daily life measures of individuals such as employment, university graduation, relationship, financial status, and quality of life should be studied with more details in future studies.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-03-16", "synthetic_support_claim": "Camouflage is more common among females with autism who report more autistic symptoms themselves.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Camouflaging behavior in autistic adults directly increases their likelihood of achieving higher social status."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "ca3a2363c976ea1d2fc5982e5cf04c1c754a9baa", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ca3a2363c976ea1d2fc5982e5cf04c1c754a9baa", "title": "2q13 Distal Microdeletion: Considering Evidence for an Emerging Syndrome Versus Susceptibility Locus: Twenty-Five New Cases and Review of the Literature.", "abstract": "This study investigates distal 2q13 microdeletion, presenting the largest cohort to date, including prenatal cases, alongside a comprehensive literature review.

However, diagnosis is typically delayed for assigned females at birth (AFAB) and gender-diverse individuals, with their autism-related struggles being overlooked. The current study utilizes semistructured interviews with autistic adults to explore how gender identity and socialization impact diagnostic odysseys. As such, we examined the following research questions: (1) What are the female and nonbinary experiences of pursuing an autism diagnosis, and how do they provide an alternative narrative to a normative male experience? (2) What was the experience like receiving and coping with an autism diagnosis? Qualitative interviews were conducted with 24 autistic adults identifying as nonbinary, agender, or genderfluid ( n\u2009=\u200914), female ( n\u2009=\u20098), and male ( n\u2009=\u20092). Coding used reflexive thematic analysis, informed by tenants of gender socialization roles and the feminist disability model. Participants reported experiencing clinician bias within the mental health system, being mislabeled, having difficulties navigating the diagnostic system, and masking to compensate prior to diagnosis. This study provides a greater understanding of diagnostic trajectories and the intersection of gender socialization with their coping strategies for navigating life without a diagnosis. This informs future practices in reducing diagnostic biases and the toll of compensatory mechanisms used in the interim. Early diagnosis of autism can greatly improve the lives of those affected. However, for individuals assigned female at birth (AFAB) and those who are gender diverse, this diagnosis often comes much later. This delay is because their autism-related challenges are frequently overlooked by healthcare professionals. Our study aimed to understand how gender identity and social experiences influence the journey to receiving an autism diagnosis. We interviewed 24 autistic adults to learn about their personal experiences. Among them, 14 identified as nonbinary, agender, or genderfluid, 8 as female, and 2 as male. We wanted to know how their gender affected their pursuit of a diagnosis and how they coped with life before and after being diagnosed. Participants shared that they often faced bias from clinicians, were misdiagnosed, and had trouble navigating the diagnostic system. Many also talked about \u201cmasking\u201d their autism symptoms to fit in, which was exhausting and challenging. Our findings highlight the unique struggles these individuals face and show how gender socialization plays a role in their experiences.

This challenge requires developing new benchmarks and methods for quantifying affective and semantic bias, keeping in mind that LLMs act as psycho-social mirrors that reflect the views and tendencies that are prevalent in society. One such tendency that has harmful negative effects is the global phenomenon of anxiety toward math and STEM subjects. In this study, we introduce a novel application of network science and cognitive psychology to understand biases towards math and STEM fields in LLMs from ChatGPT, such as GPT-3, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4.

We use data obtained by probing the three LLMs in a language generation task that has previously been applied to humans. Our findings indicate that LLMs have negative perceptions of math and STEM fields, associating math with negative concepts in 6 cases out of 10.

The dataset consists of 756,000 datapoints, counting 300 iterations repeated across 15 academic events, 2 biological genders, 2 career levels and 42 unique item responses of the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-42). PhDGPT integrates these psychometric scores with their explanations in plain language. This synergy of scores and texts offers a dual, comprehensive perspective on the emotional well-being of simulated academics, e.g. male/female PhD students or professors. By combining network psychometrics and psycholinguistic dimensions, this study identifies several similarities and distinctions between human and LLM data. The psychometric networks of simulated male professors do not differ between physical and emotional anxiety subscales, unlike humans. Other LLMs' personification can reconstruct human DASS factors with a purity up to 80%. Furthemore, LLM-generated personifications across different scenarios are found to elicit explanations lower in concreteness and imageability in items coding for anxiety, in agreement with past studies about human psychology. Our findings indicate an advanced yet incomplete ability for LLMs to reproduce the complexity of human psychometric data, unveiling convenient advantages and limitations in using LLMs to replace human participants.

This recent finding has promoted research on how cerebellar damage affects the development of the cerebral cortex, the brain region responsible for higher\u2010order control of all behaviours. However, the cerebral cortex is not directly connected to the cerebellum. The thalamus is a major direct target of the cerebellar nuclei, conveying cerebellar signals to the cerebral cortex. Despite its crucial position in cerebello\u2013cerebral interaction, thalamic susceptibility to cerebellar damage remains largely unclear. Here, we studied the consequences of early cerebellar perturbation on thalamic development. Whole\u2010cell patch\u2010clamp recordings showed that the synaptic organization of the cerebellothlamic circuit is similar to that of the primary sensory thalamus, in which aberrant sensory activity alters synaptic circuit formation. The ablation of Purkinje cells in the developing cerebellum strengthened cerebellothalamic synapses and enhanced thalamic suprathreshold activities. Purkinje\u2010cell specific deletion of tuberous sclerosis complex subunit 1 (Tsc1), an autism\u2010associated gene for which the protein product negatively regulates the mammalian target of rapamycin, also strengthened cerebellothalamic synapses. However, this strengthening occurred only in homozygous deletion, whereas both homozygous and hemizygous deletion are known to cause autism\u2010like behaviours. These results suggest that, although the cerebellothalamic projection is vulnerable to disturbances in the developing cerebellar cortex, other changes may also drive the behavioural consequences of early cerebellar perturbation. Key points Cerebellar damage early in life often causes motor, social and cognitive impairments, suggesting the roles of the cerebellum in developing a broad spectrum of behaviours. Recent studies focus on how the developing cerebellum affects the formation and function of the cerebral cortex, the higher\u2010order centre for all behaviours. However, the cerebellum does not directly connect to the cerebral cortex. Here, we studied the consequences of early cerebellar perturbation on the thalamus because it is a direct postsynaptic target of the cerebellum, sending cerebellar signals to the cerebral cortex. Loss of cerebellar Purkinje cells, which are commonly associated with various neurological disorders, strengthened cerebellothalamic synapses, suggesting the vulnerability of the thalamus to substantial disturbance in the developing cerebellum. Purkinje cell\u2010specific loss of tuberous sclerosis complex\u20101, a negative regulator of mammalian target of rapamycin, is an established mouse model of autism.

Additionally, despite the benefits of empathy for prosocial behaviors and protection against antisocial behaviors, most research has considered the contribution of specific practices (e.g., reasoning or power assertion), but not so much the parenting styles. Similarly, family studies tend to study the relationship between parenting and global self-perceptions (self-esteem), but not so much those of each dimension (self-concept). Methods In the present study, 600 Spanish adolescents from 12 to 17\u2009years old (M\u2009=\u200915.25, SD\u2009=\u20092.01) were classified within one of the four household typologies (i.e., authoritative, indulgent, authoritarian, or neglectful). Adolescent developmental outcomes were cognitive empathy (adopting perspectives and emotional understanding), emotional empathy (empathic stress and empathic happiness), and self-concept (academic, social, emotional, family and physical). Results The results showed that the indulgent parenting (warmth but not strictness) was related to equal or even better empathy and self-concept than the authoritative style (warmth and strictness), whereas non-warm parenting (authoritarian and neglectful) was consistently associated with poor results. Discussion Overall, the present findings seriously question that parental strictness combined with parental warmth (authoritative style) is always the parenting style related to the greatest outcomes. By contrast, it seems that reasoning, warmth and involvement, without strictness (indulgent parenting) help adolescents to achieve a good orientation toward others in terms of cognitive and affective empathy and a good self-evaluation in terms of self-concept.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-12-05", "synthetic_support_claim": "Indulgent parenting is associated with better empathy and self-concept outcomes than authoritative parenting.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Authoritarian parenting style results in better developmental outcomes than authoritative or indulgent parenting styles."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "6bf32a46f4f4503cf1f8dcc249df88c27f1ea236", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6bf32a46f4f4503cf1f8dcc249df88c27f1ea236", "title": "Parental Socialization Based on Warmth and Strictness Among Adolescents and Young Adults: Which Parenting Dimension is Related to Greater Adjustment?", "abstract": "The present study aims to examine parental socialization and adjustment in adolescents and adult children.

Parental socialization was assessed through warmth and strictness. Child adjustment was assessed though self-esteem, emotional self-concept, nervousness, and achievement values. Correlation and regression analyses were conducted. Results from predictive models revealed that warmth and strictness were significant predictors of child adjustment, although they showed different directionality. Parental warmth was always identified as a significant predictor: the higher the parental warmth, the higher the emotional self-concept, self-esteem, and achievement, and the lower the nervousness. On the contrary, parental strictness did not predict adjustment and was even a significantly negative predictor of self-esteem and emotional self-concept. In addition and contrary to classical findings from mostly European-American samples, the present findings seem to suggest that parental strictness is unnecessary or even detrimental, while parental warmth offers a significant and beneficial contribution to adjustment.

This scoping review aimed to investigate and map these barriers and facilitators that physiotherapists working in primary care reportedly face when treating patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain from a biopsychosocial perspective. Four electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, CINAHL and ERIC) and the grey literature were searched. Studies were included if they investigated the experiences of physiotherapists in the treatment of chronic pain from a biopsychosocial perspective in primary care. Extracted data were discussed and sub grouped in themes following a qualitative content analysis approach.

Results: Two major themes emerged from interviews with individuals with dizziness: (1.) complexities navigating the health system and (2.) loss of self-identity. Three major themes emerged from interviews with vestibular physical therapists: (1.) patients have a complex, multi-factorial presentation, (2.) importance of the multidisciplinary care team, and (3.) behavior influences outcomes. Individuals with chronic dizziness identified many challenges in effectively navigating the health system and receiving an effective diagnosis and management, including the patient\u2013provider relationship, with negative impacts on quality of life.

Physical therapy is a recommended treatment modality for managing this kind of pain. Yet, there is still limited knowledge regarding how physiotherapists experience, manage, and follow up this patient population.\n\n\nPURPOSE\nThis qualitative study aimed to explore the experiences of physiotherapists in Norwegian primary healthcare working with adolescents experiencing persistent pain. The study examined the resources the therapists make use of, and the challenges they encounter.\n\n\nMETHOD\nFour focus group interviews were conducted with a total of 13 Norwegian physiotherapists experienced in treating adolescents with persistent pain. The interviews explored the physiotherapists' experiences of working with adolescents with persistent pain.

The experiences of physiotherapists show the importance of a strong therapeutic alliance and individualized treatment approaches, based on shared decision-making and age-appropriate communication and interventions. The therapists in our study emphasized the need to integrate interventions into the adolescents' everyday lives, tailoring treatments to the unique life of each individual.

Emerging evidence suggests that cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) may reduce suicidal ideation (SI). However, the role of digital therapeutics in both the alleviation and prevention of SI remains unclear, and treatment mechanisms facilitating SI reductions have not been clearly identified.\n\n\nMETHOD\n658 adults with DSM-5 insomnia disorder enrolled into a single-site randomized controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of digital CBTI relative to attention control. Outcomes were measured at pretreatment, posttreatment, and 1-year follow-up.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBefore treatment, 126 patients endorsed SI (19.1% prevalence). Among those with baseline SI, CBTI patients reported lower SI rates at posttreatment (30.0% vs 54.5%, p=.005) and 1-year follow-up (29.6% vs 46.8%, p=.042) relative to control. PRODCLIN analysis estimated that half of suicidolytic effects of CBTI were mediated through insomnia remission. Among those without baseline SI, CBTI did not directly prevent new onset SI. However, insomnia remitters reported lower rates of new onset SI at posttreatment relative to non-remitters (1.5% vs 6.5%, p=.009). Mediation analysis supported a significant indirect effect wherein CBTI increased likelihood of insomnia remission, which was associated with SI prevention (\u03b1\u03b2=-3.13=5, 95%CI=-5.28, -0.96).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nDigital CBTI reduces insomnia symptoms, which promotes SI alleviation and prevention.

Primary outcomes were severity scores for PTSD, alcohol use, and drug use, estimated via moderated nonlinear factor analysis. Propensity score weight-adjusted multilevel models were used. Model-predicted effect sizes were estimated for each treatment, and comparative effect sizes for each active arm against treatment as usual, at end of treatment and at 12-month follow-up.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCompared with treatment as usual, combining trauma-focused therapy and pharmacotherapy for substance use disorders showed the largest comparative effect sizes for PTSD severity (d=-0.92, 95% CI=-1.57, -0.30) and alcohol use severity (d=-1.10, 95% CI=-1.54, -0.68) at end of treatment.

Furthermore, in analogy to lesion studies, phantom perception may serve as a vehicle to understand the fundamental processing principles underlying healthy auditory perception. With a special focus on tinnitus\u2014as the prime example of auditory phantom perception\u2014we review recent work at the intersection of artificial intelligence, psychology and neuroscience. In particular, we discuss why everyone with tinnitus suffers from (at least hidden) hearing loss, but not everyone with hearing loss suffers from tinnitus. We argue that intrinsic neural noise is generated and amplified along the auditory pathway as a compensatory mechanism to restore normal hearing based on adaptive stochastic resonance. The neural noise increase can then be misinterpreted as auditory input and perceived as tinnitus. This mechanism can be formalized in the Bayesian brain framework, where the percept (posterior) assimilates a prior prediction (brain\u2019s expectations) and likelihood (bottom-up neural signal). A higher mean and lower variance (i.e. enhanced precision) of the likelihood shifts the posterior, evincing a misinterpretation of sensory evidence, which may be further confounded by plastic changes in the brain that underwrite prior predictions. Hence, two fundamental processing principles provide the most explanatory power for the emergence of auditory phantom perceptions: predictive coding as a top-down and adaptive stochastic resonance as a complementary bottom-up mechanism. We conclude that both principles also play a crucial role in healthy auditory perception.

As a result, researchers have tried to explain perceptual and potential neural aberrations in tinnitus within a more parsimonious predictive-coding framework. In two independent magnetoencephalography studies, participants passively listened to sequences of pure tones with varying levels of regularity (i.e. predictability) ranging from random to ordered.

These data strongly suggest that individuals with tinnitus engage anticipatory auditory predictions differently to controls.

Using logistic regression, we investigated the association of depression and PMHDs with CVD and suboptimal CVH, adjusting for sociodemographic factors (and cardiovascular risk factors for the CVD outcome). Of the 593\u2009616 participants (mean age, 34.7\u00b19.0\u2009years), the weighted prevalence of depression was 19.6% (95% CI, 19.4\u201319.8), and the weighted prevalence of CVD was 2.5% (95% CI, 2.4\u20132.6). People with depression had higher odds of CVD than those without depression (odds ratio [OR], 2.32 [95% CI, 2.13\u20132.51]). There was a graded association of PMHDs with CVD. Compared with individuals with 0 PMHDs, the odds of CVD in those with 1 to 13 PMHDs and 14 to 30 PHMDs were 1.48 (95% CI, 1.34\u20131.62) and 2.29 (95% CI, 2.08\u20132.51), respectively, after adjusting for sociodemographic and cardiovascular risk factors.

Such evidence indicated that emotional facial expressions do not automatically influence motor responses in healthy young adults, but they do so only when intrinsically pertinent to the ongoing subject\u2019s goals. Given the theoretical relevance of these findings, it is essential to assess their generalizability to different, socially relevant emotional stimuli such as emotional body postures. To address this issue, we compared the performance of 36 right-handed participants in two different versions of a Go/No-go task. In the Emotional Discrimination task, participants were required to withhold their responses at the display of emotional body postures (fearful or happy) and to move at the presentation of neutral postures. Differently, in the control task, the same images were shown, but participants had to respond according to the color of the actor/actress\u2019 t-shirt, disregarding the emotional content. Results showed that participants made more commission errors (instances in which they moved even though the No-go signal was presented) for happy than fearful body postures in the Emotional Discrimination task.

They occur along a spectrum of disordered eating and compensatory weight management behaviors, and from low to high body weight. Psychiatric comorbidities are the norm. In contrast to other major psychiatric disorders, first-line treatments for FEDs are mainly psychological and/or nutrition-focused, with medications playing a minor adjunctive role. Patients, carers and clinicians all have identified personalization of treatment as a priority. Yet, for all FEDs, the evidence base supporting this personalization is limited. Importantly, disordered eating and related behaviors can have serious physical consequences and may put the patient's life at risk. In these cases, immediate safety and risk management considerations may at least for a period need to be prioritized over other efforts at personalization of care. This paper systematically reviews several key domains that may be relevant to the characterization of the individual patient with a FED aimed at personalization of management. These domains include symptom profile, clinical subtypes, severity, clinical staging, physical complications and consequences, antecedent and concomitant psychiatric conditions, social functioning and quality of life, neurocognition, social cognition and emotion, dysfunctional cognitive schemata, personality traits, family history, early environmental exposures, recent environmental exposures, stigma, and protective factors. Where possible, validated assessment measures for use in clinical practice are identified. The limitations of the current evidence are pointed out, and possible directions for future research are highlighted.

The climate crisis is an intergenerational inequity, with the current generation of young people exposed to more climate events over their lifetime than any previous one. Despite this injustice, research and policy to date lacks AYP\u2019s perspectives and active engagement. Methods Participatory, youth co-led qualitative focus group discussions were held in Bangladesh, Guatemala and Nigeria in mid-2023. A total of 196 AYP ages 12\u201325 years participated. Open-ended questions elicited responses regarding AYP knowledge, experiences and perceptions of climate change. Using NVivo software, translated transcripts were coded to explore and synthesise key thematic areas. Results Respondents discussed varied climate exposures and associated health risks, for example, how flooding events were impeding access to sexual and reproductive health commodities. Acute climate events like flooding and cyclones increased perceived risk of early marriage and gender-based violence in Bangladesh and Guatemala. In Nigeria, respondents discussed health effects of extreme heat, and how droughts were shifting women into more traditionally male roles in agriculture and income-generating activities, increasing the perceived risk of household tensions and gender-based violence. Commonly reported themes included perceived climate impacts on sexual and reproductive health including early marriage or gender-based violence. Another common theme was anxiety about climate change, its effects on economic and food insecurity in communities and feeling hopeless, lacking agency and not feeling supported by local institutions, all linked with worse mental health.

Objective This study aims to examine the utility of data from consumer-grade, digital, wearable devices (including smartphones or wrist-worn devices) for remotely monitoring or predicting changes in mental or physical health among adults with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Studies were included that passively collected physiological data (including sleep duration, heart rate, sleep and wake patterns, or physical activity) for at least 3 days. Research-grade actigraphy methods and physically obtrusive devices were excluded. Methods We conducted a systematic review of the following databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Technology Assessment, AMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine), APA PsycINFO, Embase, MEDLINE(R), and IEEE XPlore. Searches were completed in May 2024. Results were synthesized narratively due to study heterogeneity and divided into the following phenotypes: physical activity, sleep and circadian rhythm, and heart rate. Results Overall, 23 studies were included that reported data from 12 distinct studies, mostly using smartphones and centered on relapse prevention. Only 1 study explicitly aimed to address physical health outcomes among people with SMI. In total, data were included from over 500 participants with SMI, predominantly from high-income countries. Most commonly, papers presented physical activity data (n=18), followed by sleep and circadian rhythm data (n=14) and heart rate data (n=6). The use of smartwatches to support data collection were reported by 8 papers; the rest used only smartphones. There was some evidence that lower levels of activity, higher heart rates, and later and irregular sleep onset times were associated with psychiatric diagnoses or poorer symptoms. However, heterogeneity in devices, measures, sampling and statistical approaches complicated interpretation. Conclusions Consumer-grade wearables show the ability to passively detect digital markers indicative of psychiatric symptoms or mental health status among people with SMI, but few are currently using these to address physical health inequalities. The digital phenotyping field in psychiatry would benefit from moving toward agreed standards regarding data descriptions and outcome measures and ensuring that valuable temporal data provided by wearables are fully exploited.

We investigated the efficacy of smartphone problem-solving therapy and behavioral activation applications in breast cancer survivors. METHODS This was a decentralized randomized trial. Participants were disease-free breast cancer survivors age 20-49 years who were randomly assigned to the smartphone-based intervention or waitlist control. Both groups received treatment as usual. The control group could access the smartphone apps during weeks 8-24. The intervention comprised smartphone problem-solving therapy and behavioral activation apps. The primary end point was the Concerns About Recurrence Scale at week 8. Secondary outcomes included the Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory-Short Form (FCRI-SF), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Short-form Supportive Care Needs Survey (SCNS-SF34), and the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory at weeks 8 and 24 (trial registration: UMIN-CTR: UMIN000031140).

FCR was the primary focus/measure in 19 Studies, in 9 studies FCR was a secondary/related outcome/measure. Overall, the evidence of efficacy of web-based interventions on FCR is mixed. Conclusions The existing research suggests several key points for producing more robust evidence about the effectiveness of web-based interventions for FCR. First, the studies suggest that it is a priority to better define eligibility criteria to proactively include people with higher levels of FCR. Second, there is a need for longer-term follow-up and outcome measuring period. Third, research examining the reasons for dropout from web-based interventions for FCR is critical to improve the effectiveness of web-based interventions. Fourth, while web-based interventions do not involve the costs of transportation, traveling time, space, equipment, cleaning, and other expenses, further cost utility analyses should be performed. Finally, future studies should assess how intervention accessibility, adherence, and effectiveness can be improved across different intervention designs, varying from intensive synchronous individual therapist-assisted web-based programme to blended designs combining the advantages of face-to-face and internet-based elements, to entirely self-managed programmes. Implications for cancer survivors Developing and evaluating more accessible FCR treatments have been identified among top international FCR research priorities (Shaw et al. 2021). While there is some evidence that web-based interventions can be as effective as face-to-face interventions, currently there is a dearth of systematic data about the ways in which the web-based modality specifically can enhance supportive care for FCR. Developing knowledge about effective web-based interventions has implications for cancer survivors as they can be presented with more accessible, low-cost and low-burden options for managing fear of cancer recurrence.", "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-11-08", "synthetic_support_claim": "There is mixed evidence on the effectiveness of web-based interventions for fear of cancer recurrence.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Web-based interventions are superior to face-to-face interventions for managing fear of cancer recurrence."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "c7077f60d3097ff926feef5e3234735c282b6545", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c7077f60d3097ff926feef5e3234735c282b6545", "title": "A Smartphone App for the Management of Postoperative Home Recovery After Thoracic Surgery Procedures: A Pilot Study Using the Care4Today\u2122 App", "abstract": "Background/Objectives: In recent years, the use of smartphones has significantly increased among populations of almost every age. The aim of our work is to analyze the impact of an application (app) that follows up with the progress of a patient who underwent a thoracic surgery procedure in the first 30 days after discharge. Methods: We prospectively analyzed all the patients included in the pilot study from March 2023 to September 2023. The Care4Today\u2122 app was downloaded and activated by the patient preoperatively. From the day of discharge, the app sent questions related to pain perception, breathing capacity, general clinical conditions, problems with surgical wound and quality of life. In the case of negative responses, clinical staff received an email with an orange (medium problem) or red (serious problem) alert. Results: Among the 96 patients who were included, 82 eventually downloaded and used the app. The mean age of the patients was 60.7 years (range 19\u201380), and 43 (52.4%) were female. Minimally invasive techniques (VATS or RATS) were used in 76 cases (92.7%). The mean length of in-hospital stay was 5.3 days. Malignancy was the reason for surgery in 66 cases (80.5%). The answer rate was 75.8%. A total of 698 orange alerts and 52 red alerts were sent by the app. Re-hospitalization was needed in two cases (only one case related to our surgical procedure). The app was globally judged as useful in the management of convalescence (with an average rating of 7.4 out of 10). Age was not related to the completion rate of answers. Conclusions: The use of the app Care4Today could prevent unexpected re-hospitalization and possible complications.

The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated this problem, and digital tools have been proposed as a solution. Objective We aimed to present the development, feasibility, and potential effectiveness of Vickybot, a chatbot aimed at screening, monitoring, and reducing anxiety-depressive symptoms and work-related burnout, and detecting suicide risk in patients from PC and health care workers. Methods Healthy controls (HCs) tested Vickybot for reliability. For the simulation study, HCs used Vickybot for 2 weeks to simulate different clinical situations. For feasibility and effectiveness study, people consulting PC or health care workers with mental health problems used Vickybot for 1 month. Self-assessments for anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item) and depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) symptoms and work-related burnout (based on the Maslach Burnout Inventory) were administered at baseline and every 2 weeks. Feasibility was determined from both subjective and objective user-engagement indicators (UEIs). Potential effectiveness was measured using paired 2-tailed t tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank test for changes in self-assessment scores. Results Overall, 40 HCs tested Vickybot simultaneously, and the data were reliably transmitted and registered. For simulation, 17 HCs (n=13, 76% female; mean age 36.5, SD 9.7 years) received 98.8% of the expected modules. Suicidal alerts were received correctly. For the feasibility and potential effectiveness study, 34 patients (15 from PC and 19 health care workers; 76% [26/34] female; mean age 35.3, SD 10.1 years) completed the first self-assessments, with 100% (34/34) presenting anxiety symptoms, 94% (32/34) depressive symptoms, and 65% (22/34) work-related burnout. In addition, 27% (9/34) of patients completed the second self-assessment after 2 weeks of use. No significant differences were found between the first and second self-assessments for anxiety (t8=1.000; P=.34) or depressive (t8=0.40; P=.70) symptoms. However, work-related burnout scores were moderately reduced (z=\u22122.07, P=.04, r=0.32). There was a nonsignificant trend toward a greater reduction in anxiety-depressive symptoms and work-related burnout with greater use of the chatbot. Furthermore, 9% (3/34) of patients activated the suicide alert, and the research team promptly intervened with successful outcomes. Vickybot showed high subjective UEI (acceptability, usability, and satisfaction), but low objective UEI (completion, adherence, compliance, and engagement). Vickybot was moderately feasible. Conclusions The chatbot was useful in screening for the presence and severity of anxiety and depressive symptoms, and for detecting suicidal risk. Potential effectiveness was shown to reduce work-related burnout but not anxiety or depressive symptoms. Subjective perceptions of use contrasted with low objective-use metrics.

At present, anxiety disorders are regarded as the most widespread psychiatric disorders globally. Medication and different types of psychotherapies are employed as the primary therapeutic modalities in clinical practice for the treatment of anxiety disorders. However, combining these two approaches is known to yield more significant benefits than medication alone. Nevertheless, there is a lack of resources and a limited availability of psychotherapy options in underdeveloped areas. Psychotherapy methods encompass relaxation techniques, controlled breathing exercises, visualization exercises, controlled exposure exercises, and cognitive interventions such as challenging negative thoughts. These methods are vital in the treatment of anxiety disorders, but executing them proficiently can be demanding. Moreover, individuals with distinct anxiety disorders are prescribed medications that may cause withdrawal symptoms in some instances. Additionally, there is inadequate availability of face-to-face psychotherapy and a restricted capacity to predict and monitor the health, behavioral, and environmental aspects of individuals with anxiety disorders during the initial phases. In recent years, there has been notable progress in developing and utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) based applications and environments to improve the precision and sensitivity of diagnosing and treating various categories of anxiety disorders.

Five electronic databases (CINAHL, PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science and Scopus) were systematically searched. Seventy\u2010eight studies were identified, critically appraised and synthesised following a comprehensive integrative approach. We found that AI applications with potential use in mental health nursing vary widely from machine learning algorithms to natural language processing, digital phenotyping, computer vision and conversational agents for assessing, diagnosing and treating mental health challenges. Five overarching themes were identified: assessment, identification, prediction, optimisation and perception reflecting the multiple levels of embedding AI\u2010driven technologies in mental health nursing practice, and how patients and staff perceive the use of AI in clinical settings. We concluded that AI\u2010driven technologies hold great potential for enhancing mental health nursing practice.

Equipped with commonsense knowledge, current approaches to empathetic response generation focus on capturing implicit emotion within dialogue context, where the emotions are treated as a static variable throughout the conversations. However, emotions change dynamically between utterances, which makes previous works difficult to perceive the emotion flow and predict the correct emotion of the target response, leading to inappropriate response. Furthermore, simply importing commonsense knowledge without harmonization may trigger the conflicts between knowledge and emotion, which confuse the model to choose incorrect information to guide the generation process. To address the above problems, we propose a Serial Encoding and Emotion-Knowledge interaction (SEEK) method for empathetic dialogue generation. We use a fine-grained encoding strategy which is more sensitive to the emotion dynamics (emotion flow) in the conversations to predict the emotion-intent characteristic of response.

Analyzing 11,117 distinct graph-structured planning tasks, we find that our framework justifies several existing heuristics for task decomposition and makes predictions that can be distinguished from two alternative normative accounts. We report a behavioral study of task decomposition (N = 806) that uses 30 randomly sampled graphs, a larger and more diverse set than that of any previous behavioral study on this topic.

To address this gap and move towards a more naturalistic study of planning, we present a novel spatial Maze Search Task (MST) where the costs and rewards are physically situated as distances and locations. We used this task in two behavioral experiments to evaluate and contrast multiple distinct computational models of planning, including optimal expected utility planning, several one-step heuristics inspired by studies of information search, and a family of planners that deviate from optimal planning, in which action values are estimated by the interactions between perception and cognition. We found that people\u2019s deviations from optimal expected utility are best explained by planners with a limited horizon, however our results do not exclude the possibility that in human planning action values may be also affected by cognitive mechanisms of numerosity and probability perception.

However, studies investigating how humans accomplish this tend to focus on naive participants engaged in simplistic tasks with small state-spaces, which do not reflect the intricacy, ecological validity, and human specialisation in real-world planning. In this study, we examine the street-by-street route planning of London taxi drivers navigating across more than 26,000 streets in London (UK). We explore how planning unfolded dynamically over different phases of journey construction and identify theoretic principles by which these expert human planners rationally precache decisions at prioritised environment states in an early phase of the planning process. In particular, we find that measures of path complexity predict human mental sampling prioritisation dynamics independent of alternative measures derived from the real spatial context being navigated. Our data provide real-world evidence for complexity-driven remote state access within internal models and precaching during human expert route planning in very large structured spaces. Significance statement Humans can plan efficiently in incredibly complex situations. Existing work has looked at naive participants in simple tasks, which might not be representative of how experts plan in the real world. Here, we study the real-world planning process of London taxi drivers \u2013 famous for their expert knowledge of London. By analyzing their response times as a proxy for thinking times, we reveal that at an early stage in their thought process, they store decisions at key street junctions to keep them in mind for later planning.

One important aspect of sexuality concerns individuals' sex drive-their dispositional sexual motivation. A vigorous scientific (and popular) debate revolves around the question of whether or not there is a gender difference in sex drive. Several theories predict a higher sex drive in men compared to women, with some theories attributing this difference to biased responding rather than true differences. Currently, there is little consensus on how to conceptualize sex drive, nor does a quantitative summary of the literature exist. In this article, we present a theory-driven conceptualization of sex drive as the density distribution of state sex drive, where state sex drive is defined as momentary sexual motivation that manifests in sexual cognition, affect, and behavior. We conduct a comprehensive meta-analysis of gender differences in sex drive based on 211 studies, 856 effect sizes, and 621,463 persons. The meta-analysis revealed a stronger sex drive in men compared to women, with a medium-to-large effect size, g = 0.69, 95% CI [0.58, 0.81]. Men more often think and fantasize about sex, more often experience sexual affect like desire, and more often engage in masturbation than women. Adjustment for biased responding reduced the gender difference (g = 0.54). Moderation analyses suggest that the effect is robust and largely invariant to contextual factors.

People often react in a fairly discriminatory way to those with mental illness, and stigmatizing views toward those with mental illness are ubiquitous. In India, people who suffer from mental illness live with their families, and the stigma associated with mental illness has a significant impact on how effectively these people are treated over time by their families and communities. Objective: This study aims to specifically investigate how undergraduate medical students who participated in a two-week psychiatric posting and teaching program and those who did not learn about mental illness from the course curriculum or clinical experience differed in their perceived stigma toward people with mental illness. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study used a self-reported Perceived devaluation-discrimination scale (PDDS) questionnaire distributed via Google form to undergraduate medical students who were exposed (n = 72) to a two-week psychiatry posting and attended lectures and those who were not exposed (n = 176) to psychiatry training. Results: The results show that medical students\u2019 perceptions of the stigma associated with mental illness remain unchanged following their exposure to psychiatry training. Nonetheless, it was discovered that students\u2019 perceptions of the stigma associated with mental health patients were influenced by their urban domicile.

This study evaluated how different cognitive appraisals of an individual\u2019s sources of worry could influence their perceived self-efficacy and directly or indirectly moderate their perceived general distress. A sample of 544 participants completed a survey that included questions based on the generalized self-efficacy scale, the sources of concern during the epidemic, the cognitive appraisal scale in emergency, and perceived discomfort.

Method This is an exploratory study with a longitudinal design carried out with elite soccer athletes from two Brazilian soccer clubs. Data collection took place in person pre-pandemic (training) and online (during lockdown) between February and May 2020. The instruments used to assess sleep, daytime sleepiness, and anxiety were the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Epworth Daytime Sleepiness Scale-(ESS-BR), and Competitive Anxiety Scale (SCAT). For data analysis, descriptive statistics (frequencies, percentages, maximum and minimum) and non-parametric inferential statistics were used, establishing a significance of p\u2009<\u20090.05. Results In total, 76 male soccer athletes participated in the study. A significant increase was observed in anxiety levels in confinement compared to pre-pandemic training (p\u2009=\u20090.017; g\u2009=\u20090.83), and sleepiness significantly reduced in training compared to baseline levels (p\u2009=\u20090.007; g\u2009=\u20090.48). The athletes demonstrated good sleep quality and the pandemic did not significantly alter daytime sleepiness compared to training and baseline.

According to this view, which Alan Newell once characterized as \u201cplaying twenty questions with nature,\u201d theory is advanced one experiment at a time, and the integration of disparate findings is assumed to happen via the scientific publishing process. In this article, we argue that the process of integration is at best inefficient, and at worst it does not, in fact, occur. We further show that the challenge of integration cannot be adequately addressed by recently proposed reforms that focus on the reliability and replicability of individual findings, nor simply by conducting more or larger experiments. Rather, the problem arises from the imprecise nature of social and behavioral theories and, consequently, a lack of commensurability across experiments conducted under different conditions. Therefore, researchers must fundamentally rethink how they design experiments and how the experiments relate to theory. We specifically describe an alternative framework, integrative experiment design, which intrinsically promotes commensurability and continuous integration of knowledge. In this paradigm, researchers explicitly map the design space of possible experiments associated with a given research question, embracing many potentially relevant theories rather than focusing on just one. Researchers then iteratively generate theories and test them with experiments explicitly sampled from the design space, allowing results to be integrated across experiments. Given recent methodological and technological developments, we conclude that this approach is feasible and would generate more-reliable, more-cumulative empirical and theoretical knowledge than the current paradigm \u2013 and with far greater efficiency.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-12-21", "synthetic_support_claim": "Researchers must fundamentally rethink experiment design to promote integration and commensurability in social and behavioral sciences.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Theory generalizes effectively across different social and behavioral experiments without the need for integration."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "5880b2ea8c33e0b5255cdeffb6dd79d39ae62a9e", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5880b2ea8c33e0b5255cdeffb6dd79d39ae62a9e", "title": "Costly exploration produces stereotypes with dimensions of warmth and competence.", "abstract": "Traditional explanations for stereotypes assume that they result from deficits in humans (ingroup-favoring motives, cognitive biases) or their environments (majority advantages, real group differences). An alternative explanation recently proposed that stereotypes can emerge when exploration is costly. Even optimal decision makers in an ideal environment can inadvertently form incorrect impressions from arbitrary encounters. However, all these existing theories essentially describe shortcuts that fail to explain the multidimensionality of stereotypes. Stereotypes of social groups have a canonical multidimensional structure, organized along dimensions of warmth and competence. We show that these dimensions and the associated stereotypes can result from feature-based exploration: When individuals make self-interested decisions based on past experiences in an environment where exploring new options carries an implicit cost and when these options share similar attributes, they are more likely to separate groups along multiple dimensions. We formalize this theory via the contextual multiarmed bandit problem, use the resulting model to generate testable predictions, and evaluate those predictions against human behavior. We evaluate this process in incentivized decisions involving as many as 20 real jobs and successfully recover the classic dimensions of warmth and competence. Further experiments show that intervening on the cost of exploration effectively mitigates bias, further demonstrating that exploration cost per se is the operating variable.

Mean participant liking was 6.2 for the meat breakfast, 5.7 for the vegetarian breakfast, 5.8 for the chocolate pudding, and 4.3 for the vanilla dessert (along a 9-point scale). Meal liking was mediated by flavor intensity, sweetness intensity, and texture preference. Texture preference results indicated that older adults both like and are comfortable with orally handling textures typically deemed concerning for this population. Liking of the meals also increased if a higher experience of comfort was elicited during meal consumption (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05); perceived comfort decreased if there was insufficient flavor. Increased nostalgia experienced during meal consumption also increased overall liking. This study provided guidance on acceptable textures for potential product development while highlighting the importance of understanding the perception of nostalgia and comfort for older adults' meal acceptance.

However, most of the existing GNN explainers are either post-hoc in which another interpretive model needs to be created to explain a well-trained GNN, or do not consider the causal relationship between the extracted explanation and the decision, such that the explanation itself contains spurious correlations and suffers from weak faithfulness. In this work, we propose a granger causality-inspired graph neural network (CI-GNN), a built-in interpretable model that is able to identify the most influential subgraph (i.e., functional connectivity within brain regions) that is causally related to the decision (e.g., major depressive disorder patients or healthy controls), without the training of an auxillary interpretive network. CI-GNN learns disentangled subgraph-level representations \u03b1 and \u03b2 that encode, respectively, the causal and non-causal aspects of original graph under a graph variational autoencoder framework, regularized by a conditional mutual information (CMI) constraint. We theoretically justify the validity of the CMI regulation in capturing the causal relationship. We also empirically evaluate the performance of CI-GNN against three baseline GNNs and four state-of-the-art GNN explainers on synthetic data and three large-scale brain disease datasets. We observe that CI-GNN achieves the best performance in a wide range of metrics and provides more reliable and concise explanations which have clinical evidence.

Early diagnosis is crucial but challenging due to overlapping symptoms among impairment stages, necessitating non-invasive, reliable diagnostic tools. Methods: We applied information geometry and manifold learning to analyze grayscale MRI scans classified into No Impairment, Very Mild, Mild, and Moderate Impairment. Preprocessed images were reduced via Principal Component Analysis (retaining 95% variance) and converted into statistical manifolds using estimated mean vectors and covariance matrices. Geodesic distances, computed with the Fisher Information metric, quantified class differences. Graph Neural Networks, including Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT), and GraphSAGE, were utilized to categorize impairment levels using graph-based representations of the MRI data. Results: Significant differences in covariance structures were observed, with increased variability and stronger feature correlations at higher impairment levels. Geodesic distances between No Impairment and Mild Impairment (58.68, p<0.001) and between Mild and Moderate Impairment (58.28, p<0.001) are statistically significant. GCN and GraphSAGE achieve perfect classification accuracy (precision, recall, F1-Score: 1.0), correctly identifying all instances across classes. GAT attains an overall accuracy of 59.61%, with variable performance across classes.

Methods This study employed a cross-sectional survey methodology, with a sample of 900 Chinese university students as the research participants. A total of 844 valid questionnaires were collected and analyzed. The participants completed various scales, including measures of sports activity level, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, and achievement motivation. Subsequently, comprehensive descriptive statistical analyses were conducted on the gathered data. Results and conclusion A significant positive correlation is present between physical exercise and achievement motivation (r\u202f=\u202f0.464, p\u202f<\u202f0.01), self-efficacy (r\u202f=\u202f0.288, p\u202f<\u202f0.01), and life satisfaction (r\u202f=\u202f0.333, p\u202f<\u202f0.01) among college students. Moreover, achievement motivation demonstrates a positive association with self-efficacy (r\u202f=\u202f0.506, p\u202f<\u202f0.01) and life satisfaction (r\u202f=\u202f0.399, p\u202f<\u202f0.01). Furthermore, the relationship between physical exercise and achievement motivation can be influenced by both self-efficacy and life satisfaction as mediators in our constructed mediation model where the total effect is 0.512 with direct effect of 0.348 and indirect effect of 0.163. The results of the constructed mediating effect model demonstrate that self-efficacy and life satisfaction serve as significant mediators and moderators, effectively enhancing the achievement motivation levels of college students.

However, memories of events and experiences rely on cognitive heuristics that influence our recall. The peak-end bias, which refers to the tendency for the most intense and proximate aspects of an experience to disproportionately influence our memory, has been understudied in the context of mental health symptoms and may unduly influence self-reported symptoms, even in the context of standardized assessments. To determine whether the peak-end bias applies to the report of depressive symptoms on the standardized Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) assessment, we compared two scores from daily mood assessments collected over a 2-week period from 4,322 medical interns (56% women; 60% non-Hispanic White). The peak-end-mood score, which averaged the single lowest and most recent mood scores over 2 weeks had a significantly stronger correlation with the PHQ-9 than the mean-mood score, which averaged all mood scores during the 2 weeks. Likelihood ratio tests and fit statistics provided further support that the peak-end-mood score was a significantly better predictor of depression than the mean-mood score. Results were consistent when limiting the sample to those with mild-to-severe depressive symptoms, and when only examining the two primary mood items as the dependent variable. These findings provide evidence for a modest peak-end recall bias for mood and depressive symptoms.

Teens have turned to online peer support platforms to disclose and seek support about these experiences. Therefore, we analyzed posts (N=45,955) made by adolescents (ages 13--17) on an online peer support platform to deeply examine their online sexual risk experiences. By applying a mixed methods approach, we 1) accurately (average of AUC = 0.90) identified posts that contained teen disclosures about online sexual risk experiences and classified the posts based on level of consent (i.e., consensual, non-consensual, sexual abuse) and relationship type (i.e., stranger, dating/friend, family) between the teen and the person in which they shared the sexual experience, 2) detected statistically significant differences in the proportions of posts based on these dimensions, and 3) further unpacked the nuance in how these online sexual risk experiences were typically characterized in the posts. Teens were significantly more likely to engage in consensual sexting with friends/dating partners; unwanted solicitations were more likely from strangers and sexual abuse was more likely when a family member was involved. We contribute to the HCI and CSCW literature around youth online sexual risk experiences by moving beyond the false dichotomy of \"safe\" versus \"risky\".

Therefore, we conducted a thematic analysis on 2,061 posts made by 1,038 adolescents aged 15-17 on an online peer-support platform to investigate the ways in which these teens discussed popular social media platforms in their posts and to identify differences in their experiences across platforms. Our findings revealed four main emergent themes for the ways in which social media was discussed: 1) Sharing negative experiences or outcomes of social media use (58%, n = 1,095), 2) Attempts to connect with others (45%, n = 922), 3) Highlighting the positive side of social media use (20%, n = 409), and 4) Seeking information (20%, n = 491). Overall, while sharing about negative experiences was more prominent, teens also discussed balanced perspectives of connection-seeking, positive experiences, and information support on social media that should not be discounted. Moreover, we found statistical significance for how these experiences differed across social media platforms. For instance, teens were most likely to seek romantic relationships on Snapchat and self-promote on YouTube. Meanwhile, Instagram was mentioned most frequently for body shaming, and Facebook was the most commonly discussed platform for privacy violations (mostly from parents). The key takeaway from our study is that the benefits and drawbacks of teens' social media usage can co-exist and net effects (positive or negative) can vary across different teens across various contexts. As such, we advocate for mitigating the negative experiences and outcomes of social media use as voiced by teens, to improve, rather than limit or restrict, their overall social media experience.

We conducted experimental evaluations on a diverse set of ImageNet-1k classification models to explore this, keeping the architecture and training data constant but varying the training pipeline. Our findings reveal that the training method strongly influences which layers become critical to the decision function for a given task. For example, improved training regimes and self-supervised training increase the importance of early layers while significantly under-utilizing deeper layers.

In this work, we propose a novel method called diffusion model-assisted representation learning with a correlation-aware conditioning scheme (DCAC) to enhance DG Re-ID. Our method integrates a discriminative and contrastive Re-ID model with a pre-trained diffusion model through a correlation-aware conditioning scheme. By incorporating ID classification probabilities generated from the Re-ID model with a set of learnable ID-wise prompts, the conditioning scheme injects dark knowledge that captures ID correlations to guide the diffusion process. Simultaneously, feedback from the diffusion model is back-propagated through the conditioning scheme to the Re-ID model, effectively improving the generalization capability of Re-ID features.

To address these challenges, first, we conducted a literature review and identified three research lines that examined both emotion and data visualization. We clarified the differences between these research lines and kept 109 papers that studied or discussed how data visualization communicates and influences emotion.

There are continuous discussions about applying Hero's Journey to data stories. However, so far, little systematic and practical guidance on how to create a data video for a specific story type like the Hero's Journey, as well as how to manipulate its sound and visual designs simultaneously. To fulfill this gap, we first identified 48 data videos aligned with the Hero's Journey as the common storytelling from 109 high-quality data videos. Then, we examined how existing practices apply Hero's Journey for creating data videos. We coded the 48 data videos in terms of the narrative stages, sound design, and visual design according to the Hero's Journey structure. Based on our findings, we proposed a design space to provide practical guidance on the narrative, visual, and sound custom design for different narrative segments of the hero's journey (i.e., Departure, Initiation, Return) through data video creation. To validate our proposed design space, we conducted a user study where 20 participants were invited to design data videos with and without our design space guidance, which was evaluated by two experts.

As researchers and educators seek to imagine, design and support more humanistic accounts of young people's data practices, attuning to emotion will be a key area for further study. Recent scholarship in science education has elevated emotion as inseparable from disciplinary knowledge\u2010building practices, yet studies of emotion emergent within young people's data practices remain less understood.

I show how these emergent emotional configurations shift activity from collaborative to competitive, in turn changing attention to the data itself (properties, histories, visualizations), the underlying organisms being studied and the ecological system\u2010level interactions.

An online survey was distributed in January 2023 based on the previously validated 5C scale for psychological determinants of vaccination. Previous vaccination behavior was assessed by inquiring about the history of getting the primary and booster COVID-19 vaccination, influenza vaccine uptake during COVID-19, and any history of influenza vaccine uptake. The study sample consisted of 495 respondents: nurses (n = 302, 61.0%) and physicians (n = 193, 39.0%). Four hundred and thirty respondents (86.9%) had heard of Mpox before the study, and formed the final sample considered for Mpox knowledge analysis. Deficiencies in Mpox knowledge were reflected in a mean knowledge score of 13.3 \u00b1 2.7 (out of 20.0 as the maximum score), with significantly lower knowledge among nurses and females. The intention to receive Mpox vaccination was reported by 28.9% of the participants (n = 143), while 33.3% were hesitant (n = 165), and 37.8% were resistant (n = 187). In multivariate analysis, Mpox vaccine acceptance was significantly associated with previous vaccination behavior, reflected in higher vaccine uptake and with higher 5C scores, while Mpox knowledge was not correlated with Mpox vaccination intention. The overall attitude towards compulsory vaccination was neutral, while a favorable attitude towards compulsory vaccination was associated with higher 5C scores and a history of previous vaccination uptake. The current study showed a low intention to get Mpox vaccination in a sample of nurses and physicians practicing in Jordan.

However, vaccine hesitancy/resistance can undermine the beneficial impact of RSV vaccination. The aim of this study was to assess the willingness of pregnant women in Jordan to receive RSV vaccination and its associated determinants. Methods Face\u2010to\u2010face interviews were conducted in obstetrics/gynecology clinics in the Central, Northern, and Southern regions of Jordan during January\u2013February 2024, using a convenience sampling approach. Attitude to RSV vaccination was assessed using the previously validated ABCDEF scale. Results A total of 404 pregnant women participated in the study with a mean age of 30.1\u2009\u00b1\u20096.2 years. A majority of the participants showed willingness to receive RSV vaccination (n\u2009=\u2009313, 77.5%), with hesitancy among 25 participants (6.2%), and resistance among 66 participants (16.3%). Variables that were significantly associated with a higher RSV vaccine acceptance in multivariate analysis were: age <\u200930 years (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 2.45, p\u2009=\u20090.010), undergraduates (aOR: 3.27, p\u2009=\u20090.026), being a healthcare worker (aOR: 4.50, p\u2009=\u20090.036), and the history of previous COVID\u201019/influenza vaccine uptake (aOR: 2.47, p\u2009=\u20090.045). Two out of the six ABCDEF constructs were significantly associated with RSV vaccine acceptance, namely the \u201cAdvice\u201d construct (aOR: 10.38, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and the \u201cFear\u201d construct (aOR: 21.49, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Conclusion This study highlighted the complex nature of attitude towards maternal RSV vaccination among pregnant women. The study showed the role of demographic variables, prior vaccination experience, trust in credible health institutions and vaccine safety, and the fear of RSV disease consequences in infants in shaping maternal attitude to RSV vaccination.

They include technologies based on artificial intelligence that assess user\u2019s sentiment and emotions for the purpose of responding in an empathetic way, or for treatment purposes, e.g. for analyzing the expressed emotions and suggesting interventions. Methods In this paper, we study the ethical dimensions of integrating these technologies in chatbots for depression intervention using the digital ethics canvas and the DTx Risk Assessment Canvas. Results As result, we identified some specific risks associated with the integration of sentiment and emotion analysis methods into these systems related to the difficulty to recognize correctly the expressed sentiment or emotion from statements of individuals with depressive symptoms and the appropriate system reaction including risk detection. Depending on the realization of the sentiment or emotion analysis, which might be dictionary-based or machine-learning based, additional risks occur from biased training data or misinterpretations. Discussion While technology decisions during system development can be made carefully depending on the use case, other ethical risks cannot be prevented on a technical level, but by carefully integrating such chatbots into the care process allowing for supervision by health professionals. We conclude that a careful reflection is needed when integrating sentiment and emotion analysis into chatbots for depression intervention.

Despite the high psychological burden, adolescents rarely decide to contact child and adolescent psychiatric services. To provide a low-barrier alternative, our long-term goal is to develop a chatbot for early identification of depressive symptoms. To test feasibility, we followed a two-step procedure, a) collection and linguistic analysis of psychiatric interviews with healthy adolescents and adolescents with depressive disorders and training of classifiers for detection of disorders from their answers in interviews, and b) generation of additional adolescent utterances via Chat GPT to improve the previously created model. Methods For step a), we collected standardized interviews with 53 adolescents, n = 40 with and n = 13 without depressive disorders. The transcribed interviews comprised 4,077 question-answer-pairs, with which we predicted the clinical rating (depressive/non-depressive) with use of a feedforward neural network that received BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) vectors of interviewer questions and patient answers as input. For step b), we used the answers of all 53 interviews to instruct Chat GPT to generate new similar utterances. Results In step a), the classifier based on BERT was able to discriminate answers by adolescents with and without depression with accuracies up to 97% and identified commonly used words and phrases. Evaluating the quality of utterances generated in step b), we found that prompt engineering for this task is difficult as Chat GPT performs poorly with long prompts and abstract descriptions of expectations on appropriate responses. The best approach was to cite original answers from the transcripts in order to optimally mimic the style of language used by patients and to find a practicable compromise between the length of prompts that Chat GPT can handle and the number of examples presented in order to minimize literal repetitions in Chat GPT\u2019s output. Conclusion The results indicate that identifying linguistic patterns in adolescents\u2019 transcribed verbal responses is promising and that Chat GPT can be leveraged to generate a large dataset of interviews.

Like many aspects of human life, employee PWB is influenced by multiple factors. One of the factors that may affect employee PWB is transformational leadership (TLS). Accordingly, we aim through this study to empirically (1) examine the direct effect of transformational leadership on employee PWB and (2) investigate the potential independent and serial mediation effects of employee engagement (EEG) and job satisfaction (JS) on the TLS-PWB relationship after the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.

We use these design features to reflect on these technologies' implications using the ethical speculation lens. We analyzed patent applications that developed emotion recognition technologies to be used in the workplace (N=86).

Technologies described in patent applications frequently violated existing guidelines for ethical automated emotion recognition technology. We demonstrate the utility of using patent applications for ethical speculation. In doing so, we suggest that 1) increasing the visibility of claimed emotional states has the potential to create additional emotional labor for workers (a burden that is disproportionately distributed to low-power and marginalized workers) and contribute to a larger pattern of blurring boundaries between expectations of the workplace and a worker's autonomy, and more broadly to the data colonialism regime; 2) Emotion recognition technology's failures can be invisible, may inappropriately influence high-stakes workplace decisions and can exacerbate inequity.

Although touted for increasing hiring fit and reducing bias, it is unclear how job-seekers perceive emotion AI-enabled asynchronous interviews. This gap is striking, given job-seekers' marginalized position in hiring and how job-seekers with marginalized identities may be particularly vulnerable to this technology's potential harms. Addressing this gap, we conducted exploratory interviews with 14 U.S.-based participants with direct, recent experience with emotion AI-enabled asynchronous interviews. While participants acknowledged the asynchronous, virtual modality's potential benefits to employers and job-seekers, they perceived harms to job-seekers associated with automatic emotion inferences that our analysis maps to distributive, procedural, and interactional injustices. We find that social identity can inform job-seekers' perceptions of emotion AI, extending prior work's understandings of the factors contributing to job-seekers' perceptions of AI (broadly) in hiring. Moreover, our results suggest that emotion AI use may reconfigure demands for emotional labor in hiring and that deploying this technology in its current state may unjustly risk harmful outcomes for job-seekers - or, at the very least, perceptions thereof, which shape behaviors and attitudes. Accordingly, we recommend against the present adoption of emotion AI in hiring, identifying opportunities for the design of future asynchronous hiring interview platforms to be meaningfully transparent, contestable, and privacy-preserving.

Nevertheless, it is unclear whether VR constitutes an actual form of reality or is more like an advanced simulation. Determining the nature of VR has been mostly achieved by self-reported presence measurements, defined as the feeling of being submerged in the experience. However, subjective measurements might be prone to bias and, most importantly, do not allow for a comparison with real-life experiences. Here, we show that real-life and VR height exposures using 3D-360\u00b0 videos are mostly indistinguishable on a psychophysiological level (EEG and HRV), while both differ from a conventional 2D laboratory setting. Using a fire truck, three groups of participants experienced a real-life (N = 25), a virtual (N = 24), or a 2D laboratory (N = 25) height exposure. Behavioral and psychophysiological results suggest that identical exogenous and endogenous cognitive as well as emotional mechanisms are deployed to process the real-life and virtual experience. Specifically, alpha- and theta-band oscillations in line with heart rate variability, indexing vigilance, and anxiety were barely indistinguishable between those two conditions, while they differed significantly from the laboratory setup. Sensory processing, as reflected by beta-band oscillations, exhibits a different pattern for all conditions, indicating further room for improving VR on a haptic level. In conclusion, the study shows that contemporary photorealistic VR setups are technologically capable of mimicking reality, thus paving the way for the investigation of real-world cognitive and emotional processes under controlled laboratory conditions.

Prior work has linked expressive suppression usage with increases in cardiovascular disease risk, suggesting that racialized differences in expressive suppression usage may be one mechanism by which racism \"gets under the skin\" and creates heath disparities.\n\n\nMETHOD\nTo examine racialized differences in expressive suppression and blood pressure (a measure of cardiovascular disease risk), we used self-report and facial electromyography (fEMG) data from two cohorts of Black and White Americans from the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) longitudinal study (MIDUS 2, n = 271, 34.7% Black, collected from 2004-2009; MIDUS Refresher 1, n = 114, 31.6% Black, collected from 2012-2016; total N = 385, 33.9% Black).\n\n\nRESULTS\nBlack Americans reported engaging in expressive suppression more frequently than White Americans (t(260.95) = 2.18, p = .002) and showed less corrugator fEMG activity during negative images(t(969) = 2.38, pFDR = .026).

Active stressors are commonly used to investigate cardiovascular and immune reactivity; however, this response may not translate to other stress modalities. We aimed to decipher potential differences in immune responses to passive and active stressors. Methods Eighty-eight participants completed this study. After a baseline period, a passive (International Affective Picture System [IAPS]) and active stress task (Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test [PASAT]) were completed in a randomized order, with 45-minute rest post-tasks. Cardiovascular measures (including SBP, DBP, HR) were collected continuously. Blood samples were collected after each time point determining inflammatory responses, including circulating and stimulated interleukin-6 (IL-6), systemic inflammation response index (SIRI), neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), TNF-\u03b1, and P- and E-selectin. Results Cardiovascular measures were higher during the PASAT than IAPS (p < .001). Circulating IL-6 levels increased from baseline to 45-minutes after both tasks (p \u2264 .001), with no difference between 45-minute post-PASAT and 45-minute post-IAPS (p > .05).

The average time of exercise reported by the students was 277\u2009min per week. Physical activity appears to be positively correlated with improved mood states, particularly in adolescents who engage in 150\u2009min or more of physical activity per week, who exhibited notably higher levels of vigor. It was found that female adolescents presented a worse mood state, greater tension, depression, anger, fatigue, and mental confusion, and worse vigor when compared to boys and that adolescents who had poor sleep quality presented significantly worse mood state.

The MIDS was a stronger predictor of functioning than PMIE exposure measures, explaining seven times greater unique variance (9% vs. 1%-1.3%).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe MIDS is the first scale to assess moral injury symptoms indexed to a specific PMIE that is validated across several high-risk populations.

Recognized for its potency in shaping the relationships that facilitate business undertakings and access to key resources, Guanxi is postulated as a potential mediator in the nexus between organizational justice and contextual work performance. The depth of Guanxi, intertwined with Chinese culture and values, may be perceived differently across age groups. Specifically, as Chinese millennials usually interact with global paradigms, generational disparities might emerge in valuing these traditional constructs. This study delves into how the dimensions of Guanxi\u2014Ganqing (emotional connection), Renqing (reciprocity), and Xinren (loyalty)\u2014mediate the relationship between organizational justice and contextual work performance, with chronological age as a moderator. The present study includes a convenience sample of 630 Chinese employees, aged 22\u201367\u2009years, who participated in a quantitative online survey. The findings endorse the mediation role of Guanxi. The total influence of justice was found to be significant, as well as the indirect impacts, that were statistically salient. Although the age\u2010moderated mediation was not wholly substantiated, the age\u2010specific indirect effects of Renqing and Xinren did present significant variances between millennials and those above 42\u2009years. The relevance of this study extends beyond the academic field, shedding light on the cultural dynamics at play within Chinese organizational settings. By unveiling the relationships between Guanxi, organizational justice, and performance, and by elucidating the age\u2010specific variations therein, this research provides insights for organizational leaders and human resource professionals. Based on these findings, businesses can craft targeted interventions that capitalize on the strengths of Guanxi, ensuring fair practices and enhancing performance across diverse age groups.

We included studies that reported neuroimaging features of AD patients with delusion, hallucination, or psychosis. Results After the screening, 34 studies with 2241 AD patients were eligible to be included in our qualitative synthesis.

The present studies investigated whether learning multiple real-world skills simultaneously is possible in older adults and also whether it improves both their cognitive abilities (working memory, episodic memory, and cognitive control) and functional independence. Methods Over two studies (15 and 27 participants), older adults learned at least three new skills (e.g., Spanish, drawing, music composition) simultaneously for 3 months. Participants completed cognitive and functional assessments before, during, and after the intervention in both studies. Participants were recruited sequentially for an intervention or no-contact control group in Study 1, and Study 2 included only an intervention group, who also completed assessments 4\u20136 weeks prior to the start of the intervention (i.e., they served as their own control group). Results Results from both studies show that simultaneously learning multiple skills is feasible and potentially beneficial for healthy older adults. Learning multiple skills simultaneously increased cognitive abilities in older adults by midpoint of the intervention, to levels similar to performance in a separate sample of middle-aged adults.

Dietary factors that increase the risk of the illness include energy overload, skipping breakfast, unhealthy diet styles such as Western diet, inflammation\u2010prone diet, and high consumption of ultraprocessed food (UPF). Nutritional imbalances such as inadequate intake of protein, fish (\u03a93 polyunsaturated fatty acids), vitamins (folate and vitamin D), and minerals (iron and zinc) increases the risk of depression. Poor oral hygiene, food allergy, addiction to alcohol, and smoking constitute risk factors.

Here, a molecularly defined tri\u2010synaptic pathway circuit is identified that correlates motor inputs with antidepressant effects. With this pathway, initial inputs from neurons within the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) project to excitatory neurons in the gracile nucleus (GR), which in turn connect with 5\u2010HTergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), eventually coursing to excitatory pyramidal neurons within the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Exercise activates this pathway, with the result that depressive\u2010 and anxiety\u2010like behaviors in mice are significantly reduced. In addition, it is found that exercise may exert antidepressant effects through regulating synaptic plasticity within this tri\u2010synaptic pathway.

Similarly, limited research has examined the joint effects of adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) and chronotype on depressive symptoms, accounting for sex differences. Therefore, these are the objectives of our investigation in a Mediterranean population at high cardiovascular risk. Methods: We analyzed 465 older subjects (aged 55\u201375) with metabolic syndrome and assessed depressive symptoms by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II). MedDiet adherence was measured with the 17-item MedDiet score, and chronotype with the Morningness\u2013Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ). Blood DNA methylation was analyzed, and epigenomic biomarkers of age acceleration were determined. We focused on the Dunedin Pace of Aging Computed from the Epigenome (DunedinPACE). We fitted multivariable models with interaction terms. Results: Prevalence of depression was statistically higher in women (p < 0.001). MedDiet adherence was strongly and inversely associated with depressive symptoms in the whole population (p < 0.01), while the MEQ score was inversely associated (p < 0.05). In the joint analysis, both MedDiet adherence and chronotype remained statistically associated with the BDI-II score (p < 0.05), showing additive effects. No interaction effects were observed. In women, a higher score in depressive symptoms was significantly associated with faster age acceleration (measured with the DunedinPACE biomarker). This association remained significant even after adjustment for MedDiet adherence and chronotype. Conclusions: In older subjects with metabolic syndrome, the eveningness chronotype was associated with greater depressive symptoms, but a higher adherence to the MedDiet could potentially counteract the chronotype risk with additive effects.

Heavy drinking, which is also common, contributes to multiple adverse medical, psychiatric, and social outcomes and more than 140,000 deaths annually in the United States. It is the major risk factor for alcohol use disorder (AUD), whose current U.S. prevalence is 11%. However, AUD is undertreated, with less than 15% of individuals with a lifetime diagnosis receiving any treatment. Risk of AUD is nearly equally genetic and environmental. AUD is responsive to psychosocial treatments, including cognitive-behavioral therapy and motivational enhancement therapy. Alcohol affects multiple neurotransmitter systems, and thus pharmacotherapy for AUD is also effective. The three medications approved in the United States to treat AUD-disulfiram, naltrexone (oral and long-acting injectable formulations), and acamprosate-are underprescribed, despite being considered first-line treatments in clinical practice guidelines. Two medications not approved for treating AUD, topiramate and gabapentin, have shown efficacy in treating the disorder and are used off-label. Recent studies of novel drug candidates, including psychedelics and phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors, are promising additions for the treatment of AUD, although they require further evaluation before being used clinically.

Methods Data were analyzed from the NHANES surveys conducted between 1999 and 2016, including 26,473 participants. Drinking patterns were categorized by frequency (weekly, monthly, or yearly) and quantity (light, moderate, or heavy, based on daily consumption). Among participants with diabetes, DKD was defined using the albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR \u226530\u2009mg/g) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR <60\u2009mL/min/1.73 m2). Multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate associations, adjusting for potential confounders across the four models. Subgroup analyses were performed to assess the effects of modification by age, sex, race, BMI. Results Drinking patterns and DKD were analyzed among 26,473\u2009US adults (mean age, 46.6\u2009years; 53.7% male). After adjusting for multiple confounders, heavy alcohol consumption was associated with a higher risk of DKD than light drinking (OR = 1.23, 95% CI, 1.04\u20131.46; p\u2009=\u20090.016). Conversely, moderate drinking frequency (3\u20134\u2009days per week, 2\u20135\u2009days per month, 3\u2013126\u2009days per year) was associated with a reduced DKD risk (OR = 0.67, 95% CI, 0.49\u20130.91; OR = 0.75, 95% CI, 0.56\u20130.99, OR = 0.71, 95% CI, 0.58\u20130.86, respectively). A nonlinear association was observed between alcohol consumption frequency and DKD in terms of weekly and yearly drinking days. Conclusion This study highlights the importance of drinking behavior in the management of diabetic kidney disease.

An autonomic cycle of data analysis tasks is a set of data analysis tasks that supervise and control a process anonymously, which are based on knowledge models (of prediction, recognition, etc.), interacting with each other to reach a common goal. Each task has a different function in the cycle: observation of the process, or its analysis, or decision-making.FindingsThis work presents the autonomic cycle. With its components, this autonomic cycle detects sound information using a taxonomic model of the sound events to analyze them and give a recommendation about the context. The taxonomic model is a hierarchical pattern that considers different aspects to recognize the sound events. This work defines the architecture of this autonomic cycle, specifies its machine-learning-based analysis tasks and evaluates its capabilities of reasoning, adaptation and communication in case studies.Research limitations/implicationsIt is important to work in the future on the improvement of the accuracy of the system by implementing neural networks or more sophisticated techniques. To take the implemented autonomic cycle to a higher level, it could use parallel function management. The automation also needs improvement.

These mediating relationships enhance social media\u2019s effects on expatriate performance and adjustment.Originality/valueThis study paves the way for future empirical works regarding the implementation of novel tools in the pursuit of expatriate excellence.

This has also brought the issue of Internet addiction, including the overuse and negative effects of short videos, to the forefront of attention. Past research has found that Internet addiction has a negative impact on well-being. However, there is a special concept of positive emotion called \u201cserendipity\u201d (\u5c0f\u786e\u5e78). Serendipity provides a small, fleeting but positive experience, yet it is often associated with negative perceptions from an outside perspective. However, the relationship between short video addiction and serendipity is not yet known. Based on this, a theoretical model was developed in the context of the I-PACE model. To understand the relationship between short video addiction and serendipity among college students, in this study, we conducted snowball sampling and distributed online questionnaires using the Wenjuanxing platform. The target population of the questionnaire distribution was vocational college students in China, of whom 985 valid study participants responded, yielding a valid return rate of 82.1%. Of the respondents, 410 (41.6%) were male and 575 (58.4%) were female. The results were as follows: a. short video flow had a positive relationship with serendipity, a negative relationship with achievement motivation, and a positive effect on short video addiction; b. short video addiction had a positive effect on serendipity and a negative effect on achievement motivation; and c. serendipity had a negative impact on achievement motivation.

While they remain highly prescribed, their unfavorable side-effect profile and abuse liability motivated a search for alternatives. Most of these efforts focused on the development of benzodiazepine-like drugs that are selective for specific GABAA receptor subtypes. While there is ample evidence that subtype-selective GABAA receptor ligands have great potential for providing symptom relief without typical benzodiazepine side-effects, it is less clear whether subtype-selective targeting strategies can also reduce misuse and abuse potential. This review focuses on the three benzodiazepine properties that are relevant to the DSM-5-TR criteria for Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Use Disorder, namely, reinforcing properties of benzodiazepines, maladaptive behaviors related to benzodiazepine use, and benzodiazepine tolerance and dependence. We review existing evidence regarding the involvement of different GABAA receptor subtypes in each of these areas. The reviewed studies suggest that \u03b11-containing GABAA receptors play an integral role in benzodiazepine-induced plasticity in reward-related brain areas and might be involved in the development of tolerance and dependence to benzodiazepines. However, a systematic comparison of the contributions of all benzodiazepine-sensitive GABAA receptors to these processes, a mechanistic understanding of how the positive modulation of each receptor subtype might contribute to the brain mechanisms underlying each of these processes, and a definitive answer to the question of whether specific chronic modulation of any given subtype would result in some or all of the benzodiazepine effects are currently lacking from the literature. Moreover, how non-selective benzodiazepines might lead to the maladaptive behaviors listed in DSM and how different GABAA receptor subtypes might be involved in the development of these behaviors remains unexplored. Considering the increasing burden of benzodiazepine abuse, the common practice of benzodiazepine misuse that leads to severe dependence, and the current efforts to generate side-effect free benzodiazepine alternatives, there is an urgent need for systematic, mechanistic research that provides a better understanding of the brain mechanisms of benzodiazepine misuse and abuse, including the involvement of specific GABAA receptor subtypes in these processes, to establish an informed foundation for preclinical and clinical efforts.", "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-01-12", "synthetic_support_claim": "\u03b11-containing GABAA receptors play an integral role in benzodiazepine-induced plasticity in reward-related brain areas.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Subtype-selective GABAA receptor targeting completely eliminates the abuse potential of benzodiazepines."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "62364bda1ad7b5328df3a923044b236efa8f9c26", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/62364bda1ad7b5328df3a923044b236efa8f9c26", "title": "Evidence of Oxidative Stress as a Mechanism of Pharmaceutical-Induced Toxicity in Amphibians", "abstract": "Amphibians, which are essential components of ecosystems, are susceptible to pharmaceutical contamination, a phenomenon of increasing concern owing to the widespread consumption and detection of pharmaceutical compounds in environmental matrices.

While fear and stress were crucial for the survival of our ancestors, today, they are mostly considered harmful factors, threatening both our physical and mental health. Trauma is a highly stressful, often life-threatening event or a series of events, such as sexual assault, war, natural disasters, burns, and car accidents. Trauma can cause pathological metaplasticity, leading to long-lasting behavioral changes and impairing an individual\u2019s ability to cope with future challenges. If an individual is vulnerable, a tremendously traumatic event may result in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The hypothalamus is critical in initiating hormonal responses to stressful stimuli via the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal (HPA) axis. Linked to the prefrontal cortex and limbic structures, especially the amygdala and hippocampus, the hypothalamus acts as a central hub, integrating physiological aspects of the stress response. Consequently, the hypothalamic functions have been attributed to the pathophysiology of PTSD. However, apart from the well-known role of the HPA axis, the hypothalamus may also play different roles in the development of PTSD through other pathways, including the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013thyroid (HPT) and hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013gonadal (HPG) axes, as well as by secreting growth hormone, prolactin, dopamine, and oxytocin.

Vitamins C and gallic acid (GA) possess potent antioxidant properties, making them potential candidates for addressing autism\u2010related issues. This study examined the influence of vitamin C (Vit C) and GA on behavioral, motor, and cognitive performance, along with the assessment of brain oxidative markers, using an experimental model of autism. Method Fourteen female rats were divided into saline and valproic acid (VPA) groups, and mating with mature male rats generated offspring. VPA (500 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) on gestational day (GD) 12.5. Male pups remained undisturbed for 29 days. On postnatal day (PND) 30, 48 male pups were randomly selected and administered daily injections of Vit C (30 mg/kg, i.p.) or GA (30 mg/kg, i.p.) for 4 weeks (PND 38\u201365). Behavioral assessments were conducted before and after treatment (PND 30\u201337 and 66\u201373). Animals were then anesthetized, and their brains were analyzed for oxidative stress markers. Finding The prenatal VPA\u2010induced autism model increased nociceptive threshold, heightened anxiety\u2010like behaviors, impaired balance power, delayed spatial learning, elevated malondialdehyde, and decreased glutathione and catalase levels in the brains of the male offspring. Administration of Vit C and GA effectively mitigated these anomalies. Conclusions Vit C and GA could potentially alleviate anxiety\u2010like behaviors, motor and cognitive deficits, and brain oxidative stress markers in a prenatal rat autism model. This underscores their viability as potential pharmacological interventions for treating autistic dysfunction.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-01", "synthetic_support_claim": "Vitamin C and gallic acid can alleviate cognitive and motor deficits in a prenatal rat autism model.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Vitamin C and gallic acid can cure autism in humans."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "0ed00dbaf7d7edef39bd66a5b95f91896e86c46e", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0ed00dbaf7d7edef39bd66a5b95f91896e86c46e", "title": "Challenging stereotypes of teens: Reframing adolescence as window of opportunity.", "abstract": "In this review, we seek to challenge negative stereotypes of adolescence and unpack the many ways that the developing brain contributes to positive development during the adolescent years.

In adolescents, developmental changes in specific choice behaviors have been observed (e.g., goal-directed behavior, motivational influences over choice). Elevated levels of decision noise, i.e., choosing suboptimal options, were reported consistently in adolescents. However, it remains unknown whether these observations, the development of specific and more sophisticated choice processes and higher decision noise, are independent or related. It is conceivable, but has not yet been investigated, that the development of specific choice processes might be impacted by age-dependent changes in decision noise. To answer this, we examined 93 participants (12 to 42 years) who completed 3 reinforcement learning (RL) tasks: a motivational Go/NoGo task assessing motivational influences over choices, a reversal learning task capturing adaptive decision-making in response to environmental changes, and a sequential choice task measuring goal-directed behavior. This allowed testing of (1) cross-task generalization of computational parameters focusing on decision noise; and (2) assessment of mediation effects of noise on specific choice behaviors. Firstly, we found only noise levels to be strongly correlated across RL tasks. Second, and critically, noise levels mediated age-dependent increases in more sophisticated choice behaviors and performance gain. Our findings provide novel insights into the computational processes underlying developmental changes in decision-making: namely a vital role of seemingly unspecific changes in noise in the specific development of more complex choice components.

Objective: Two aims of this transnational study were (1) to compare psychological distress and coping strategies among people living in Ukraine, Poland, and Taiwan, (2) to examine whether the associations between various coping strategies (ie. problem-focused coping, emotion-focused coping, and avoidance) and psychological distress (ie. depression, anxiety, stress, posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, and hopelessness about the ongoing war) differed among people of various countries during the initial stage of the 2022 War in Ukraine. Method: In total, 1,598 participants (362 from Ukraine, 1,051 from Poland, and 185 from Taiwan) were recruited using an online advertisement to complete online survey questionnaires, including the Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced inventory; the 21-item Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale; the Impact of Event Scale-Revised; and a questionnaire devised to assess the level of hopelessness about the ongoing war. Results: Psychological distress and adoption of coping strategies differed across people of various countries. Among Taiwanese and Polish respondents, avoidant coping strategies were most strongly associated with all categories of psychological distress compared with problem- and emotion-focused coping strategies. However, the associations of various coping strategies with psychological distress differed to a less extent among Ukrainian respondents. In addition, problem- and emotion-focused coping strategies had comparable associations with psychological distress among the people of Ukraine, Poland, and Taiwan. Conclusions: The 2022 War in Ukraine has affected the psychological well-being of people, especially the Ukrainians. Because of the strong association between the adoption of avoidance coping strategies and psychological distress, despite a less extent among Ukrainian respondents, adaptive coping strategies such as (problem- and emotion-focused) are suggested to help people during times of war.

The analyzed articles were published before, during and after the 2021 Heat Dome, and were qualitatively coded and thematically analyzed in NVivo to identify patterns of meaning across the dataset. Results Four main themes were identified within our media-based analysis: (I) the reported impact of toxic drug use on human thermoregulation and behavioural adaptation; (II) the reported demand of intersecting crises on the health system; (III) barriers and stigma reported to influence an individual\u2019s access to or use of heat mitigation behaviours and services; and (IV) the reported impact of extreme heat on the public health response to drug poisoning emergencies.

This study assesses the association between stressful life events (SLEs) and depression, anxiety, and quality of life among adolescents and young adults from deprived neighbourhoods of Latin America. Methods The sample consisted of 2,402 participants, between adolescents (15\u201316\u2009years) and young adults (20\u201324\u2009years), from Bogot\u00e1 (Colombia), Buenos Aires (Argentina), and Lima (Peru), assessed in 2021\u20132022 and recruited in education and community settings and social media. We evaluated the most frequent recent and distant SLEs (occurred in the previous year and more than a year ago, respectively), the relationship between SLEs and severity of depression (PHQ-8), anxiety (GAD-7), and quality of life (MANSA), and we tested for differences by gender and age group. Results The most common recent and distant SLEs were related to public safety issues and financial distress. Accidents and school suspensions were more frequent among men, and sexual harassment and bullying among women. Every additional reported recent SLE increased the odds of mild, moderate, and severe depression (18, 17, and 25%, respectively) and anxiety (10, 17, and 21%, respectively) symptoms. Similar trends were found with distant SLEs and depression (8, 9, and 11% for mild, moderate, and severe symptoms, respectively) and anxiety (9, 11, and 12%, respectively). Furthermore, a higher number of recent and distant SLEs were associated with lower quality of life (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009\u22120.05, p\u2009<\u20090.001, 95% CI [\u22120.06, \u22120.04] and \u03b2\u2009=\u2009\u22120.04, p\u2009<\u20090.001, 95% CI [\u22120.05, \u22120.03], respectively).

Physiological ageing is accompanied with structural and functional decline of neuroglia. In particular, astrocytes undergo morphological atrophy and functional asthenia which compromises their vital functions such as glutamate clearance, K+ buffering and synaptic support. Old oligodendrocytes lose their myelination capacity, which results in the thinning of myelin sheath and atrophy of white matter. Finally, ageing is associated with accumulation of dystrophic microglia which limits neuroprotection. Age-dependent neuroglial decline impedes cognitive reserve, contributes to cognitive impairment, and increases vulnerability of the nervous system to neurodegeneration.

The sample consists of 2,001 employees working in companies registered in Portugal. It explores the impact of the change to remote work on job quality and job security. In addition, it explores the relevance of demographic, organizational and social factors to explain this relationship.\n\nFindings\nThe findings reveal that the change to remote work has influenced the perception of job quality but not job security. Furthermore, demographic, organizational and social variables are factors that influence this perception.\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nImplications that digitalization can have on job security and quality, especially among the population with lower levels of education and more precarious working conditions, should be explored. It is also important to replicate this study in other countries, especially in emerging economies.\n\nPractical implications\nBy investigating job security, the study offers insights into the stability and predictability of employment during crises and disruptive events. By examining job quality, it delves into the multifaceted nature of work satisfaction, including factors like work-life balance, autonomy and fulfilment. Practically, the study provides valuable guidance for policymakers, organizations and individuals navigating remote work environments.\n\nSocial implications\nUnderstanding the implications for job security allows policymakers to design supportive policies and interventions to mitigate potential negative impacts on employment stability.\n\nOriginality/value\nThis study uses a sufficiently comprehensive national sample to determine the impact of COVID-19 on employment. It offers both theoretical and practical contributions to increase knowledge about the phenomenon and provides a relevant guide for policymakers to adopt measures to mitigate the effects of the transition to remote work.\n", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-11-27", "synthetic_support_claim": "The change to remote work has influenced the perception of job quality but not job security.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Remote work improves job security for employees in all demographic groups and organizational settings in Portugal."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "7792d8a7ad8dd8fe2c63e7a7b19c47184e803ffe", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7792d8a7ad8dd8fe2c63e7a7b19c47184e803ffe", "title": "E-\u00c7al\u0131\u015fma \u00d6l\u00e7e\u011finin T\u00fcrk\u00e7eye Uyarlanmas\u0131: \u0130\u015f-Ya\u015fam Dengesi, Verimlilik, \u00d6rg\u00fctsel G\u00fcven ve Esneklik Ba\u011flam\u0131nda Yaz\u0131l\u0131m Sekt\u00f6r\u00fc \u00dczerine Bir \u0130nceleme", "abstract": "Ama\u00e7: Uzaktan \u00e7al\u0131\u015fma y\u00f6ntemlerinin yayg\u0131nla\u015fmas\u0131yla birlikte uzaktan \u00e7al\u0131\u015fman\u0131n sistemati\u011fini, bile\u015fenlerini, \u00e7al\u0131\u015fanlar ve i\u015fverenler \u00fczerindeki etkilerini, verimlili\u011fini, avantajlar\u0131n\u0131 ve dezavantajlar\u0131n\u0131 tespit edip \u00f6l\u00e7menin \u00f6nemi de artmaktad\u0131r.

We conducted a network meta-analysis (NMA) to assess the comparative impact of different physical exercise modalities on enhancing executive functions (EFs) and alleviating symptoms in children and adolescents with ADHD. Methods We searched Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, SPORTDiscus, PsycINFO, CNKI, and clinical trials databases from inception to October 20, 2022. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental studies investigating physical exercise for ADHD-related symptoms of hyperactivity/impulsivity and inattention, and executive functions were included. The frequentist random-effect NMA method was applied to pool the results. Results A total of 59 studies (including 39 RCTs, 5 quasi-RCTs, and 15 self-controlled trials) published between 1983 and 2022 were incorporated into the systematic review, of which 44 studies with 1757 participants were eligible for meta-analysis. All types of physical exercise were effective in improving EFs (SMD\u2009=\u20091.15, 95% CI: 0.83 to 1.46), and open-skill activities which require participants to react in a dynamically changing and externally paced environment induced the most incredible benefits for executive functions (SUCRA\u2009=\u200998.0%, SMD\u2009=\u20091.96, and 95% CI: 1.15 to 2.77). Subgroup analyses for EFs revealed varied findings that open-skill activities were the most promising physical exercise type for improving inhibitory control (SUCRA\u2009=\u200999.1%, SMD\u2009=\u20091.94, and 95% CI: 1.24 to 2.64), and closed-skill activities dominated by aerobic exercises had a slightly higher probability of being the most promising physical exercise intervention for working memory (SUCRA\u2009=\u200975.9%, SMD\u2009=\u20091.21, and 95% CI: \u22120.22 to 2.65), and multicomponent physical exercise tended to be the most effective in cognitive flexibility (SUCRA\u2009=\u200970.3%, SMD\u2009=\u20091.44, and 95% CI: \u22120.19 to 3.07). Regarding ADHD-related symptoms, closed-skill activities dominated by aerobic exercises might be more advantageous for hyperactivity/impulsivity (SUCRA\u2009=\u200972.5%, SMD\u2009=\u2009-1.60, and 95% CI: \u22123.02 to \u22120.19) and inattention (SUCRA\u2009=\u200996.3%, SMD\u2009=\u2009-1.51, and 95% CI: \u22122.33 to \u22120.69) improvement.

Addressing these visual issues is important for improving the overall quality of life and functional outcomes in individuals with ADHD, particularly in academic and social settings.\n\n\nPURPOSE\nTo investigate the relationship between vision-related quality of life and near-work visual symptoms in patients with ADHD patients.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA cohort of 37 individuals with ADHD was compared to age- and sex-matched healthy controls (n = 37). The 25-Item National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI VFQ-25) and the Convergence Insufficiency Symptoms Survey (CISS) were used to assess vision-related quality of life and near-work visual symptoms.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMean NEI VFQ-25 scores were not significantly different between the ADHD and control groups. However, individuals with ADHD scored lower on the near activities (p = 0.032; Cohen's d = -0.511), social functioning (p = 0.045; Cohen's d = -0.481) and driving (p = 0.007; Cohen's d = -0.124) subscales. The CISS scores were significantly higher in the ADHD group (23.43 \u00b1 11.22) than in the control group (14.02 \u00b1 9.36; p < 0.001; Cohen's d = 0.910), indicating a significant relationship between ADHD and the presence of symptomatic subjects (p < 0.001; Cramer's V = 0.541). Medication did not affect NEI VFQ-25 or CISS scores. Female gender was associated with an increased number of symptomatic subjects based on their CISS scores (p = 0.043; Cramer's V = 0.396).

Non-pharmacological interventions have demonstrated effectiveness both as standalone treatments and adjuncts to pharmacotherapy in managing adult ADHD. Nevertheless, the comparative efficacy of these interventions, particularly with respect to diverse ADHD-related outcomes and their long-term impacts, remains insufficiently investigated. Objective This study aims to evaluate and compare the short-term and long-term effects of various non-pharmacological therapies on core ADHD symptoms (inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity) and emotional disorders (depression and anxiety) in adults with ADHD and to rank these therapies accordingly. Methods A systematic search was conducted for relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the Web of Science, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE databases from inception to Sep 2024. Researchers independently screened and extracted data, and the analysis was performed using R version 4.3.2. Cochrane Risk of Bias tool version 2 (ROB2) and Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis (CINeMA) were used to assess the risk of bias and the certainty of the evidence. Standardized mean differences were estimated using network meta-analyses with random effects. Results A total of 37 RCTs involving 2,289 participants and 10 non-pharmacological therapies were included. The risk of bias was classified as low in 24.3%, unclear in 27%, and high in 48.6%, while the CINeMA assessment indicated that confidence in the evidence was \u201cvery low\u201d or \u201clow\u201d for most of the remaining treatments. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) showed significantly greater effectiveness than the control group/condition in both the short-term (SMD: -4.43, 95%CI: -5.50 to -3.37) and long-term (SMD: -3.61, 95%CI: -4.66 to -2.56) core symptoms. Additionally, CBT shows both short-term and long-term efficacy for depression (SMD: -4.16, 95%CI: -5.51 to -2.81; SMD: -3.89, 95%CI: -5.95 to -1.83) and anxiety (SMD: -2.12, 95%CI: -3.18 to -1.07; SMD: -7.25, 95%CI: -10.57 to -3.94). Conclusion CBT may be the most effective intervention for adults with ADHD and associated emotional disorders, while Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy (MC) is recommended as a preferable option for those without comorbidities.

While most patients recover after treatment, there is growing evidence that COVID-19 may result in cognitive impairment. Recent studies reveal that some individuals experience cognitive deficits, such as diminished memory and attention, as well as sleep disturbances, suggesting that COVID-19 could have long-term effects on cognitive function. Research indicates that COVID-19 may contribute to cognitive decline by damaging crucial brain regions, including the hippocampus and anterior cingulate cortex. Additionally, studies have identified active neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and microglial activation in COVID-19 patients, implying that these factors may be potential mechanisms leading to cognitive impairment. Given these findings, the possibility of cognitive impairment following COVID-19 treatment warrants careful consideration. Large-scale follow-up studies are needed to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on cognitive function and offer evidence to support clinical treatment and rehabilitation practices. In-depth neuropathological and biological studies can elucidate precise mechanisms and provide a theoretical basis for prevention, treatment, and intervention research. Considering the risks of the long-term effects of COVID-19 and the possibility of reinfection, it is imperative to integrate basic and clinical research data to optimize the preservation of patients' cognitive function and quality of life.

The influence of environmental and psychosocial factors on delirium during different phases of the pandemic remains underexplored. This study aimed to assess the differences in predisposing factors for delirium between the restriction and relaxed periods of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nMethods: In this retrospective study, 102 patients diagnosed with delirium between January 2020 and December 2023 were included. Patients were divided into two groups based on their admission periods relative to the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. Group 1 (n = 64) consisted of patients admitted during the period of strict COVID-19 measures (11 March 2020 \u2013 30 June 2021), while Group 2 (n = 38) included those admitted after the restrictions were lifted (1 July 2021 \u2013 30 June 2023). Demographic and clinical data were collected using the hospital's electronic information system and patient files.\nResults: The mean age of the patients was 72.4 \u00b1 11.5 years (range: 50 to 92 years), and 51% of them were male. There were no significant differences in the distribution of age, gender, and comorbidities across the two groups. Group 1 had a significantly higher ratio of patients with COVID-19 infection compared to Group 2 (60.9% vs. 36.8%, p = 0.024). Sleep deprivation was more common in Group 1 than in Group 2 (87.5% vs. 68.4%, p = 0.037). The duration of delirium was significantly longer in Group than in Group 2 (3 vs. 2 days p = 0.045). Patients in Group 1 had a significantly longer hospital stay compared to those in Group 2 (9 vs. 6 days p < 0.001). Although the mortality rate was observed to be higher in Group 1 compared to Group 2, this difference was not statistically significant (18.8% vs. 10.5%, p = 0.400).\nConclusion: During the restriction period of the COVID-19 pandemic, patients with delirium exhibited higher rates of COVID-19 infection, increased sleep deprivation, and longer delirium episodes compared to those during the relaxed period.

The long-term persistence and polymorphism of symptoms after COVID-19 is a growing concern. It is characterized by undulation, when some of the symptoms may temporarily disappear and then return again. As of 2024, the prevalence of long COVID is 6\u20137% in adults and about 1% in children. Using neuroimaging techniques is an integral part of the timely diagnosis of acute disorders and consequences associated with COVID-19.OBJECTIVE: To assess the nature of health complaints, features of neurological and cognitive disorders and compare them with radiological changes in the brain in people in the post-COVID period.MATERIALS AND METHODS: For the period from 2023\u20132024, 170 patients aged 18 to 60 years participated in the study, with a history of established fact of COVID-19, confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) SARS-CoV-2. The main socio-demographic and clinical and laboratory indicators were evaluated for all participants, with further radiological examination. As part of the neuropsychological examination, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MoCA), \u00ab10 words\u00bb by A.R. was evaluated. Luria, \u00abSchulte Tables\u00bb, neuropsychological tests to study the state of praxis and the state of various aspects of gnosis, as well as a subjective assessment of 38 symptoms, which included: memory impairment, concentration, fatigue, anxiety, the presence of panic attacks, pain of various localizations, etc. The neuroimaging examination included structural MRI and\u00a0 1 H-MRI, performed on a SIGNA Architect 3 Tl tomograph (GE HealthCare, General Electric, USA).RESULTS: The majority of the (n=170) was represented by women (80%). Over\u00a0 2\u20443 of the respondents belonged to the working-age population; the average age was 38.2\u00b111.3 years. The most common symptoms of the acute phase of NCI were: an increase in body temperature above 38\u02daC, shortness of breath during physical exertion, and impaired consciousness. Most often in the post-COVID period, patients presented the following non-specific complaints: hair loss (56.6%), decreased/increased appetite (52.6%), pain in different parts of the abdomen (45.7%), fluctuations in blood pressure, the frequency of which increased with increasing age (p<0.05). The frequency of complaints about fluctuations in blood pressure and hair loss was associated with a more severe COVID-19 (p<0.05). According to the results of the neurological examination, 53.8% of the respondents had some kind of disorder related to the functioning of the structures of the central and peripheral nervous systems. The most common in people in the post-COVID period were anxiety and depressive disorders (30%), insomnia (14.6%), tension headache (13.1%), and amnesia syndrome (6.2%). Dysthymia (2.3%), migraine (2.3%), asthenic syndrome (2.3%), persistent perceptual postural dizziness (3.1%), mild cognitive impairment (1.5%), etc. were also detected. With MoCA, a significant decrease in the general state of cognitive functions was found in 7.7% of respondents in the post-COVID period. The conducted experimental psychological examination revealed the following leading violations of the higher mental functions of individuals: a decrease in long-term memory (7.7\u00b11.7 with a norm of 8), insufficiency of the memorization process (9.2\u00b11.1 with a norm of 10), a decrease in attention stability (1.01\u00b10.3 with a norm of <1), significant difficulties in performing samples of spatial praxis (errors were made in 43.6%), and optical-spatial gnosis (only 5.7% coped without errors). Attention is drawn to the severity of symptoms of asthenia, which 64.9% of participants complained about after suffering COVID-19. In the results of MRI studies, the most common signs were general cortical atrophy (45%), focal changes (35%), cystic changes in the pineal body (25%), and signs of hippocampal atrophy (15%). Changes in the ratios of metabolites were noted in the MRC results\u00a0\u2013 a decrease in NAA/Cr (20%), and an increase in Cho/Cr (20%), an increase in mI were noted in 10% of cases.DISCUSSION: The results obtained within the framework of neurological and neuropsychological examination indicate the presence of a predominantly modal-nonspecific factor lesion, that is, changes in the processes of activation/inactivation of brain structures, contributing, among other things, to the occurrence of the above-mentioned anxiety and depressive states. The described disorders indicate the leading role of damage to the structures of the first block of the brain according to A.R. Luria, indicating the presence of damage in persons in the postcovid period in the area of the mediobasal cortex of the frontal lobes, hippocampus, and stem structures. In addition, imaging ultrastructural data (MRS) has the potential to be a neuromarker of manifestations of post-COVID neurological syndrome.CONCLUSION: Post-COVID syndrome is characterized by multi-systemic manifestations, while central nervous system lesions can be attributed to the most common complications of infection caused by SARS-CoV-2. The conducted study demonstrates the high frequency and versatility of manifestations of post-COVID disorders on the part of the nervous system, regardless of the severity of the disease, which in some cases were reflected in the framework of radiological studies. Future work involves the use of complex clinical, radiological, laboratory immunological, virological and genetic techniques to search for predisposing factors, understand the mechanism of pathogenesis, and possible ways to influence and prevent the development of postcovid syndrome.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-01-28", "synthetic_support_claim": "Post-COVID syndrome frequently involves central nervous system complications, detectable via neuroimaging and MRI abnormalities.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Long COVID leads to permanent and irreversible brain damage in all affected individuals."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "b25ae4b4bd9393744dd64006e42cf85b80287775", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b25ae4b4bd9393744dd64006e42cf85b80287775", "title": "The Influence of Social Media on the Perception of Autism Spectrum Disorders: Content Analysis of Public Discourse on YouTube Videos", "abstract": "Background: Little is known about how social media shapes the public\u2019s perception of autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

Thirty-one autistic youth were interviewed with a strength-based protocol, enabling them to provide responses in the modality of their choice. Dynamics between youth and their environments such as home, school, and community were explored. Youth were questioned about their interests, plans for the future, experiences with various emotions, and experience of autism. Based on a thematic analysis, six themes emerged: (1) autistic identities, (2) thinking about the future, (3) seeking social connection on their own terms, (4) seeking autonomy, (5) school as both a stressor and social facilitator, and (6) experiences of stress and anxiety. The experiences described by autistic youth parallel many of the aspirations and challenges of typically developing adolescents, while being uniquely shaped by their autism. We discuss how these insights shared by autistic youth can facilitate active involvement in their communities, promote well-being, and promote optimal transition into adulthood. Autism Voices demonstrates that partnering with multiple stakeholders and the use of inclusive methodologies are pivotal steps toward capturing the voices of all autistic youth. Lay abstract Currently, our understanding of the adolescent period for autistic youth has relied on the expertise of researchers, clinicians, parents, and teachers, yet rarely involves their unique first-person experiences. Our study attempted to understand the experiences and perspectives of autistic adolescents in their home, school, and community environments using the Autism Voices protocol, a semi-structured interview specifically designed and tailored to engage with autistic youth with various language and intellectual levels. The analysis of the 31 interviews conducted with autistic adolescents aged 11\u201318\u2009years highlighted six themes: (1) autistic identities, (2) thinking about the future, (3) seeking social connection on their own terms, (4) seeking autonomy, (5) school as both a stressor and social facilitator, and (6) experiences of stress and anxiety. These results highlight similarities and differences in the adolescent experiences of autistic youth compared to their typically developing peers. Our findings suggest that by removing assumptions about the experiences of autistic individuals and investing in inclusive interview methods, we can faithfully capture the experiences of autistic youth regardless of their communication and cognitive abilities.

Autistic narratives and lived experiences consistently link camouflaging to anxiety, depression, suicide risks, and autistic burnout. Quantitative research is yet to determine the nature of these relationships, with a significant portion of recent studies providing inconsistent evidence. While camouflaging can be a compelled survival strategy in social environments, it might also contribute to positive outcomes such as securing employment and forming positive social relationships, implicating a complex interrelationship with mental health and wellbeing. We advocate for using a transactional impression management framework to understand camouflaging and wellbeing and address the inconsistencies in research. Through examining the transactions among a person's individual and cognitive characteristics, behavior modification strategies, and the particular social contexts they find themselves in, this framework guides new empirical research directions to delineate the relationships between camouflaging, impression management, mental health, and wellbeing. There is a need to develop multiple measures of camouflaging that delineate the motivations, ability, effortfulness, and perceived effectiveness of camouflaging and examine how a person's social behaviors are perceived in different social environments.

A total of 5 558 reports were contributed by 151 adolescents, including 90 with symptoms of anxiety and/or depression. The study was conducted in the poorest neighbourhoods of Bogot\u00e1, Buenos Aires, and Lima.Results: Multi-level modelling indicated that using resources was significantly associated with less nervousness and sadness.

Grounded in a phenomenological approach, the study utilizes a case study design to explore the lived experiences of 14 participants, including educators, parents, and health professionals. Data collection through focus group discussions enables a nuanced understanding of the complexities surrounding suicide prevention in rural educational settings. Research findings indicate that educators frequently struggle to identify suicidal tendencies among male learners due to cultural stigma surrounding mental health and lack of training in psychological assessment. Communication gaps with parents and health professionals further complicate these challenges. Conversely, successful intervention mechanisms identified in the study include peer support programs and mental health awareness campaigns, which create supportive environments and empower learners to seek help and engage in open discussions about mental health. Based on these findings, the study recommends that educational authorities implement comprehensive training programs for educators to equip them with the necessary skills to identify and address suicidal propensities among learners. Such training should encompass mental health education, communication strategies, and cultural sensitivity.

This narrative review describes studies on the neural mechanisms associated with reward motivation and their relationships with cognitive function in healthy human participants. The brain\u2019s meso-limbic dopamine reward circuitry in humans is known to control reward-motivated behavior in humans. The medial and lateral Pre-Frontal Cortex (PFC) integrate motivation and cognitive control during decision-making and the dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC) integrates and transmits signals of reward to the mesolimbic and meso-cortical dopamine circuits and initiates motivated behavior. The thalamus and insula influence incentive processing in humans and the motor system plays a role in response to action control. There are reciprocal relationships between reward motivation, learning, memory, imagery, working memory, and attention. The most common method of assessing reward motivation is the monetary incentive delay task (DMRT) and there are several meta-analyses of this paradigm. Genetics modulates motivation reward, and dopamine provides the basis for the interaction between motivational and cognitive control. There is some evidence that male adolescents take more risky decisions than female adolescents and that the lateralization of reward-related DA release in the ventral striatum is confined to men. These studies have implications for our understanding of natural reward and psychiatric conditions like addiction, depression and ADHD. Furthermore, the association between reward and memory can help develop treatment techniques for drug addiction that interfere with consolidation of memory. Finally, there is a lack of research on reward motivation, genetics and sex differences and this can improve our understanding of the relationships between reward, motivation and the brain.", "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-03-24", "synthetic_support_claim": "The dorsolateral PFC integrates and transmits signals of reward to dopamine circuits initiating motivated behavior.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Environmental factors have a greater influence on reward motivation than genetic factors and neural mechanisms."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "e48bfc89ca881caedf95f5089a87ac0c27fac977", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e48bfc89ca881caedf95f5089a87ac0c27fac977", "title": "Brain insulin resistance in neurological disorders of various genesis: current state and treatment approaches", "abstract": "Nowadays, the phenomenon insulin resistance (IR) has expanded and include not only peripheral, but also central IR.

These stressors may be caused by two sources of threat, firstly, the loss of bonding with the caregiver and later with a partner and/or group which relates to the SEPARATION (PANIC/GRIEF) system, secondly, social defeat as an expression of the social competition and social dominance. The sexual maturity drives the individual to social competition and social dominance, even if the latter often occurs before sexual maturity, e.g., chickens, dogs, non-human primates, and humans. Depression is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism in mammals to terminate both separation anxiety, so as to protect the vulnerable social brain from the consequences of prolonged separation anxiety, and the stress of social competition when social defeat is predictable. Adolescence and Young adulthood are particularly susceptible to these two types of threat because of human developmental characteristics that are summarized by the term neoteny. This refers to the slowing down of growth and development, resulting in both a prolonged period of dependence on a caring/protective adult and the persistence of juvenile characteristics throughout life. Therefore, neoteny makes the transition from childhood to sexual maturity more dramatic, making the integration of the SEPARATION (PANIC/GRIEF) system with the dynamics of social competition and dominance more stressful and a source of depression. Stress is an expression of the HPA-Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal axis that articulates with other systems, mainly the autonomic nervous system and the immune-inflammatory system. The latter is believed to be one of the most significant components in the dynamics of depressive processes, connected to the prodromes of its activation in childhood, under the pressure of environmental and relational stressors which can lead to learned helplessness. The recurrence of stressors makes it easier for the immune-inflammatory system to be activated in later life, which could make a significant contribution to the establishment of a depressive disease. The possible contribution of children's identification processes with their parents' depressive personalities through observational learning is considered.", "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-01-06", "synthetic_support_claim": "Depression is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism in mammals to terminate both separation anxiety and social defeat.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Dietary factors have a direct and significant impact on the development and severity of depression."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "59a3b569495b52c5910c7cb46a162646e68c7ede", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/59a3b569495b52c5910c7cb46a162646e68c7ede", "title": "Influence of Stress and Emotions in the Learning Process: The Example of COVID-19 on University Students: A Narrative Review", "abstract": "Emotional instability and stress are the main disturbances that condition the learning process, affecting both teachers and students.

In this context, stress tends to be seen as a negative condition in the learning process when it is chronic. Extreme stress situations, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, can generate anxiety and frustration in students.

Stress coping strategies are expected to enhance students' performance during OSCE. The objective was to determine the effect of short preventive coping interventions on performance of medical students.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nDouble-blinded, randomized controlled trial with multiple arms and a superiority hypothesis. Enrolment was proposed to each fourth-year undergraduate medical student convened to the Lyon Est University OSCE in 2022. There was no exclusion criterion. Students were randomized to one of four groups: standardized breathing with cardiac biofeedback (BFB), mindfulness-based intervention (MBI), positive psychology intervention (PPI), or control (CTRL). Each intervention was video-guided, lasted six minutes, and occurred just before starting the OSCE. The primary outcome was the academic OSCE score, assessed through specific grids by university examiners blinded to the interventions. Secondary outcomes included specific performance scores, and student perception of the influence of the intervention on their performance.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 482 students were included. No difference was found between BFB (-0.17 [95%CI, -1.20 to 0.86], p\u2009=\u2009.749), MBI (0.32 [95%CI, -0.71 to 1.36], p\u2009=\u2009.540), or PPI groups (-0.25 [95%CI, -1.29 to 0.79], p\u2009=\u2009.637) on the academic OSCE score compared to the control group, nor regarding the specific performance scores.

While hyperactivity of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) appears to be critically involved, the molecular mechanisms underlying comorbid depressive symptoms in chronic pain remain elusive. T cell lymphoma invasion and metastasis 1 (Tiam1) is a Rac1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that promotes dendrite, spine, and synapse development during brain development. Here, we show that Tiam1 orchestrates synaptic structural and functional plasticity in ACC neurons via actin cytoskeleton reorganization and synaptic N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) stabilization.

Given the fast-paced, innovation-driven demands of the high-tech sector, this research provides insights into how managers can effectively balance contradictory behaviors to drive team innovation.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nData was collected through a two-wave survey from team leaders and members across 169 teams in high-tech manufacturing companies. The time interval between data collection waves was two weeks. The data was aggregated at the team level using estimates for interrater reliability and interrater agreement. The structural equation modeling in R was used to test hypotheses.\n\nFindings\nThe findings indicate that PXL positively impacts team creativity directly and through its influence on team ambidexterity. Team ambidexterity mediates the relationship between PXL and team creativity, while leader vision moderates the effects of PXL on team ambidexterity.\n\nPractical implications\nPXL benefits high-performance teams in technology sectors, such as software development, where rapid innovation and iterative processes are essential. In health care, PXL can optimize team dynamics, enabling medical research and patient care delivery breakthroughs. Regular training in ambidextrous thinking and feedback mechanisms makes this approach actionable for managers striving to cultivate creativity in high-stakes environments.\n\nOriginality/value\nThis study extends ambidexterity theory by linking PXL and team ambidexterity to team creativity.

The present study focuses on the efforts of parents of children with autism spectrum disorder to improve their situation during the pandemic. In particular, the objective is to identify promoting variables (subjective well-being, positive mental health, social support, humour, cognitive reappraisal, and self-esteem) and sociodemographic variables that predict resilience, marking positive coping with this adverse situation. Furthermore, the study conceptually explores the potential role of emotional intelligence in resilience-building processes. We hypothesised that higher scores in these promoting variables would predict greater resilience, with emotional intelligence potentially serving as an underlying framework. The methodology employed in this study is as follows: A cross-sectional predictive study was conducted on a sample of 799 parents using an online questionnaire administered during the social confinement resulting from the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The information analysed is based on data provided by the parents. Statistical methods included Student\u2019s t-tests, Pearson\u2019s correlations, and stepwise multivariate regression analysis to identify predictors of resilience.

This study presents findings on racial discrimination and maladaptive eating behaviors (overeating, LOC eating) using ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Methods Black emerging adult women (N = 27) with overweight or obesity participated in a 14\u2010day EMA study examining exposure to racial discrimination, eating behaviors, and racial identity. Frequencies and chi\u2010square tests were used to characterize the type of racial discrimination experienced and frequency of overeating. Mixed effect ordinal logistic regression models were used to assess the relation between racial discrimination and maladaptive eating. Moderation analysis was conducted by creating interaction terms for discrimination and racial identity variables. Results 81.5% of participants reported experiencing racial discrimination. Young Black women reporting exposure to racial discrimination were more likely to endorse higher levels of both overeating and LOC eating compared to times when discrimination was not experienced (p\u2009<\u2009.0001). Racial identity moderated the link between racial discrimination and maladaptive eating (overeating, LOC) such that reporting greater levels of private regard buffered the deleterious effect of racial discrimination. Higher levels of public regard exacerbated the association between racial discrimination and both overeating, and LOC. Higher centrality worsened the relation between racial discrimination and LOC. Conclusion Young Black women might use maladaptive eating to cope with exposure to racial discrimination, which underscores the importance of examining the link between racism and disordered eating, particularly among Black women submerged in a society that continuously exposes them to racial discrimination. Public Significance Emerging adult Black women are exposed to racial discrimination daily. In theory, exposure to racial discrimination could contribute to overeating and loss of control eating in this population.

We used interrupted time-series analysis to estimate the impact of COVID-19 (March 2020) and 're-opening' (December 2021), when many restrictions were lifted in Australia. We compared effects in the jurisdictions with most disruptions and lockdowns with other jurisdictions.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere were 201,755 self-poisonings documented, 64% female, with 19,946 children (aged 5-14, 9.9%) and 44,388 adolescents (aged 15-19, 22.0%). There was a steep increase in the rate of poisoning in female children and adolescents - with the annual increase being 1.361 (95% confidence interval = [1.074, 1.735]) and 1.154 (95% confidence interval = [1.049, 1.283]) times faster than pre-pandemic trends in these two groups between March 2020 and December 2021. Following relaxation of restrictions, there was a sudden drop and then slow decline in self-poisonings (despite rising COVID-19 infection rates). There was an overall 29.6% increase in intentional poisonings in young people over the study period. This is markedly more pronounced among young females (37.0%) vs males (11.2%). There were substantial jurisdictional variations, with larger increases in Victoria, Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThere has been a marked increase in child and adolescent female self-poisonings over the last 6 years, with increases strongly associated with COVID-19 pandemic restrictions but persisting after their removal.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-11-18", "synthetic_support_claim": "There has been a marked increase in female child and adolescent self-poisonings over the last 6 years.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "There is a genetic predisposition to self-poisoning in young females."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "a01dd396d31eb25c4ef6f57cdffcb74e9386cf4d", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a01dd396d31eb25c4ef6f57cdffcb74e9386cf4d", "title": "Factors associated with extended length of stay for paediatric mental health presentations to EDs in South Western Sydney, Australia", "abstract": "Abstract Objective This study aimed to determine the factors associated with extended length of stay (LOS) for paediatric mental health (MH)\u2010related presentations to the EDs in South Western Sydney (SWS).

Extended LOS was defined as encounters of more than 4\u2009h. We assessed factors associated with extended LOS using a multi\u2010level logistic regression model, accounting for hospital\u2010level clustering. Results Approximately, 57.6% of all paediatric MH\u2010related ED presentations involved extended LOS. ED presentations by adolescents, patients with a culturally and linguistically diverse background, and those with ambulance arrival had increased odds of extended LOS compared to their counterparts. The odds of extended LOS were lower for encounters that occurred on weekends compared to weekdays, but the odds were higher for presentations that happened at night than during the day. Deliberate self\u2010harm, eating disorder, and schizophrenia spectrum disorders/psychosis\u2010related presentations had higher odds of extended LOS than other MH\u2010related presentations. Patients with MH presentations that required urgent evaluation (triage levels 1\u20132) had higher odds of extended LOS.

Olfactory and cognitive disorders represent important non-motor symptoms in Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). No clear evidence was reported about association of specific cognitive domains and olfactory impairment. Objective. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between olfactory dysfunction and specific cognitive domains in PD patients compared to controls. Methods. 178 PD patients and 98 controls were enrolled and evaluated for odor threshold (OT), discrimination (OD), identification (OI), and TDI score using the Sniffin\u2019 Sticks test. Cognitive function was evaluated using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment scale with six sub-scores: Orientation (OIS), Attention (AIS), Language (LIS), Visuospatial (VIS), Memory (MIS), and Executive index scores (EIS). Results. Statistically significant correlations were observed between OT versus, LIS, and between TDI score versus EIS. Multivariate linear regression analysis, including age and sex which are well-known predictors of olfactory dysfunction, showed that, among specific cognitive domains, only LIS was significant predictor for OT, VIS was a significant predictor for OD, while both EIS and AIS were significant predictors for OI, and finally only EIS was significant predictor for TDI score.

Social isolation is associated with multiple adverse health outcomes in older adults, including depression.

In this qualitative study, we elicited lived experiences of older adults with SLE related to social connections and emotional health. Methods Adults \u226565 years of age with SLE participated in semistructured interviews based on a descriptive phenomenological design to describe the experience of aging with SLE. We collected self\u2010reported data on sociodemographic and disease characteristics, social networks, and health\u2010related quality of life. We probed participants regarding their interpersonal relationships and the effect of SLE on general health in the context of aging. We analyzed qualitative data thematically. Results Among 30 participants with a mean age of 71.3 years, three themes emerged as essential to characterizing aging with SLE: (1) social isolation, (2) perceived burden to loved ones, and (3) adverse mental health effects of SLE. Participants frequently reported social isolation, often related to SLE disease manifestations rather than unavailability of social networks and situated within the context of burdening loved ones and mental health effects of SLE. Conclusion Social isolation was commonly reported by older adults with SLE.

Methods We searched PubMed, Web of Science, EMbase, The Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Database, and China Science and Technology Journal Database (CQVIP) for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the impact of exercise on inhibitory function in MDD patients, from database inception to July 2024. Two researchers independently evaluated the quality of the included studies using the Risk of Bias (ROB 2.0) tool. Evidence quality was assessed with the GRADE profiler software, and effect sizes were combined using Stata 17.0 software to create forest plots, test for publication bias, and perform sensitivity analyses. Results A total of nine RCTs involving 1038 participants from six countries, published between 2001 and 2022, were included. The average age of participants in both the experimental and control groups was 45 years. Meta\u2010analysis results indicated that exercise significantly improves inhibitory function in MDD patients, with a combined effect size (SMD = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.18\u20130.77, p < 0.001). Subgroup analysis showed that exercise had a statistically significant effect on inhibitory control in MDD patients, with an effect size (SMD = 0.563, p < 0.001). Regarding exercise elements, other types of exercise (resistance exercise RE, mixed exercise ME), duration greater than 45 min, intervention period of \u226412 weeks, frequency of two times per week, and low intensity were found to be more effective, all with statistical significance (SMD = 0.863, p < 0.001; SMD = 0.936, p < 0.001; SMD = 0.525, p = 0.002; SMD = 0.682, p = 0.004; SMD = 0.94, p = 0.00). Conclusion Based on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) classification systems, a research framework for exercise interventions on executive function in MDD patients was constructed, demonstrating that exercise can improve inhibitory function in MDD with high evidence quality. Our study found that other types of exercise (RE or ME), intervention duration of >45 min, intervention period of \u226412 weeks, frequency of two times per week, and low intensity are more effective for improving inhibitory function in MDD patients. While the overall methodological quality of the literature was good, high heterogeneity existed among studies. Subgroup analysis suggested that sources of heterogeneity included measurement tools, exercise types, exercise intensity, duration, and frequency. Sensitivity analysis indicated that exercise duration and period might be causes of heterogeneity. This study has some limitations as the included literature did not consider disease duration, depression severity, or categorize age groups. However, the findings provide strong evidence for clinical practice and future research on the beneficial effects of exercise on inhibitory function in MDD patients.

An Expectancy-Discrepancy-Threat Model of Masculine Identity", "abstract": "Academic Abstract Manhood is a precarious social status. Under perceived gender identity threat, men are disproportionately likely to enact certain stereotype-consistent responses such as aggression to maintain their gender status. Yet less is known regarding individual variation in men\u2019s threat responsiveness\u2014that is, the psychological conditions under which one\u2019s masculine identity is more or less \u201cfragile.\u201d We propose a novel model of masculine identity whereby masculine norm expectancy generates discrepancy within the self to the extent that rigid norms are internalized as obligational (actual-ought discrepancy) versus aspirational (actual-ideal discrepancy), which predict extrinsic versus intrinsic motivations to reduce these discrepancies, respectively. Under threat, then, extrinsic motivations predict externalized responses (e.g., aggression), and intrinsic motivations elicit internalized responses (e.g., anxiety, shame, self-harm). We also consider the conditions under which masculinity may be less fragile\u2014for example, in contexts with less rigid expectations and among men who reject expectations\u2014as pathways to mitigate adverse masculinity threat-related outcomes. Public Abstract In many cultures, men prove their manhood by engaging in behaviors that harm themselves and others (e.g., violence, sexism, homophobia), particularly people from marginalized groups. Yet less is known about why some men are more likely than others to enact these masculinity-proving behaviors. The goal of our model is to specify certain conditions under which masculinities become \u201cfragile\u201d and elicit these responses when under threat.

The results revealed a full serial mediation for women; lookism climate was positively related to workplace incivility, which in turn was related to imposter syndrome, negatively impacting perceived employability. For men, no serial mediation was found; lookism climate was directly related to both incivility and imposter syndrome, with no significant relationship between the two. Like women, men experienced a negative relationship between imposter syndrome and perceived employability, yet this relationship was stronger for men.

In particular, the EPO considers perceived attributes of female targets in conjunction with male perceivers' feelings of power. Extending Objectification Theory's suggestion that objectification is pervasive because of the patriarchal cultures women live in, the EPO suggests that objectification is instrumental in men's attempts to preserve and regain their position within the patriarchy. Among men who endorse patriarchal ideologies, perceived patriarchy threat or security is theorized to interact with evaluations of female targets to predict whether objectifying perceptions of female targets result in benevolent, derogative, or dismissive objectifying behaviors.

Though still an emerging technology, emotional artificial intelligence (EAI) is increasingly incorporated into enterprise systems to augment and automate organizational decisions and to monitor and manage workers. EAI use is often celebrated for its potential to improve workers' wellbeing and performance as well as address organizational problems such as bias and safety. Workers subject to EAI in the workplace are data subjects whose data make EAI possible and who are most impacted by it. However, we lack empirical knowledge about data subjects' perspectives on EAI, including in the workplace. To this end, using a relational ethics lens, we qualitatively analyzed 395 U.S. adults' open-ended survey (partly representative) responses regarding the perceived benefits and risks they associate with being subjected to EAI in the workplace. While participants acknowledged potential benefits of being subject to EAI (e.g., employers using EAI to aid their wellbeing, enhance their work environment, reduce bias), a myriad of potential risks overshadowed perceptions of potential benefits. Participants expressed concerns regarding the potential for EAI use to harm their wellbeing, work environment and employment status, and create and amplify bias and stigma against them, especially the most marginalized (e.g., along dimensions of race, gender, mental health status, disability). Distrustful of EAI and its potential risks, participants anticipated conforming to (e.g., partaking in emotional labor) or refusing (e.g., quitting a job) EAI implementation in practice.

Defined as persistent virtual worlds that exist in virtual or augmented reality, the metaverse proposes to afford a range of activities of daily life, from socializing and relaxing to gaming, shopping, and working. Because of its scope, its projected popularity, and its immersivity, the metaverse may pose unique opportunities and risks for mental health. In this viewpoint article, we integrate existing evidence on the mental health impacts of video games, social media, and virtual reality to anticipate how the metaverse could influence mental health. We outline 2 categories of mechanisms related to mental health: experiences or behaviors afforded by the metaverse and experiences or behaviors displaced by it. The metaverse may benefit mental health by affording control (over an avatar and its virtual environment), cognitive activation, physical activity, social connections, and a sense of autonomy and competence. However, repetitive rewarding experiences may lead to addiction-like behaviors, and high engagement in virtual worlds may facilitate and perpetuate the avoidance of challenges in the offline environment. Further, time spent in virtual worlds may displace (reduce) other determinants of mental health, such as sleep rhythms and offline social capital. Importantly, individuals will differ in their uses of and psychological responses to the metaverse, resulting in heterogeneous impacts on their mental health. Their technological motivations, developmental stage, sociodemographic context, and prior mental health problems are some of the factors that may modify and frame the positive and negative effects of the metaverse on their mental health. In conclusion, as the metaverse is being scaffolded by the industry and by its users, there is a window of opportunity for researchers, clinicians, and people with lived experience to coproduce knowledge on its possible impacts on mental health and illness, with the hope of influencing policy-making, technological development, and counseling of patients.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-10-10", "synthetic_support_claim": "The metaverse may benefit mental health by affording control over an avatar and its environment.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "The metaverse will universally improve mental health outcomes for all individuals regardless of their background."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "c5d3545946f143f33f37f965c9480a3a6c8650b0", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c5d3545946f143f33f37f965c9480a3a6c8650b0", "title": "Extended Reality Trans Technologies: Bridging Digital and Physical Worlds to Support Transgender People", "abstract": "Extended reality (XR) technologies are becoming increasingly pervasive, and may have capacity to help marginalized groups such as transgender people.

We ask here whether social play behavior, a particular form of social interaction that is highly abundant during postweaning development, is equally important for setting up connections in the developing prefrontal cortex (PFC). Young male rats were deprived from social play with peers during the period in life when social play behavior normally peaks [postnatal day 21\u201342] (SPD rats), followed by resocialization until adulthood. We recorded synaptic currents in layer 5 cells in slices from medial PFC of adult SPD and control rats and observed that inhibitory synaptic currents were reduced in SPD slices, while excitatory synaptic currents were unaffected. This was associated with a decrease in perisomatic inhibitory synapses from parvalbumin-positive GABAergic cells. In parallel experiments, adult SPD rats achieved more reversals in a probabilistic reversal learning (PRL) task, which depends on the integrity of the PFC, by using a more simplified cognitive strategy than controls. Interestingly, we observed that one daily hour of play during SPD partially rescued the behavioral performance in the PRL, but did not prevent the decrease in PFC inhibitory synaptic inputs. Our data demonstrate the importance of unrestricted social play for the development of inhibitory synapses in the PFC and cognitive skills in adulthood and show that specific synaptic alterations in the PFC can result in a complex behavioral outcome. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT This study addressed the question whether social play behavior in juvenile rats contributes to functional development of the prefrontal cortex (PFC). We found that rats that had been deprived from juvenile social play (social play deprivation - SPD) showed a reduction in inhibitory synapses in the PFC and a simplified strategy to solve a complex behavioral task in adulthood. Providing one daily hour of play during SPD partially rescued the cognitive skills in these rats, but did not prevent the reduction in PFC inhibitory synapses.

We evaluated possible influences of social play on the development of behavior along the caution/boldness continuum in juvenile Belding\u2019s ground squirrels (Urocitellus beldingi). We disrupted juvenile squirrels engaged in play by walking toward them until their play interactions stopped. We used undisrupted juveniles and juveniles disrupted while not engaged in play as controls. Caution was measured with behavioral tests during which a human intruder walked toward a squirrel and recorded the distances at which the squirrel first noticed and then fled from the intruder. Rates of social play were lower and play bouts were shorter in play-disrupted juveniles than in undisrupted and nonplay-disrupted juveniles. The distances at which juveniles noticed and fled from an intruder increased across the developmental period in which play primarily occurs, suggesting increases in caution across this interval. Increases in the distances to notice and flee from an intruder did not differ between undisrupted and nonplay-disrupted juveniles, but were greater in these groups than in play-disrupted juveniles.

The aim of this study was to elucidate the effects of social play deprivation, specifically on the responsivity to social and non-social challenges. We hypothesised that play deprivation leads to impairments in stress resilience later in life, particularly in social contexts. To test this, play-deprived rats were compared with undeprived control rats for their responsivity to (1) a novel environment, (2) facing an aggressive male rat in its territory (resident-intruder test) and (3) an encounter with two unfamiliar conspecifics in a neutral, familiar environment (stranger encounter test). Corticosterone concentrations in response to these different stressors were comparable between play-deprived and control rats. Behavioural analysis revealed that play-deprived rats responded similar to undeprived controls when confronted with an aggressive rat in its territory. In the stranger encounter test, the unfamiliar strangers directed more play behaviour towards play-deprived animals than towards undeprived control animals.

However, its biological basis and effective training strategies remain under-explored. Many athletes face psychological challenges that affect their overall well-being and performance. Furthermore, resilience training can benefit from a greater awareness of the biomechanical components of athletes\u2019 performance.

Objective: The study aims (1) to explore the resilience profiles of athletes categorized as high resilience group and moderate resilience group, (2) to assess the biomechanical characteristics associated with these resilience profiles through sensor data, and (3) to determine the relationships between resilience, health-related behaviors, well-being, and perceived social support. Methodology: A cross-sectional online survey with 120 participants was conducted to assess health-related behaviors and well-being pre- and post-intervention. Additionally, biomechanical sensors were used to capture athletes\u2019 movement and performance during training sessions. Data was collected using the social support scale and resilience scale.

The pandemic period was divided into categories of remote learning (17 March 2020 to 30 June 2020, 8 January 2021 to 16 February 2021, 12 April 2021 to 30 June 2021) and in-person learning (remaining pandemic dates). The summer holidays pre-pandemic were in July\u2013August 2017, 2018, 2019 and during the pandemic they were in July\u2013August 2020 and 2021. Logistic regressions were conducted to analyze data. Findings related to COVID-19 showed bullying rates to be lower during the pandemic when compared to pre-pandemic levels (bullied others during pandemic in school: OR = 0.44, CI = 0.34\u20130.57; victim of bullying during pandemic in school: OR = 0.41, CI = 0.33\u20130.5). Furthermore, bullying rates were lower during the pandemic periods when schools were closed for in-person learning (bullied others during pandemic remote: OR = 0.62, CI = 0.45\u20130.85; victim of bullying during pandemic remote: OR = 0.24, CI = 0.17\u20130.34). Children who lived in lower income areas, experienced home life challenges, exhibited mental health difficulties, or had behavioural concerns were more likely to be involved in bullying experiences. Finally, classroom type and school program impacted the child\u2019s likelihood of bullying others or being bullied.

Here, 3 mg/kg IP psilocybin was found to have anxiolytic-like effects in C57BL/6 male mice at 4 h after treatment. These effects were not altered by pretreatment with a 5-HT2A antagonist but were blunted by pretreatment with a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist or suppression of psilocybin-induced corticosterone elevations. Anxiolytic-like effects were also observed at 4 h following treatment with the nonpsychedelic 5-HT2A agonist lisuride at a dose causing a similar increase in plasma glucocorticoids as that seen with psilocybin, as well as following stress-induced (via repeated injection) glucocorticoid release alone. Psilocybin\u2019s anxiolytic-like effects persisted at 7 days following administration. The long-term anxiolytic effects of psilocybin were lost when psilocybin was administered to animals with ongoing chronic elevations in plasma corticosterone concentrations.

In this study, we investigated psilocybin administration in male and female SAPAP3 knockout (KO) mice, a well-validated mouse model of obsessive compulsive and related disorders. We assessed the effects of acute psilocybin (1 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) administration on head twitch and locomotor behaviour as well as anxiety- and compulsive-like behaviours at multiple time-points (1-, 3- and 8-days post-injection). While psilocybin did not have any effect on anxiety-like behaviours, we revealed for the first time that acute psilocybin administration led to enduring reductions in compulsive behaviour in male SAPAP3 KO mice and reduced grooming behaviour in female WT and SAPAP3 KO mice. We also found that psilocybin increased locomotion in wild-type littermates but not in SAPAP3 KO mice, suggesting in vivo serotonergic dysfunctions in KO animals. On the other hand, the typical head-twitch response following acute psilocybin (confirming its hallucinogenic-like effect at this dose) was observed in both genotypes.

The present research explores the mediating roles of self-compassion and emotion regulation strategies (cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression) on the relationship between academic teachers\u2019 psychological resilience and mental health. Methods A total of 405 academic teachers from four colleges in Tabuk City, Saudi Arabia, participated in the study between September and November 2023. The standardized questionnaires measuring psychological resilience (The Brief Resilience Scale- BRS), self-compassion (The Self-Compassion Scale-SCS), emotion regulation (The Emotion Regulation Scale-ERS), and mental health (General Health Questionnaire-12) were used to collect data. The bivariate correlation, regression, and path analysis were employed to investigate their associations. Results The findings demonstrated a significant positive impact of psychological resilience on mental health (\u03b2=0.39, p<0.001). Self-compassion emerged as a significant positive mediator, strengthening the association between resilience and mental health (\u03b2=0.18, p<0.01).

A multidimensional approach", "abstract": "Introduction The ageing population presents a significant demographic and socio-economic challenge for the European Union (EU). Declining fertility rates, coupled with increasing life expectancy, have led to a growing proportion of older individuals within the population, raising concerns about their quality of life. This study aims to assess the quality of life for seniors across EU countries in the years 2015, 2019, and 2022, with a particular focus on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The research seeks to answer the following question: How has the quality of life among seniors in the EU evolved over time, and how has the COVID-19 pandemic affected this trajectory? We hypothesize that the pandemic has exacerbated existing socio-economic inequalities, particularly affecting the most vulnerable older populations. Methods This study utilises the Synthetic Measure of Senior Quality of Life (SMSQoL) to evaluate the living conditions of seniors across four critical domains: health, finances, social relations, and environment. Data for the analysis were drawn from Eurostat and national statistical reports, complemented by pilot studies conducted in selected EU countries. The pilot studies focused on gathering qualitative data to supplement the quantitative measures, especially in areas where standardised data were incomplete or unavailable. The assessment spans three years: 2015 (pre-pandemic baseline), 2019 (immediate pre-pandemic), and 2022 (post-pandemic). The analysis includes 27 EU member states and uses both descriptive and inferential statistical methods to evaluate trends and disparities. Cross-sectional analysis was applied to examine the impact of differing social policies, levels of social security, access to healthcare, and economic strength across these countries. Results The analysis reveals significant disparities in the quality of life among seniors across EU countries, with pronounced differences between regions. In particular: Northern and Western Europe: seniors in these regions generally experienced improved overall life quality over the observed period. Countries such as Sweden and Germany reported gains in health, financial stability, and social relations, largely due to strong social policies and robust healthcare systems. Eastern Europe: Seniors in Eastern European countries, including Romania and Bulgaria, continued to face substantial challenges, with minimal improvements in quality of life. Economic instability, limited access to healthcare, and weaker social security systems were identified as key contributors to this stagnation. Impact of COVID-19: the pandemic exacerbated existing inequalities, particularly in the domains of social relations and finances. Seniors in economically vulnerable regions were disproportionately affected by social isolation and reduced income, intensifying the pre-existing challenges in their living conditions. Quantitative analysis confirmed that while some regions showed resilience, the most vulnerable populations experienced a sharp decline in their overall quality of life, particularly between 2019 and 2022. Discussion The findings from this study highlight the persistence of economic and social inequalities in the life conditions among seniors across the EU. While countries in Northern and Western Europe have made strides in improving senior living conditions, Eastern Europe continues to face significant challenges. The COVID-19 pandemic acted as a catalyst, exacerbating these inequalities, particularly in terms of social isolation and financial insecurity. These results align with previous studies that have highlighted the uneven impact of social policies and economic strength on senior well-being across Europe. The disparities underscore the need for more balanced and equitable policy interventions that can address the vulnerabilities of older populations, particularly in regions struggling with economic instability.

We review the current evidence for the AoA effect stemming from a range of methodologies and paradigms and apply these findings to current explanations of how and where the AoA effect occurs. We conclude that the AoA effect can be found both in the connections between levels of representations and within these representations themselves, and that the effect itself occurs through the process of the distinct coding of early and late items, together with the nature of the connections between levels of representation. This approach strongly suggests that the AoA effect results from the construction of perceptual-semantic representations and the mappings between representations.

Others, such as Borgstede and Eggert, regard recourses to validity as an appeal to an (unscientific) folk psychology. Instead, they advocate theory-based measurement. It will be demonstrated that these divergent positions converge in their view of psychological theory as indispensable for the soundness of psychological measurement. However, the formulation of the concept (and scope) of scientific theory differs across the presented conceptions of validity. These differences can be at least partially attributed to three disparities in metatheoretical and methodological stances. The first concerns the question of the structure of scientific theories. The second concerns the question of psychology\u2019s subject matter.

This study provides an initial validation of a reliable span calculation from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition Letter-Number Sequencing (LNS) subtest as a performance validity indicator for youth baseline testing (Reliable Letter-Number Span; RLNS). Method: Youth athletes (n\u2009=\u2009173) underwent baseline concussion testing for the management of sport-related concussion. We classified participants as valid (n\u2009=\u2009153) or invalid performance (n\u2009=\u200920) based on several well-established performance validity tests. We calculated RLNS by summing the spans of alphanumeric characters across two items within the Letter-Number Sequencing subtest, similar to the Reliable Digit Span. To better determine the utility of RLNS, we also examined other novel reliable span metrics and established summary scores from the Letter-Number Sequencing as potential validity indicators. Results: Analyses revealed excellent classification accuracy for RLNS, with an area under the curve of .88 (95% CI [.81, .96]).

The recent trends reveal a rise in suicide rates across the Americas, while all other regions show declines over twenty years of time. This study investigates corruption\u2019s effect on suicide in 26 American countries, considering moderating factors of unemployment, inflation, and economic growth. Methods This study analysed latest two decades of available data, using stepwise panel regression method to investigate the effects of corruption and economic variables on suicide across income levels. Data were sourced from Transparency International, World Bank and the World Health Organization. Initially, unit root tests and CUSUM plots were used to ensure the stability and stationarity of the dataset, and model specification were validated through F test, LM test and Hausman test to select the ideal econometric model - POLS, REM, or FEM for the study. Results A strong suicide rate persistence revealed, particularly in high-income countries, where the lagged suicide variable showed a coefficient of 0.8063 (p < 0.001). Corruption significantly impacted suicide rates in upper-middle-income countries (coefficient = -0.0268, p < 0.05), with higher corruption perceptions scores correlating with lower suicide rates. Additionally, unemployment acted as a significant moderator, intensifying the corruption\u2019s adverse impact on suicide with a coefficient of 0.0022 (p < 0.001) in upper-middle income nations. Economic growth demonstrated a minor protective effect, particularly in high-income regions, with an interaction coefficient of -0.0005 (p < 0.1), suggesting slight suicide reduction linked to economic stability. Conclusion This study found that corruption, unemployment, and economic growth significantly influence suicide rates across the Americas.

Strong economies are important for public health investment and employment, yet the rapid rise of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to reshape economies, presenting challenges beyond mere temporary market disruption. Generative AI can perform non-routine cognitive tasks, previously unattainable though traditional automation, creating new efficiencies. While this technology offers opportunities for innovation and productivity, its labour-displacing potential raises serious concerns about economic stability and social equity, both of which are critical to health. Job displacement driven by generative AI could worsen income inequality, shrink middle-class opportunities and reduce consumer demand, triggering recessionary pressures. In this article, we propose the existence of an AI-capital-to-labour ratio threshold beyond which a self-reinforcing cycle of recessionary pressures may emerge, and which market forces alone cannot correct. Traditional responses to such pressures, like fiscal stimulus or monetary easing, may be ineffective in addressing structural disruptions to labour markets caused by generative AI. We call for a proactive global response to harness the benefits of generative AI while mitigating risks. This response should focus on reorienting economic systems towards collective well-being, as emphasized in the World Health Assembly resolution Economics of health for all and the United Nations' Global Digital Compact.

The World Health Organisation International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health, Children and Youth Version states that play is a key activity to engage children with disability in various areas of their lives, and there is no doubt that playgrounds can promote community and social engagement for all children. Consequently, accessible playgrounds are important because they can offer motor, psychological, and social skill development in a fun-filled environment. Nonetheless, some children encounter challenges in playground settings. Surprisingly, very little research has been conducted in Australia on the experiences of children with disabilities in public playgrounds. According to the National Autism Strategy announced by the Australian Government in 2022, there is a growing number of Australians on the autism spectrum. For many individuals with an autistic spectrum disorder (ASD), life outcomes in education, health, and family functioning are worse than they should be. Consequently, while this paper addresses a general perspective of inclusive playground experience for children with disabilities, there is also a focus on the experiences of children with ASD in playgrounds. As a result, this literature review begins with an introduction to the prevalence of autistic spectrum disorder and its associated characteristics. It presents existing research on play, examining various playground factors that impact the experiences of children with disabilities, including ASD.

Unraveling the brain circuits activated and influenced by MBIs may help us gain better understanding of the therapeutic and educational values of MBIs by gathering strong research evidence. However, the complexity and variety of MBIs impose unique research challenges.

However, the mechanism of action of music or music therapy is not well understood. It is only recently that the neuroendocrinological basis of therapeutic relationships has become the subject of growing research interest. The aim of this pilot study (Clinical Trial No: DRKS00035174) is to investigate whether oxytocin is usable and feasible as a biomarker of attachment to demonstrate the development of therapeutic alliance between therapist and patient in a dyadic music therapy setting. Methods In a single-measure crossover design, children aged 6\u201312\u202fyears from a special school for social and emotional disorders, were randomly with either music therapy followed by a waiting list control group that performed silent work, or vice versa. The respective interventions were conducted on the school premises on different days over a period of 1\u202fmonth. The primary outcome was salivary oxytocin, with tests performed immediately before and after each 30-min intervention. Results Thirty-two children were included in the study, resulting in n\u202f=\u202f16 children per allocation sequence. During the implementation of the study, difficulties were encountered with protocol adherence both in terms of the duration of the music therapy and the implementation of the silent work in the control group. There were no dropouts, however, only 28 children were included in the final data analysis as two participants in each group were excluded due to large fluctuations in oxytocin levels. Between-group comparison and within-group comparisons showed no significant changes in oxytocin levels. However, the music therapist showed a significant increase in oxytocin levels in the before after measurement. No side effects or adverse events were reported during the trial. Conclusion The findings indicated a responsiveness of oxytocin to musical stimulation. Although feasibility of oxytocin measurement was clearly demonstrated, evaluation of the results is difficult against the background of many remaining questions regarding individual and contextual factors influencing the oxytocinergic system.

We presented 3- and 6-month-old infants with pairs of talking faces, one producing non-native ID speech and the other non-native AD speech, either in silence (Experiment 1) or accompanied by non-native ID or AD background speech (Experiment 2). Results from Experiment 1 showed an overall preference for the silent ID talking faces across both age groups, suggesting a reliance on cross-linguistic, potentially universal cues for this preference. However, Experiment 2 showed that preference for ID faces was disrupted at 3\u00a0months when auditory speech was present (ID or AD). At 6\u00a0months, infants maintained a preference for ID talking faces, but only when accompanied by ID speech.

Research suggests that these well\u2010known songs are especially effective at eliciting engaged behaviors from infants in controlled settings, but how infants respond to familiar music with their caregivers in their everyday environment remains unclear. The current study used an online questionnaire to quantify how often and why caregivers present certain songs and musical recordings to their infants. Using a cross\u2010sectional approach, we explored infants' changing behavioral profiles to music from birth to 24 months. Caregivers additionally reported on their feelings of affective attachment toward their infants. Results reveal that caregivers sing and play recorded music for younger and older infants at comparably high rates. In turn, infants actively respond to their favorite songs and recordings by demonstrating positive emotions, movements, and attentive listening. Caregivers mainly consider their infants' musical preferences when building their shared musical repertoire at home.

Stress is a sense of emotional tension caused by several life events. For example, worrying about something, being under pressure, and facing significant challenges are causes of stress. The human body is affected by stress in various ways. It promotes inflammation, which affects cardiac health. The autonomic nervous system is activated during mental stress. Posttraumatic stress disorder and Alzheimer\u2019s disease are common brain stress disorders. Several methods have been used previously to identify stress, for instance, magnetic resonance imaging, single-photon emission computed tomography and EEG. The EEG identifies the electrical activity in the human brain by applying small electrodes positioned on the scalp of the brain. It is a useful non-invasive method and collects feedback from stress hormones. In addition, it can serve as a reliable tool for measuring stress.

Pain sensitization, a key feature of SCI, is commonly assessed via quantitative sensory testing like the Pressure Pain Threshold (PPT), though the factors influencing PPT changes remain unclear. This study hypothesizes that specific clinical and neurophysiological factors modulate PPT in SCI patients. The primary objective is to identify predictors of PPT in SCI patients. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of neurophysiological, clinical, and demographic data from 102 SCI patients in an ongoing prospective cohort study called \u201cDeficit of Inhibition as a Marker of Neuroplasticity\u201d (DEFINE study). Multivariable regression analyses were used to evaluate demographic, clinical, and functional variables associated with PPT, the primary outcome measure. Results: The sample comprised 87.9% males with an average age of 41. Trauma was the leading cause of SCI (77.45%), predominantly affecting the cervical and thoracic levels. Pain was reported by 44% of participants, and the mean PPT was 8.3 kPa, measured bilaterally. Multivariate analysis of PPT in the left, right, and bilateral thenar regions revealed consistent trends. Significant negative associations were found between bilateral PPT and low beta EEG frequency in the central area (\u03b2 = \u221214.94, p = 0.017), traumatic lesion etiology (\u03b2 = \u22121.99, p = 0.038), and incomplete lesions by the American Spinal Injury Association classification (\u03b2 = \u22121.68, p = 0.012). In contrast, positive associations were observed with age (\u03b2 = 0.08, p < 0.001).

In this study, we compare effects of a brief resilience training (RT) and an active control training in diversity management (DMT) on psychobiological stress response to and recovery from an intense military exercise of 81 male officer cadets. Five weeks after training completion, autonomic, endocrine, and subjective state measures of cadets were measured while undergoing stressful military exercise. The RT group perceived the military stressor as more challenging, and showed higher values in motivation and positive affect than the DMT group. Cortisol increased in both groups during stress, but showed a lower cortisol increase in the RT group thereafter.

To examine the level of psychophysical development of cadets who were engaged in orienteering during their training compared to cadets who were engaged in other sports. Tasks: 1) to find out the attitude of cadets to orienteering during their training; 2) to conduct a comparative analysis of the level of development of motor skills in cadets who were engaged in orienteering and cadets who were engaged in other sports. \nMaterials and methods. The research involved 346 male cadets aged 20-22 years. Of these, 32 cadets were engaged in orienteering and 314 cadets were engaged in other sports. Research methods: theoretical analysis and generalization of literary sources and Internet data, questionnaires, testing the level of development of motor skills, and methods of mathematical statistics. The level of psychophysical development was investigated by the results of the following tests: 100 m run, pull-ups, exercise on the combined-arms obstacle course (12 obstacles, 400 m), 3 km run, 5 km accelerated march, 6x100 m shuttle run. \nResults. It was found that more than 95 % of cadets noted that the qualities and skills developed and formed during orienteering training sessions are professionally important for every serviceman. The comparative analysis of the level of development of motor skills in cadets who were engaged in orienteering and other sports showed a positive effect of orienteering on improving the level of cadets\u2019 psychophysical development. The results of the cadets engaged in orienteering were significantly better in most tests, except for the representatives of polyathlon and military pentathlon, where the test exercises are competitive. The most pronounced effect of orienteering training was found on cadets\u2019 endurance. \nConclusions. This suggests that orienteering training has a positive effect on improving the level of cadets\u2019 psychophysical development, which will contribute to the effectiveness of their future professional and combat activities.

In this paper, we address this problem by answering these questions in an accessible way. To this end, we study how researchers can use detrending and differencing to model trends in time series analysis. We show via simulation the consequences of modeling trends inappropriately, and evaluate the performance of one popular approach to distinguish different trend types in empirical data. We present these results in an accessible way, providing an extensive introduction to key concepts in time series analysis, illustrated throughout with simple examples. Finally, we discuss a number of take-home messages and extensions to standard approaches, which directly address more complex time-series analysis problems encountered by empirical researchers.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-01-15", "synthetic_support_claim": "Understanding stationarity is crucial to addressing frequent issues in time series analysis effectively.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Stationarity is irrelevant when analyzing financial time series data."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "7edb5a366acd69411dba1d02fe358972f4a48f08", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7edb5a366acd69411dba1d02fe358972f4a48f08", "title": "Searching for the Metaverse: Neuroscience of Physical and Digital Communities", "abstract": "What distinguishes real-world communities from their online counterparts? Social and cognitive neuroscience research on social networks and collective intentionality will be used in the article to answer this question. Physical communities are born in places.

At the same time, however, the lack of physical co-presence of community members significantly reduces their possibility of activating \u201cwe-mode\u201d cognitive processes and social motivation. Because of this, unlike physical communities that allow interaction between people from varied origins and stories, digital communities are always made up of people who have the same interests and knowledge (communities of practice). This new situation disrupts the \u201cwisdom of crowd,\u201d making the community more radical and less accurate (polarization effect), allowing influential users to wield disproportionate influence over the group's beliefs, and producing inequalities in the distribution of social capital. However, a new emergent technology\u2014the Metaverse\u2014has the potential to reverse this trend.

Firstly, this study investigated how demographic factors (e.g., age, gender, education) influence e-customer preferences in Serbia. From a sample of n = 906 respondents, conditional dependencies between demographics and user preferences were tested. From a hypothetical framework of 24 tested hypotheses, this study successfully rejected 8/24 (with p < 0.05), suggesting a high association between demographics with purchase frequency and reasons for quitting the purchase.

Therefore, the second part of this study considers an MCA-HCPC (Multiple Correspondence Analysis with Hierarchical Clustering on Principal Components) to identify user profiles. The analysis revealed three main clusters: (1) young, female, unemployed e-customers driven mainly by customer reviews; (2) retirees and older adults with infrequent purchases, hesitant to buy without experiencing the product in person; and (3) employed, highly educated, male, middle-aged adults who prioritize fast and accurate delivery over price.

There is uncertainty on the clinical manifestations of LC. We undertook a systematic review to summarize the available evidence about the main psychiatric manifestations of LC. Method PubMed (Medline), Scopus, CINHAL, PsycINFO, and EMBASE were searched until May 2022. Studies reporting estimation of emerging psychiatric symptoms and/or psychiatric diagnoses among adult people with LC were included. Pooled prevalence for each psychiatric condition was calculated in absence of control groups to compare with. Results Thirty-three reports were included in the final selection, corresponding to 282,711 participants with LC. After 4 weeks from COVID-19 infection recovery, participants reported the following psychiatric symptoms: depression, anxiety, post-traumatic symptoms (PTS), cognitive and sleeping disturbances (i.e., insomnia or hypersomnia). The most common psychiatric manifestation resulted to be sleep disturbances, followed by depression, PTS, anxiety, and cognitive impairment (i.e., attention and memory deficits).

Limited research has been dedicated to exploring neuroimaging markers of intelligence specifically in the pediatric population. In this study, we utilized resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and intelligence quotient (IQ) scores of 170 healthy children and adolescents obtained from a public database to identify brain functional connectivity markers associated with individual intellectual behavior. Initially, we extracted and summarized relevant resting-state features from whole-brain or functional network connectivity that were most pertinent to IQ scores.

Recently, structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging techniques allowed for the detection of increased grey matter volumes for specific brain regions and substantial modifications in the default mode, frontoparietal, and dorsal attention networks following exercise. Here, we highlighted that physical activity induced significant changes in functional brain activation and cognitive performance in every age group and could counteract psychological disorders and neural decline. No particular age group gained better benefits from exercise, and a specific exercise type could generate better cognitive improvements for a selected target subject. Further research should develop appropriate intervention programs concerning age and comorbidity to achieve the most significant cognitive outcomes.", "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-06-01", "synthetic_support_claim": "Physical activity induces significant changes in functional brain activation and cognitive performance in every age group.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Exercise significantly improves sleep quality in individuals of all age groups."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "e292a9bc1083f93b1624adcab76afef3d594c547", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e292a9bc1083f93b1624adcab76afef3d594c547", "title": "Addressing mental health challenges in college students: A biomechanical approach to mitigating stress and cognitive load through physical intervention strategies", "abstract": "The main objective of this investigation is to find out how biomechanical actions, such as physical activity programs, balanced adjustments, and mindfulness-based posture correction, are successful at reducing Cognitive Load (CL) and levels of stress among college students.

We choose basketball as a method for sustainable education because it is a sport with diverse technical procedures and tactical actions anda game that plays a significant role in cognitive functional development. This study aims to modernize physical education and sports education to meet current trends and needs. A modern approach to lessons can contribute to the mental and motor development of young people, forming individuals who value movement for health and physical well-being. Thus, integrating VR into physical education lessons (using the means of basketball) represents a paradigm shift in how students prepare and improve their motor function. The study focuses on non-specialized higher education, combining the cognitive benefits of sports with sustainable practices, as we found his to be a gap in our literature review. The experimental program used Raven\u2019s Progressive Matrices, a cognitive ability test, to measure general intelligence. The data were collected on two groups of children (control and experimental, at the beginning of the experiment and after 39 lessons of 100 min each). The t Test results applied in SPSS showed a significant increase in average scores for Raven\u2019s Progressive Matrices after performing the motor program using basketball-specific means, especially for the experimental group.

Background Nurses in infectious disease departments play a critical role in the prevention and control of infectious diseases and in public health care services in general, and their quality of life can affect the quality of clinical nursing work they do. However, there are few studies on the relationship between nurses' social support networks and their quality of life. Methods A cross\u2010sectional study was conducted using a sample of 866 clinical nurses from the infectious disease departments of 10 general hospitals in China. Data were collected using a questionnaire survey from January to May 2021. The mediating influence of psychological resilience on social support and quality of life was investigated using structural equation modelling. Results The score of quality of life was (36.36\u2009\u00b1\u20097.64). Quality of life was positively correlated with social support and psychological resilience (r 1\u2009=\u20090.521, r 2\u2009=\u20090.583; p\u2009<\u2009.01), and psychological resilience was positively correlated with social support (r\u2009=\u20090.426; p\u2009<\u2009.01) as well. The mediating effect of psychological resilience between social support and quality of life was 0.233, accounting for 37% of the total effect. Conclusion The quality of life of nurses working in infectious disease departments is in the middle level. Psychological resilience is a mediating variable between social support and quality of life. Implications for Nursing Management Managers can improve the quality of life of nurses by both increasing social support and strengthening psychological resilience. Managers should pay attention to the degree of social support provided to nurses and take proactive measures to build psychological resilience so that nurses can effectively manage stress and negative emotions from work and life in order improve their quality of life.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-11-01", "synthetic_support_claim": "Psychological resilience mediates the relationship between social support and quality of life for nurses.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Nurses in infectious disease departments have higher quality of life than nurses in other departments."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "87f7b66f61aa6d8f4158bf84533939951dd1b062", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/87f7b66f61aa6d8f4158bf84533939951dd1b062", "title": "Risk perception and quality of working life of nurses in infectious disease department in China: The chain\u2010mediating effects of psychological resilience and social support", "abstract": "Abstract Aim To determine whether social support and psychological resiliency are significant mediators of the associations between risk perception and quality of working life in Chinese nurses working with infectious diseases.

Reviewing a large number of psychophysical and computational explorations of core object recognition performance in humans and DNNs, we argue that DNNs are highly valuable scientific tools but that, as of today, DNNs should only be regarded as promising-but not yet adequate-computational models of human core object recognition behavior.

Although early detection is crucial, it remains logistically challenging at the same time. While traditional pen-and-paper tests require in-depth training to ensure standardized administration and accurate interpretation of findings, significant technological advancements are leading to the development of procedures for the early detection of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) and facilitating the diagnostic process. Some of the diagnostic protocols, however, show significant limitations that hamper their widespread adoption. Concerns about the social and economic implications of the increasing incidence of AD underline the need for reliable, non-invasive, cost-effective, and timely cognitive scoring methodologies. For instance, modern clinical studies report significant oculomotor impairments among patients with MCI, who perform poorly in visual paired-comparison tasks by ascribing less attentional resources to novel stimuli. To accelerate the Global Action Plan on the Public Health Response to Dementia 2017\u20132025, this work provides an overview of research on saccadic and exploratory eye-movement deficits among older adults with MCI. The review protocol was drafted based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Electronic databases were systematically searched to identify peer-reviewed articles published between 2017 and 2022 that examined visual processing in older adults with MCI and reported gaze parameters as potential biomarkers. Moreover, following the contemporary trend for remote healthcare technologies, we reviewed studies that implemented non-commercial eye-tracking instrumentation in order to detect information processing impairments among the MCI population. Based on the gathered literature, eye-tracking-based paradigms may ameliorate the screening limitations of traditional cognitive assessments and contribute to early AD detection.

However, the characteristics of abnormal eye movements of patients with AD and their relationship with clinical symptoms remain inconsistent, and their predictive value for diagnosing and monitoring the progression of AD remains unclear. Methods A total of 42 normal controls, 63 patients with mild cognitive impairment due to AD (AD-MCI), and 49 patients with dementia due to AD (AD-D) were recruited. Eye movements were assessed using the EyeKnow eye-tracking and analysis system. Cognitive function, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and activities of daily living were evaluated using various rating scales, and correlation analyses and receiver operating characteristic curves were performed. Results Patients with AD exhibited increased number of offsets and offset degrees, prolonged offset duration, and decreased accuracy in lateral fixation; reduced accuracy, prolonged saccadic duration, and decreased velocity in prosaccade; decreased accuracy and corrected rate, prolonged corrected antisaccadic duration, and reduced velocity in antisaccade; and reduced accuracy and increased inhibition failures in memory saccade. Eye movement parameters were correlated with global cognition and the cognitive domains of memory, language, attention, visuospatial ability, execution function, and activities of daily living. Subgroup analysis indicated that the associations between eye movements and clinical symptoms in patients with AD were influenced by disease severity and history of diabetes. In the AD-D and AD with diabetes groups, these associations diminished. Nevertheless, the associations persisted in the AD-MCI and AD without diabetes groups. The areas under the curves for predicting AD, AD-MCI, and AD-D were 0.835, 0.737, and 0.899, respectively (all p\u2009<\u20090.05).

Sex differences have largely been under reported or ignored in neurological research. However, eye movement features provide biomarkers that are useful for disease classification with superior accuracy and robustness compared to previous classifiers for neurological diseases. Neurological diseases have a sex specificity, yet eye movement analysis has not been specific to our understanding of sex differences. Methods: The study involved subjects recruited from 804 sites equipped with RightEye Vision Systems, primarily located in optometry practices across the United States. Subjects completed six eye movement assessments: circular smooth pursuit (CSP), horizontal smooth pursuit (HSP), vertical smooth pursuit (VSP), horizontal saccades (HS), vertical saccades (VS), and fixation stability (FS). Eye movements were analyzed and classified in accordance with age and sex by multiple t-tests and linear regression models. Results: This study represented a large sample size of 23,557 subjects, with 11,871 males and 11,686 females representing ages from birth through 80 years of age. We observed statistically significant differences for all eye movement functions between males and females. Conclusions: We demonstrate that eye movements are sex-specific and offer normative data to compare sex-specific eye movement function by age.

Digital tools are often viewed as a solution to bridge this divide and to increase supports for families. There is, however, a paucity of research that has evaluated digital health tools, their potential benefits for child neurodevelopment and associated concerns (eg, mental health, well-being), and their benefit for families. Objective This study conducted the first review of existing mobile apps and digital resources targeted at supporting the needs of children with developmental concerns or neurodevelopmental conditions. Methods We identified 3435 separate resources, of which 112 (43 apps and 69 digital resources) met the criteria. These resources were categorized according to their purpose or target and were then reviewed based on their engagement, information quality, and evidence base using the Adapted Mobile App Rating Scale. Results The most common condition of concern targeted by apps and digital resources was autism (19/112, 17% resources), with retrieved resources focusing on supporting challenging behaviors, promoting speech, language, and social development, and providing options for alternative and assistive communication. Other common areas of concern targeted by apps and digital resources included language and communication (16/112, 14.3%) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (11/112, 9.8%). Results showed that reviewed resources were engaging, with high levels of accessibility and functionality. Resources had various functions, including developmental or behavioral tasks targeted at children, assistive communication support, scheduling support, journaling, and advice, activities, and strategies for parents. The information quality of resources, such as credibility of source and evidence base was, however, mostly low. Apps and digital resources with good credibility and an existing evidence base were largely developed in partnership with research, health, or government institutions, and were rated significantly higher on overall quality compared with apps and digital resources not developed in partnership with such institutions (apps; t41=\u20134.35, P<.001; digital resources; t67=\u20134.95, P<.001). Conclusions The lack of evidence base across resources means that it is extremely difficult to provide recommendations to families with respect to apps or digital resources that may support their needs. Frameworks for the development of new tools are discussed, highlighting the novel approaches required to demonstrate the efficacy of tools for improving outcomes for children and families.

Objective This study aimed to investigate the correlation of influencing factors and mental health symptoms among Chinese college students according to two rounds of surveys during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and methods This study was divided into two stages of cross-sectional investigation. In February 2020 and May 2020, two cross-sectional surveys were conducted on college students in the above areas by means of cluster sampling. From February 4 to February 12, 2020, 14,789 college students completed the first round of online study from 16 cities and universities in 21 in China, excluding participants who completed the questionnaire, and finally included 11,787 college students. After 3 months, we also conducted a large-scale questionnaire survey based on the first study area to observe the behavioral changes and psychological symptoms of college students within 3 months. Using the convenience sampling method, a survey on the cognitive and psychological status of COVID-19 among college students was conducted in 21 universities in 16 regions in May 2020. The regions among the two surveys are divided into Wuhan (District 1), neighboring Hubei (District 2), first-tier cities, namely, Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou (District 3), and other provinces (District 4). Results (1) In the first survey, the average age of the participants was 20.51 \u00b1 1.88 years. One-third of the college students were male. In total, 25.9 and 17.8% of college students reported depression and anxiety symptoms, respectively. College students, who reported higher ST, lower PA, higher soda beverage and tea beverage intake, have Chinese herbal medicine and vitamin drinking, and decreased frequency of diet had higher depression and anxiety symptoms. Moreover, infection risk, perceived resistance to COVID-19, concerns about physical symptoms, family/friends directly/indirectly contacted with confirmed cases, and seeking psychological counseling had significant associations with anxiety and depression symptoms. (2) In the second round of surveys, 6803 males (41.7%) and 9502 females (58.3%) had a mean age of 20.58 \u00b1 1.81 years. The prevalence of depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms during COVID-19 was 30.7 and 23.9%, respectively. (3) In both surveys, college students who reported having higher ST, lower PA, higher soda beverage and tea beverage intake, Chinese herbal medicine and vitamin drinking, and decreased frequency of diet also had higher depression and anxiety symptoms. Coping styles with COVID-19 partially mediate the association between some related lifestyle behaviors and anxiety and depression. The results of the conditional process model analysis support our hypothesis that lifestyle behaviors, and coping styles are both predictors of anxiety and depression symptoms, with both direct and indirect effects moderated by gender level. In logistic regression analysis, the correlation of depression and anxiety in the second rounds of the survey was higher than that in the first survey. In two surveys, there was a correlation between lifestyle health behaviors and coping style, gender and mental health. Conclusions Our findings demonstrated that the prevalence of anxiety and depression in the two rounds of surveys was different, and the prevalence in the second round was higher than that in the first round, as well as that in the two rounds of surveys. All survey identified that unhealthy lifestyle behaviors were positively associated with depression and anxiety symptoms. Compared with the emerged city of risk areas, other pandemic regions have a lower risk of mental health problems. The survey findings complement each other. Lifestyle health behaviors and coping style alleviated mental health symptoms. COVID-19-related social stressors were positively associated with mental health symptoms. The study also suggests that at the beginning of the pandemic, the effective management of college students' mental health problems, corresponding coping measures and maintaining a good lifestyle play a key role in the prevention and control of other cities.

Prior to the pandemic, depression and anxiety were already on the rise among college students, but the changes associated with it may have exacerbated these issues. Our study aimed to explore factors influencing college students\u2019 mental health and identify common trends in their experiences that could assist organizations and policymakers in the future. Methods The study participants (n = 571) were chosen using a convenience sample of undergraduate and graduate students attending a Central Texas university. We employed the Qualtrics survey platform to collect data on multiple demographic variables, behavioral health, and other health outcomes of students in the summer semester of 2021. Our objective in this study was to investigate the various factors that contribute to mental health conditions, particularly anxiety, and depression, independently and jointly, by employing two validated tools - Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), which measures depression, and General Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7), which measures anxiety. Results Both the tools displayed satisfactory internal consistency, with Cronbach\u2019s alpha coefficients (\u03b1) of 0.921 for the PHQ-9 (9-item) scale and 0.943 for the GAD-7 (7-item) scale. The prevalence of depression and anxiety among participants was 39.4% and 40.1%, respectively, with 31% of participants overall reporting both conditions. Among the explored factors, age, race, parent/guardian\u2019s level of education, campus residence status, and health insurance status were associated with depression (p < 0.05), whereas gender, age, race, and parent/guardian\u2019s level of education were associated with anxiety (p < 0.05). Academically, several factors related to learning difficulties (i.e., staying motivated to learn, finding a quiet place to learn) were associated with the severity of depression and anxiety severity, demonstrated through composite scores.

We conducted 42 key informant interviews with students diagnosed with mental disorders, as determined by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Interviews were guided by a structured protocol developed by the research team, and all participants provided informed consent. The interviews were audiotaped, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using thematic analysis. This approach was chosen for its efficiency and directness.

We aim to assess the inter-relationships of depression, burnout, and anxiety symptoms with dropout intention among Chinese medical undergraduates using the network analysis. Method: A total of 3,648 Chinese medical undergraduates were recruited through snowball sampling. Learning burnout scale, 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and General Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) was used to assess burnout, depression, and anxiety symptoms, respectively. We used the EBICglasso model to estimate the network. We compared the network based on gender, study phase, and clinical experience. Results: After removing repeated submissions and incorrect responses to the trap question, 3,536 participants were included in the final analysis. The prevalence of burnout, depression, anxiety, and dropout intention was 38, 62.7, 38.4, and 39% respectively, which is consistent with previous findings. Network analysis suggested that anxiety and depression items clustered together and displayed several strong bridge connections, while burnout items formed another cluster. All the strongest edges were within the respective distress. Cynicism symptoms \u2018I am fed up with study\u2019 and \u2018I want to study but I feel that studying is boring\u2019 were the most central symptoms, while \u2018fatigue\u2019 and \u2018worthless\u2019 were the bridge symptoms within the burnout-depression-anxiety network.

This study aims to investigate the symptom network of stress, burnout, anxiety, depression (SBAD) and adverse personal outcomes in this cohort. Methods From October 2020 to April 2022, 994 physicians were recruited across China through snowball sampling. Stress, burnout, anxiety and depression were assessed using the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale, a two-item burnout questionnaire, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, respectively. Data on adverse personal outcomes (low quality of life [QOL] and suicidal ideation) were collected. We constructed and visualized two networks, calculating expected influence (EI) and bridge EI indices to identify central and bridge symptoms. Results In the SBAD network, perceived helplessness was the most central and critical bridge symptom connecting stress and mental distress, with emotional exhaustion identified as the secondary bridge symptom. Perceived helplessness, perceived self-efficacy and emotional exhaustion exhibited the highest negative correlations with QOL. Worthless (PHQ6) and motor (PHQ8) symptoms were strongly correlated with suicidal ideation. The estimated SBAD network showed excellent stability and accuracy.

Studies have found that depression and anxiety have a negative impact on the mental health domain of burnout in healthcare workers. However, little is known about the symptom-to-symptom interactions between these psychological outcomes. This study aims to elucidate the characteristics of depression, anxiety, and burnout networks among healthcare workers. Methods We recruited 846 healthcare workers from March to April 2023 from three hospitals. A total of 826 healthcare workers completed the General Information Scale, the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology\u2013Self-Report (QIDS-SR16), the Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and the Burnout Clinical Subtype Questionnaire (BCSQ)-36. The network models were constructed using network analysis. The expected influence and the bridge expected influence of nodes were calculated. The stability and accuracy of the network was assessed. Results The results showed that the core symptoms in the symptom network mainly included QIDS8 (Energy/Fatigability), SAS3 (Easily upset or frightened), SAS11 (Dizzy), SAS8 (Tiredness), SAS10 (Tachycardia) and BCSQ3 (Worn-out), and the key nodes connecting these symptoms were QIDS2 (Sad mood), SAS20 (Have nightmares), BCSQ3 (Worn-out), SAS8 (Tiredness), QIDS8 (Energy/Fatigability), QIDS4 (Concentration/decision-making) and SAS4 (Madness). Conclusion Unique pathways of association between burnout, depression, and anxiety were found to exist.

Epistemic trust (openness to interpersonally transmitted information) has been associated with mentalizing. Balanced mentalizing abilities allow people to cope with external and internal stressors. Studies show that social isolation imposed by the COVID\u201019 pandemic was highly stressful for most people, especially for adolescents. Here we examine whether mentalizing and epistemic trust were protective factors in relation to emotional distress during the lockdown. Method A total of 131 nonclinical adolescents, aged between 12 and 18 years, were evaluated during the lockdown using the Reflective Functioning Questionnaire for Youth, Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment, Perceived Stress Scale, and Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale. Results Results from network analysis showed that epistemic trust and mentalizing were negatively associated with perceived stress and emotion dysregulation. Epistemic trust in fathers was associated with level of perceived stress, and epistemic trust in mothers with emotion dysregulation. Conclusion These findings suggest that epistemic trust and the capacity to mentalize were low in adolescents during lockdown, and this was associated with high levels of stress.

The model then combines these inferred mental contents with the event to compute \u2018appraisals\u2019: whether the situation conformed to the expectations and fulfilled the preferences. We learn functions mapping computed appraisals to emotion labels, allowing the model to match human observers\u2019 quantitative predictions of 20 emotions, including joy, relief, guilt and envy. Model comparison indicates that inferred monetary preferences are not sufficient to explain observers\u2019 emotion predictions; inferred social preferences are factored into predictions for nearly every emotion. Human observers and the model both use minimal individualizing information to adjust predictions of how different people will respond to the same event.

We therefore might expect numerous proposals for organizing human moral cognition around the logic of bargaining, negotiation, and agreement. Yet, while \"contractualist\" ideas play an important role in moral philosophy, they are starkly underrepresented in the field of moral psychology. From a contractualist perspective, ideal moral judgments are those that would be agreed to by rational bargaining agents-an idea with wide-spread support in philosophy, psychology, economics, biology, and cultural evolution. As a practical matter, however, investing time and effort in negotiating every interpersonal interaction is unfeasible. Instead, we propose, people use abstractions and heuristics to efficiently identify mutually beneficial arrangements. We argue that many well-studied elements of our moral minds, such as reasoning about others' utilities (\"consequentialist\" reasoning) or evaluating intrinsic ethical properties of certain actions (\"deontological\" reasoning), can be naturally understood as resource-rational approximations of a contractualist ideal. Moreover, this view explains the flexibility of our moral minds-how our moral rules and standards get created, updated and overridden and how we deal with novel cases we have never seen before. Thus, the apparently fragmentary nature of our moral psychology-commonly described in terms of systems in conflict-can be largely unified around the principle of finding mutually beneficial agreements under resource constraint.

Avatar Interventions are dialogic and experiential treatments integrating personalized medicine with virtual reality (VR), which have shown promising results by enhancing the emotional regulation of their participants. Notably, Avatar Therapy for the treatment of auditory hallucinations (i.e., voices) allows patients to engage in dialogue with an avatar representing their most persecutory voice. In addition, Avatar Intervention for cannabis use disorder involves an avatar representing a significant person in the patient\u2019s consumption. In both cases, the main goal is to modify the problematic relationship and allow patients to regain control over their symptoms. While results are promising, its potential to be applied to other psychopathologies, such as major depression, is an exciting area for further exploration. In an era where VR interventions are gaining popularity, the present study aims to investigate whether technological advancements could overcome current limitations, such as avatar realism, and foster a deeper immersion into virtual environments, thereby enhancing participants\u2019 sense of presence within the virtual world. A newly developed virtual reality platform was compared to the current platform used by our research team in past and ongoing studies. Methods: This study involved 43 subjects: 20 healthy subjects and 23 subjects diagnosed with severe mental disorders. Each participant interacted with an avatar using both platforms. After each immersive session, questionnaires were administered by a graduate student in a double-blind manner to evaluate technological advancements and user experiences. Results: The findings indicate that the new technological improvements allow the new platform to significantly surpass the current platform as per multiple subjective parameters. Notably, the new platform was associated with superior realism of the avatar (d = 0.574; p < 0.001) and the voice (d = 1.035; p < 0.001), as well as enhanced lip synchronization (d = 0.693; p < 0.001). Participants reported a significantly heightened sense of presence (d = 0.520; p = 0.002) and an overall better immersive experience (d = 0.756; p < 0.001) with the new VR platform.

Autistic masking also may include unconscious or conscious attempts to mimic the behavioral, cognitive, or sensory styles of nonautistic neurotypical people and to suppress natural forms of autistic behavior, cognition, and reactions to sensory experiences. Since autistic people are a stigmatized minority in many neurotypical dominated societies, passing as nonautistic through autistic masking may be an attempt to avoid autism stigma and a reaction to previous interpersonal trauma.

However, researchers have rarely explored whether how parents raise their children (called 'parenting practices') links to parenting stress and child behaviours. This is important, as if we know which parenting practices lead to better outcomes, parents can be supported to use parenting practices that are most helpful to them and/or their child. We asked parents of school-aged children to complete a survey on parenting stress, parenting practices and child behaviours. We found that parents who reported being more stressed (i.e. high levels of parenting stress) reported their children showed more observable behaviours that others find challenging such as aggression. Parents who were more stressed also reported lower mindful parenting (i.e. a style of parenting characterised by being present, non-judgementally in the moment) and were more permissive (e.g. giving in) in their parenting. However, these parenting practices did not impact the link between parenting stress and child behaviours.

Previous research has demonstrated the clinical efficacy of electroacupuncture (EA) in mitigating neuropathic pain and its associated mood disorders. Recent studies have underscored a correlation between gut microbiota and both NP and negative emotional states. Nevertheless, the relationship between the modulation of gut microbiota by EA and the amelioration of NP remains inadequately understood. Methods Mice were randomly assigned to one of the three groups: the Control (Con) group, the EA group, and the Chronic Constrictive Injury (CCI) group (n = 12 each).

To investigate the impact of gut microbiota on CCI mice, we employed a variety of methods, including various behavioral tests and 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequencing. Results The results indicated that EA significantly ameliorated mechanical allodynia and emotional dysfunction induced by CCI in mice.

To test this hypothesis, we invited 35 Korean American older adults to interact with Hyodol SAR over a four-month period. This extended engagement allowed us to investigate the underlying factors and dimensions shaping users\u2019 perceptions and experiences. We assessed perceptions through measures of robotic attitudes and usability, while user experiences were evaluated using overall assessment questions and behavioral indicators, such as instances where participants showed the robot to others. We conducted a comparative analysis between participants who chose to keep the robot (\u201cKeepers\u201d) and those who opted to return it (\u201cReturners\u201d), providing insights into how each group utilized and interpreted the robots. Additionally, we examined the reasons Returners decided to not to retain the robot, aiming to identify barriers to acceptance and engagement. Our results indicated that participants\u2019 experiences of warmth and competence while interacting with the Hyodol robots did not significantly differ between the Keepers and Returners. However, distinct patterns emerged in their utilization and interpretation of the robot; the 24 Keepers demonstrated a more intimate level of engagement compared to the 11 Returners. In an era characterized by the growing integration of AI in human care, our findings suggest that social presence became valuable concepts for developing robot companions to enhance their effectiveness.", "publicationTypes": ["Study", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-11-18", "synthetic_support_claim": "Social presence of Hyodol robots may facilitate technology use among Korean American older adults.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "\"The Hyodol robot significantly improves overall mental health among older Korean American adults.\""}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "953ed592bfe39f0eb836610fc1956be880422188", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/953ed592bfe39f0eb836610fc1956be880422188", "title": "Social Robots as Social Proxies for Fostering Connection and Empathy Towards Humanity", "abstract": "Despite living in an increasingly connected world, social isolation is a prevalent issue today.

However, real-world chat data remain proprietary and unexplored despite their growing popularity, and new analyses of chatbot uses and their effects on mitigating negative moods are urgently needed. Objective In this study, we investigated whether and how artificial intelligence chatbots facilitate the expression of user emotions, specifically sadness and depression. We also examined cultural differences in the expression of depressive moods among users in Western and Eastern countries. Methods This study used SimSimi, a global open-domain social chatbot, to analyze 152,783 conversation utterances containing the terms \u201cdepress\u201d and \u201csad\u201d in 3 Western countries (Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and 5 Eastern countries (Indonesia, India, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand). Study 1 reports new findings on the cultural differences in how people talk about depression and sadness to chatbots based on Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count and n-gram analyses. In study 2, we classified chat conversations into predefined topics using semisupervised classification techniques to better understand the types of depressive moods prevalent in chats. We then identified the distinguishing features of chat-based depressive discourse data and the disparity between Eastern and Western users. Results Our data revealed intriguing cultural differences. Chatbot users in Eastern countries indicated stronger emotions about depression than users in Western countries (positive: P<.001; negative: P=.01); for example, Eastern users used more words associated with sadness (P=.01). However, Western users were more likely to share vulnerable topics such as mental health (P<.001), and this group also had a greater tendency to discuss sensitive topics such as swear words (P<.001) and death (P<.001). In addition, when talking to chatbots, people expressed their depressive moods differently than on other platforms. Users were more open to expressing emotional vulnerability related to depressive or sad moods to chatbots (74,045/148,590, 49.83%) than on social media (149/1978, 7.53%). Chatbot conversations tended not to broach topics that require social support from others, such as seeking advice on daily life difficulties, unlike on social media. However, chatbot users acted in anticipation of conversational agents that exhibit active listening skills and foster a safe space where they can openly share emotional states such as sadness or depression. Conclusions The findings highlight the potential of chatbot-assisted mental health support, emphasizing the importance of continued technical and policy-wise efforts to improve chatbot interactions for those in need of emotional assistance.

Methods In this paper, we study the ethical dimensions of integrating these technologies in chatbots for depression intervention using the digital ethics canvas and the DTx Risk Assessment Canvas. Results As result, we identified some specific risks associated with the integration of sentiment and emotion analysis methods into these systems related to the difficulty to recognize correctly the expressed sentiment or emotion from statements of individuals with depressive symptoms and the appropriate system reaction including risk detection. Depending on the realization of the sentiment or emotion analysis, which might be dictionary-based or machine-learning based, additional risks occur from biased training data or misinterpretations. Discussion While technology decisions during system development can be made carefully depending on the use case, other ethical risks cannot be prevented on a technical level, but by carefully integrating such chatbots into the care process allowing for supervision by health professionals.

While research has shown that parents' and autistic child's demographics and behavioral characteristics are associated with psychological distress among caregivers of children with autism, very few studies have investigated the impact of the caregiver's unmet needs on various aspects of the perceived family burden. Methods This cross-sectional study examined the prevalence of stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms among a wide range of 146 parents with different sociodemographic characteristics, social support and unmet needs who care for children with autism spectrum disorder. These parents were recruited from autism non-governmental organizations and the National Children's Rehabilitation Center in Astana, Kazakhstan, a post-Soviet country in Central Asia. Multiple linear regression analyses were utilized to examine the relationship of parental psychological distress variables with social support, unmet needs and parental and child sociodemographic characteristics. Results Significantly higher levels of stress and depression were reported among parents who perceived their needs as being unmet or extremely unmet as addressed by societal acceptance as compared to parents who reported adequate levels of needs met by social acceptance.

It is well-documented that parents of children with ASD often experience psychiatric conditions like anxiety and depression. Nevertheless, research on the perception of internalized stigma, family functioning, and their interconnections is scarce. The main objective of our study was to analyze the internalized stigma perceptions, depression, anxiety, and family functioning among parents or caregivers of children diagnosed with ASD. Methods This study was conducted on 102 cases and 101 healthy controls in a cross-sectional case-control study involving patients aged 3-12 years. The research was carried out at the Child Psychiatry Clinic of Adana City Training and Research Hospital and three Family Health Centers in Adana from October 15 to December 15, 2022. Sociodemographic data, family history, families' knowledge levels about autism, and information about their social lives were collected using a face-to-face structured questionnaire. The Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness (ISMI), Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD), and Family APGAR scales were administered. Results The mean ISMI score of the case group was 67.31\u00b18.91. According to the HAD Anxiety scale score, 60.8% of the case group and 14.9% of the control group were at high risk (p<0.001). According to the HAD Depression Scale, 52% of the case group participants and 25.7% of the control group were at high risk (p<0.001). The rate of severe familial dysfunction was 18.6% in the case group and 3.0% in the control group (p<0.001).

The flaws of questionnaires providing raw scores are well known. Scores only approximate objective, linear measures. The Rasch Analysis allows you to turn raw scores into measures with an error estimate, satisfying fundamental measurement axioms (e.g., unidimensionality, linearity, generalizability). A previous companion article illustrated the most frequent graphic and numeric representations of results obtained through Rasch Analysis. A more advanced description of the method is presented here. Conclusions: Measures obtained through Rasch Analysis may foster the advancement of the scientific assessment of behaviours, perceptions, skills, attitudes, and knowledge so frequently faced in Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine, not less than in social and educational sciences. Furthermore, suggestions are given on interpreting and managing the inevitable discrepancies between observed scores and ideal measures (data-model \u201cmisfit\u201d). Finally, twelve practical take-home messages for appraising published results are provided.

It can cause fragmented sleep, daytime symptoms, and decreased quality of life. Pharmacological treatment can suppress symptoms, but not cure. When challenged with illness, people may turn to their inner psychological resources such as self-esteem and mastery. The Pearlin Mastery scale was developed to study stress and coping, is commonly used in people with chronic illnesses, however, not yet validated in people with RLS. Aim The aim was to test reliability and construct validity of the Pearlin Mastery Scale in persons with RLS. Methods A cross-sectional postal survey including the Pearlin Mastery Scale, Restless Legs Syndrome-6 Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Patient Health Questionnaire was sent out to members (n = 1500) of the national RLS association and 788 (52.5%) agreed to participate. Data were analyzed using classical test theory, Confirmatory factor analysis and Rasch measurement theory analysis. Hypothesis testing for construct validity was done by bivariate correlation analyses. Results Most respondents were women (65%), retired (71%) and had a mean-age of 70.8 years (SD 11.4). The 7-item version of the Pearlin Mastery Scale showed poor fit to the one factor model. After omitting the two positively worded items (i.e., item 4 and 6), the 5-item version was found to be unidimensional, with satisfactory internal consistency. However, all items showed considerable ceiling effects. No measurement variance was seen regarding age-groups or sex. Higher level of mastery was moderately correlated with less depressive symptoms but only weakly correlated to RLS-related sleep problems.

Methods We surveyed 478 Chinese community-dwelling older adults from November 2022 to May 2023. The Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ), and Brief Aging Perceptions Questionnaire (B-APQ) were used. Correlation analyses, multiple linear regression analysis, and structural equation modeling were performed. Results The average age of participants was 71.52 \u00b1 7.80 years, and the number of chronic diseases was distributed as follows: 270 (56.49%) had 2 disease conditions, 156 (32.64%) had 3 disease conditions, and 52 (10.88%) had 4 disease conditions or more. Scores for alexithymia 57.83 \u00b1 10.19; maladaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies 49.63 \u00b1 10.65; and self-perceived aging 58.74 \u00b1 10.23. Alexithymia and maladaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies were positively correlated with negative self-perceived aging (r=0.665 and r=0.673, respectively), explaining 51.8% of the variance in self-perceived aging. Structural equation modeling results showed that alexithymia had a direct effect (of 0.368) on self-perceived aging, accounting for 44.1% of the total effect. Maladaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies partially mediated the relationship, with a mediation effect of 0.386, accounting for 51.8% of the total effect.

Even though several effective psychological treatments, including cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), have been tested in recent years, there is a lack of comprehensive reviews on their efficacy. The objectives of this systematic review were to explore and synthesize findings from recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) about psychological treatments, with the following inclusion criteria: (1) published from 2010 to 2024; (2) full text being available in English; (3) peer-reviewed journals; and (4) baselines and outcomes measured by TAS-20 and raw data were provided. We excluded non-psychological studies and studies involving mindfulness and DBT. We searched electronic databases (PubMed, PsycInfo, and Google Scholar) and found 18 RCTs and 21 arms for alexithymia, with a combined total of 1251 participants. Fourteen arms (67%) investigated the effect of CBT on alexithymia, including acceptance and commitment therapy (seven arms), behavioral activation therapy (two arms), schema therapy, and compassion-focused therapy. The results indicated that most psychological interventions significantly decreased TAS-20, illustrating a showcase of treatments from each trial with different effect sizes (within-intervention group, ranging from 0.41 to 13.25). However, due to the heterogeneity between the studies, this review study may not be conclusive enough to make each intervention standardized.

In contrast, intrusive mothering is characterized by overstimulation and social interactions guided by the maternal agenda rather than the infant\u2019s interactive cues. These two maternal behavioral styles have been extensively studied and repeatedly shown to predict positive and negative social-emotional outcomes, respectively. Here we show that these two styles, sensitivity and intrusiveness, are differentially related to mechanisms of mother\u2013infant brain-to-brain synchrony; while sensitivity is linked with higher mother\u2013infant neural synchrony, intrusiveness is associated with diminished inter-brain coordination. We believe that the enhancement or limitation on coordinated interactive inputs to the infant\u2019s social brain during its maturational period may be one mechanism by which maternal sensitivity and intrusiveness exert their differential long-term effects on children\u2019s brains and behaviors. Abstract Biobehavioral synchrony, the coordination of physiological and behavioral signals between mother and infant during social contact, tunes the child\u2019s brain to the social world. Probing this mechanism from a two-brain perspective, we examine the associations between patterns of mother\u2013infant inter-brain synchrony and the two well-studied maternal behavioral orientations\u2014sensitivity and intrusiveness\u2014which have repeatedly been shown to predict positive and negative socio-emotional outcomes, respectively. Using dual-electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings, we measure inter-brain connectivity between 60 mothers and their 5- to 12-month-old infants during face-to-face interaction. Thirty inter-brain connections show significantly higher correlations during the real mother\u2013infant face-to-face interaction compared to surrogate data. Brain\u2013behavior correlations indicate that higher maternal sensitivity linked with greater mother\u2013infant neural synchrony, whereas higher maternal intrusiveness is associated with lower inter-brain coordination. Post hoc analysis reveals that the mother-right-frontal\u2013infant-left-temporal connection is particularly sensitive to the mother\u2019s sensitive style, while the mother-left-frontal\u2013infant-right-temporal connection indexes the intrusive style. Our results support the perspective that inter-brain synchrony is a mechanism by which mature brains externally regulate immature brains to social living and suggest that one pathway by which sensitivity and intrusiveness exert their long-term effect may relate to the provision of coordinated inputs to the social brain during its sensitive period of maturation.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-02-01", "synthetic_support_claim": "Higher maternal sensitivity is linked with greater mother\u2013infant neural synchrony, while intrusiveness links to lower.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Maternal intrusiveness positively affects cognitive development in infants through enhanced inter-brain synchrony."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "0ba785b90968305a2db3ccb5f1fe0ac29f7ba833", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0ba785b90968305a2db3ccb5f1fe0ac29f7ba833", "title": "Mother-child dyadic interactions shape children\u2019s social brain and theory of mind", "abstract": "Social cognition develops through a complex interplay between neural maturation and environmental factors, yet the neurobehavioral mechanisms underlying this process remain unclear.

With its increasing popularity and competitiveness, interest in strategies to improve performance have emerged. Improving esports athlete performance, namely cognitive endurance, and resilience, may lie in nutritional or lifestyle factors. The Nutrition, Vision, and Cognition in Sport Studies (IONSport) investigated nutritional and behavioral factors that can influence cognition via 3-dimensional multiple objects tracking test (3DMOT) via Neurotracker X (NTx) software. The purpose of this study was to characterize the lifestyle of high level esports athletes with detailed nutrition, sleep, and physical activity assessments, and their association to gaming related cognitive performance. Methods 103 male and 16 elite female esports athletes aged 16 to 35 years old completed surveys, food records, and cognitive testing sessions over 10 days. Participants were instructed to maintain their normal dietary and lifestyle habits. Results There were positive significant associations between average NTx scores and the following nutrients: magnesium, phosphorous, potassium, sodium, zinc, selenium, thiamin, niacin, vitamins B6 and B12, folate, cholesterol, saturated, polyunsaturated, and monounsaturated fats, omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids, and choline. Majority of participants did not meet recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) for these micronutrients nor the recommended intakes for dairy, fruit, and vegetables. There was a significant (p = 0.003) positive (r = 0.272) association between total vegetable intake and average NTx score. There was a significant negative association (p = 0.015) with our final sustain session, which measured cognitive resilience, and the Stanford Sleepiness Scale score. Repeated measures analysis was done with these groups over the 18 core NTx sessions. There were significant (p = 0.018) differences between the two groups with those who consumed the recommended amount of protein or more performing significantly better on NTx over the 18 sessions than those that did not consume enough protein. Those who consumed the recommended intakes for riboflavin, phosphorous, vitamin B12, and selenium performed significantly better over the 18 core NTx sessions than those that did not meet the recommended amounts.

Such stability would enable the athletes to excel in their sporting field. Evidence shows that athletes develop specific cognitive abilities based on their sporting field. Nutrition is vital in creating an athlete\u2019s cognitive ability and physical needs required to participate in competitive sports. The reduction in the intake of nutrients required before, after and during sports participation could result in relative energy deficiency in sports (RED-S), affecting the parts of the body. Methods The rationale behind the survey is to understand the role of nutrition and energy deficiency on the athletes\u2019 cognitive abilities. The review\u2019s research areas were identified as athletes\u2019 cognition and nutrition in the context of RED-S. Search keywords were found based on the research area, such as \u201ccognitive\u201d, \u201cnutrition\u201d, and \u201cenergy deficiency/availability\u201d in athletes. The search keywords were combined to form search queries (SQs). SQs were used to carry out the search on the Web of Science and Scopus databases. Results Sports play an important role in athletes\u2019 cognitive abilities, such as decision-making, attention, memory, etc. Nutritional intakes, such as caffeinated, carbohydrate, alkaline, and protein-based supplements and diets, also significantly affect athletes\u2019 cognitive and motor abilities. Low energy availability (LEA) causes cognitive and physical health problems in both female and male athletes. Conclusion The review identified that nutrition and LEA play crucial roles in athletes\u2019 cognitive performance. Deficits in nutritional intake and energy availability lead to RED-S.

To address this issue and improve users\u2019 mental well-being, social media use interventions (eg, abstinence from social media) have been developed and evaluated. However, there is limited understanding of the effectiveness of these interventions in improving mental well-being. Objective This systematic review aimed to synthesize the literature on the effectiveness of social media use interventions in improving mental well-being in adults. Methods A systematic search (January 1, 2004, to July 31, 2022) was completed across 3 databases in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Experimental studies evaluating the impact of social media use interventions on mental well-being in adults were included. Outcomes related to mental well-being, such as depression, anxiety, stress, and loneliness, were included. A narrative synthesis without meta-analysis was completed to summarize the study characteristics and effectiveness by outcome and intervention type. The Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool was used to measure the quality of the studies. Results Of the 2785 studies identified through the systematic search, 23 (0.83%) were included in the analysis. Many of the included studies (9/23, 39%) found improvements in mental well-being, some (7/23, 30%) found mixed effects, and others (7/23, 30%) found no effect on mental well-being. Therapy-based interventions that used techniques such as cognitive behavioral therapy were more effective than limiting use of social media or full abstinence from social media, with 83% (5/6) of these studies showing improvements in mental well-being compared with 20% (1/5) and 25% (3/12), respectively. Depression was the most frequently investigated and improved outcome with 70% (7/10) of the studies showing a significant improvement in depression after the intervention, whereas other outcomes showed more varied results. Quality was poor, with 96% (22/23) of the studies receiving a weak global score, mostly for issues related to selection bias because most of the studies (16/23, 70%) used a convenience sampling of university students. Conclusions This review provides some evidence that social media use interventions are effective in improving mental well-being, especially for depression and when using therapy-based interventions.

Social media data can be leveraged to understand patient concerns and provide insight into why patients may turn to the internet instead of the health care system for health advice. Objective This study aimed to develop a method to investigate Reddit posts discussing health-related conditions. Our goal was to characterize these topics and identify trends in these social media\u2013based medical discussions. Methods Using an initial query, we collected 1 year of Reddit posts containing the phrases \u201cget tested\u201d and \u201cget checked.\u201d These posts were manually reviewed, and subreddits containing irrelevant posts were excluded from analysis. This selection of posts was manually read by the investigators to categorize posts into topics. A script was developed to automatically assign topics to additional posts based on keywords. Topic and keyword selections were refined based on manual review for more accurate topic assignment. Topic assignment was then performed on the entire 1-year Reddit dataset containing 347,130 posts. Related topics were grouped into broader medical disciplines. Analysis of the topic assignments was then conducted to assess condition and medical topic frequencies in medical condition\u2013focused subreddits and general subreddits. Results We created an automated algorithm to assign medical topics to Reddit posts. By iterating through multiple rounds of topic assignment, we improved the accuracy of the algorithm. Ultimately, this algorithm created 82 topics sorted into 17 broader medical disciplines. Of all topics, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), eye disorders, anxiety, and pregnancy had the highest post frequency overall. STIs comprised 7.44% (5876/78,980) of posts, and anxiety comprised 5.43% (4289/78,980) of posts. A total of 34% (28/82) of the topics comprised 80% (63,184/78,980) of all posts. Of the medical disciplines, those with the most posts were psychiatry and mental health; genitourinary and reproductive health; infectious diseases; and endocrinology, nutrition, and metabolism. Psychiatry and mental health comprised 26.6% (21,009/78,980) of posts, and genitourinary and reproductive health comprised 13.6% (10,741/78,980) of posts.

VMHC was employed to investigate the effects of ECT on bilateral hemispheric functional connectivity. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) was used to assess depressive symptoms, and the relationships between changes in HAMD scores and VMHC values were examined. Results: Following ECT, the depressive symptoms of all participants decreased (p < 0.001). The VMHC values in the dmPFC were significantly increased in both groups after ECT (p < 0.01). No significant correlation was found between the increasing VMHC values in the dmPFC and the changes in HAMD scores in depressed patients (p > 0.05).

However, along with its traditionally described executive dysfunction, more than half of the children diagnosed with ADHD have been reported to show difficulties with gross and fine motor skills, albeit motor impairments in ADHD continue to be a neglected area of clinical attention. The rapidly growing field of the clinical cognitive neuroscience of the cerebellum has begun to relate cerebro-cerebellar circuits to neurodevelopmental disorders. While the cerebellum\u2019s role in motor function, such as balance, motor coordination, and execution, is well recognized, ongoing research has evidenced its additional and fundamental role in neurocognitive development and executive function, including attention and social cognition, which are all areas of impairment commonly found in ADHD. Interestingly, neuroimaging studies have consistently shown differences in cerebellar volume and functional connectivity between ADHD and typically developing children. Furthermore, methylphenidate is known to act at the cerebellar level, as intrinsic cerebellar dopaminergic systems involved in attention and motor function have been identified. This article reviews some of the main findings linking cerebellar dysfunction to ADHD behavioral symptoms and incorporates the cerebellum as a possible neurological basis and differentiating indicator within the condition.

The idea of proactive suppression proposes a new fundamental perceptual mechanism to resolve this question, whereby attentional capture by a task-irrelevant salient distractor can be preempted through top-down inhibitory mechanisms. In this study, we replicate empirical effects underlying this claim, but show that they are better explained by an alternative mechanism, global target-feature enhancement. Identical to original studies using a capture-probe dual-task design, observers recalled fewer letters superimposed upon color singleton distractors, relative to other irrelevant search items (fillers). However, given that fillers (but not singleton distractors) always matched the color of the target, this effect could have been due to global featural attention to the target color rather than suppression of the singleton distractor. After manipulating the color of fillers such that they no longer matched the target color, probe recall associated with these was reduced, causing the relative \"suppression\" of singleton distractors to be abolished. We then manipulated the color similarity of targets and fillers, and found that filler probe recall was graded as a function of this color similarity, even within a single search context. This strongly suggests that increased attention to fillers due to global target color enhancement underlies the difference in attention among distractor items, not proactive distractor suppression. In contrast with feature enhancement and reactive suppression, the proposed proactive suppression mechanism still lacks convincing behavioral evidence.

Here, we investigated how feature repetition shapes the electrophysiological and behavioral correlates of target processing and distractor handling, testing theoretically informed predictions with single-trial mixed-effects modeling. In two experiments, the colors of a fixed-shape target and singleton distractor changed unpredictably across trials. Targets were color singletons in Experiment 1, allowing efficient search among pop-out items, but were not uniquely colored in Experiment 2, encouraging slower shape-feature search. Interference by the distractor occurred only in pop-out search but was reduced by repetition. This was paralleled by the contralateral electroencephalography (EEG) response: Following a search color change, the target-related N2pc was greatly reduced, and salient distractors elicited an N2pc followed by an enhanced PD. This biphasic response was absent in Experiment 2, where color was less useful to search.

The short answer is a resounding\"We Don't Know!\". In this paper, we show that we do not yet have the right tools to measure personality in language models. Personality is an important characteristic that influences behavior. As LLMs emulate human-like intelligence and performance in various tasks, a natural question to ask is whether these models have developed a personality. Previous works have evaluated machine personality through self-assessment personality tests, which are a set of multiple-choice questions created to evaluate personality in humans. A fundamental assumption here is that human personality tests can accurately measure personality in machines. In this paper, we investigate the emergence of personality in five LLMs of different sizes ranging from 1.5B to 30B. We propose the Option-Order Symmetry property as a necessary condition for the reliability of these self-assessment tests. Under this condition, the answer to self-assessment questions is invariant to the order in which the options are presented. We find that many LLMs personality test responses do not preserve option-order symmetry. We take a deeper look at LLMs test responses where option-order symmetry is preserved to find that in these cases, LLMs do not take into account the situational statement being tested and produce the exact same answer irrespective of the situation being tested. We also identify the existence of inherent biases in these LLMs which is the root cause of the aforementioned phenomenon and makes self-assessment tests unreliable. These observations indicate that self-assessment tests are not the correct tools to measure personality in LLMs. Through this paper, we hope to draw attention to the shortcomings of current literature in measuring personality in LLMs and call for developing tools for machine personality measurement.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-05-24", "synthetic_support_claim": "Self-assessment tests are not the correct tools to measure personality in Large Language Models.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Large Language Models exhibit consistent personalities across different applications and contexts."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "3bc821b26b91644e3323a7c369f262b460e1dda6", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3bc821b26b91644e3323a7c369f262b460e1dda6", "title": "Evaluating the Efficacy of LLMs to Emulate Realistic Human Personalities", "abstract": "To enhance immersion and engagement in video games, the design of Affective Non-Player Characters (NPCs) is a key focus for researchers and practitioners. Affective Computing frameworks improve Non-player characters (NPC) by providing personalities, emotions, and social relations. Large Language Models (LLMs) bring the promise to dynamically enhance character design when coupled with these frameworks, but further research is needed to validate the models truly represent human qualities. In this research, a comprehensive analysis investigates the capabilities of LLMs to generate content that aligns with human personality, using the Big Five and human responses from the International Personality Item Pool (IPIP) questionnaire. Our goal is to benchmark the performance of various LLMs, including frontier models and local models, against an extensive dataset comprising over 50,000 human surveys of self-reported personality tests to determine whether LLMs can replicate human-like decision-making with personality-driven prompts. A range of personality profiles were used to cluster the test results from the human survey dataset. Our methodology involved prompting LLMs with self-evaluated test items for each personality profile, comparing their outputs to human baseline responses, and evaluating the accuracy and consistency. Our findings show that some local models had 0% alignment of any personality profiles when compared to the human dataset, while the frontier models, in some cases, had 100% alignment. The results indicate that NPCs can successfully emulate human-like personality traits using LLMs, as demonstrated by benchmarking the LLM's output against human data.

Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 1240 primary school students aged 8\u201315 in Luzhou, Sichuan Province. Social anxiety was measured using the Social Anxiety Scale for Children (SASC), learning adaptability was assessed with the Children\u2019s Learning Adaptability Questionnaire (CSAQ), behavioral problems were evaluated using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), and AI tool usage was gauged through a self-developed questionnaire. Data analysis involved correlation and multiple regression analyses using SPSS, with the moderated mediation effect analyzed through Process Model 59. Results Social anxiety was found to significantly and positively predict behavioral problems, indicating that higher levels of social anxiety were associated with more behavioral problems. Learning adaptability partially mediated this relationship, suggesting that social anxiety not only directly impacts behavioral problems but also indirectly heightens the risk by reducing learning adaptability. Additionally, AI usage moderated the relationship between learning adaptability and behavioral problems, with a stronger effect of learning adaptability on behavioral problems observed at higher levels of AI usage. Specifically, the positive influence of learning adaptability on behavioral problems became more pronounced as AI usage increased, indicating that frequent AI use can amplify the impact of learning adaptability on behavioral outcomes.

Despite the findings that culturally adapted digital interventions have greater effectiveness, there is a lack of empirical evidence of interventions that have been culturally adapted or their adaptation documented. Objective This study aimed to document the cultural adaptation of the SilverCloud Health Space from Depression and Anxiety program for university students in Colombia and Mexico and evaluate user satisfaction with the adapted program. Methods A mixed methods process was based on Cultural Sensitivity and Ecological Validity frameworks. In phase 1, the research team added culturally relevant content (eg, expressions, personal stories, photos) for the target population to the intervention. In phase 2, potential users (9 university students) first evaluated the vignettes and photos used throughout the program. We calculated median and modal responses. They then participated in focus groups to evaluate and assess the cultural appropriateness of the materials. Their comments were coded into the 8 dimensions of the Ecological Validity Framework. Phase 3 consisted of choosing the vignettes most highly rated by the potential users and making modifications to the materials based on the student feedback. In the final phase, 765 actual users then engaged with the culturally adapted program and rated their satisfaction with the program. We calculated the percentage of users who agreed or strongly agreed that the modules were interesting, relevant, useful, and helped them attain their goals. Results The potential users perceived the original vignettes as moderately genuine, or true, which were given median scores between 2.5 and 3 (out of a possible 4) and somewhat identified with the situations presented in the vignettes given median scores between 1.5 and 3. The majority of comments or suggestions for modification concerned language (126/218, 57.5%), followed by concepts (50/218, 22.8%). Much less concerned methods (22/218, 10%), persons (9/218, 4.1%), context (5/218, 2.3%), or content (2/218, 0.9%). There were no comments about metaphors or goals. Intervention materials were modified based on these results. Of the actual users who engaged with the adapted version of the program, 87.7%-96.2% of them agreed or strongly agreed that the modules were interesting, relevant, useful, and helped them to attain their goals. Conclusions We conclude that the adapted version is satisfactory for this population based on the focus group discussions and the satisfaction scores.

Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often exhibit atypical sensory responses, which can impact self-care and other developmental areas. This study explores the impact of sensory and motor rehabilitation using a Motor Sensory Room to stimulate motor development in children with ASD. Methods: Twenty-five children with ASD, preschool and school-aged (2\u201310 years), were divided into three groups based on the DSM-5 severity levels.

Method Fifty-three mothers of children newly diagnosed with ASD completed the Beach Center Family Quality of Life Scale, the Autism Parenting Stress Index, the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire and the Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced Inventory. A descriptive analysis was conducted on the demographic characteristics of the family. Eta coefficients and Pearson's analysis were used to determine the associations between the variables and the FQoL dimensions. Hierarchical regression was used to determine whether variables explained a statistically significant family quality of life variance. Results Pearson's analysis and eta coefficients indicated several correlations. Hierarchical regression analysis showed that higher parental stress related to core autism symptoms was associated with poorer FQoL (95% CI \u22120.08 to \u22120.02, P = 0.001), and higher perceived treatment control was associated with better FQoL (95% CI 0.04\u20130.16, P = 0.001).

Qualitative data analysis was coded using Atlas.ti, and thematic analysis was used to develop and refine themes. This study is part of a larger study examining veterans' initiation of PTSD treatment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFindings indicate that male veterans in this sample may be reluctant to initiate PTSD care due to stigma, distrust of the military or mental health care, and a desire to avoid reliving their trauma.

This study aimed to qualitatively explore clients' experiences to better understand post\u2010treatment client changes and advance the development and effectiveness of AMP and other emerging positive valence\u2010focussed interventions.Transcripts were analysed from 11 participants who completed an optional qualitative interview after completing AMP treatment in a randomised controlled trial (NCT04945239).Two superordinate themes with several subthemes emerged. The first theme, Changes in Self, revealed common changes consistent with the core targets of AMP, as well as changes less explicitly targeted by AMP. The second theme, The Positivity Pivot, uncovered clients' perceptions on the emphasis of positive emotions in treatment. Overall, clients enjoyed and reaped benefits from amplifying positivity; some clients also reported wanting more time and space to discuss negative valence symptoms.People seeking treatment for anxiety or depression are receptive to amplifying positivity and experience the mental and social benefits of doing so. Positive valence\u2010centred treatments may therefore be valuable for some clients. Treatment protocols that integrate positive valence\u2010 and negative valence\u2010targeted approaches may be preferred by some clients.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-09-17", "synthetic_support_claim": "People seeking treatment for anxiety or depression experience mental and social benefits from amplifying positivity.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "AMP is universally effective for all individuals suffering from anxiety or depression regardless of personal differences."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "7f6b519103fcf5a8c7cbce0d1e9690614f902962", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7f6b519103fcf5a8c7cbce0d1e9690614f902962", "title": "Positive changes in daily life?

Individual alpha frequency (IAF) is a specific parameter accounting for the mean velocity of the alpha cycling activity, conventionally ranging between \u223c7 and \u223c13 Hz. One influential hypothesis has proposed a fundamental role of this cycling activity in the segmentation of sensory input and in the regulation of the speed of sensory processing, with faster alpha oscillations resulting in greater temporal resolution and more refined perceptual experience. However, although several recent theoretical and empirical studies would support this account, contradictory evidence suggests caution and more systematic approaches in the assessment and interpretation of this hypothesis. For example, it remains to be explored to what degree IAF shapes perceptual outcomes. In the present study, we investigated whether inter-individual differences in bias-free visual contrast detection threshold in a large sample of individuals in the general population (n = 122) could be explained by inter-individual differences in alpha pace. Our results show that the contrast needed to correctly identify target stimuli (individual perceptual threshold) is associated with alpha peak frequency (not amplitude). Specifically, individuals who require reduced contrast show higher IAF than individuals requiring higher contrasts. This suggests that inter-individual differences in alpha frequency contribute to performance variability in low-level perceptual tasks, supporting the hypothesis that IAF underlies a fundamental temporal sampling mechanism that shapes visual objective performance, with higher frequencies promoting enhanced sensory evidence per time unit.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-06-25", "synthetic_support_claim": "Inter-individual differences in alpha frequency contribute to performance variability in low-level perceptual tasks.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Alpha oscillation amplitude strongly predicts perceptual threshold variations in low-level visual tasks."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "50ec62dc13becee8f10a43cc6d90f8142f6c2d74", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/50ec62dc13becee8f10a43cc6d90f8142f6c2d74", "title": "Exploring the Relationship Between CAIDE Dementia Risk and EEG Signal Activity in a Healthy Population", "abstract": "Background: Accounting for dementia risk factors is essential in identifying people who would benefit most from intervention programs. The CAIDE dementia risk score is commonly applied, but its link to brain function remains unclear.

Methods: The sample comprised 38 participants aged between 54 and 79 (M = 67.05; SD = 6.02). Data were collected using paper-and-pencil tests and electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings in the resting state, channels FP1 and FP2.

Results: The CAIDE score is positively correlated with the relative power activation of the \u03b8 band and negatively correlated with the MMSE cognitive test score, and MMSE variations align with those found in distributions of EEG-extracted PSD-based features. Conclusions: The findings suggest that CAIDE scores can identify individuals without noticeable cognitive changes who already exhibit brain activity similar to that seen in people with dementia.

Although previous studies using clinical assessments have attempted to delineate differences between these disorders, the findings have been inconclusive. Our study aims to elucidate the differences of endophenotype between ASD, ADHD, and their co-occurring condition utilizing a uniform computerized test. Methods The study included children diagnosed with ASD, ASD co-occurring with ADHD (ASD+ADHD), or ADHD who completed the comprehensive attention test (CAT) at Severance Hospital between October 2013 to May 2023. We excluded children with intellectual disability and comorbid major psychiatric or neurologic disorders possibly affecting attention measurement. The participants were categorized into three groups for the comparative analysis of CAT measures: (a) ASD (n=112), (b) ASD+ADHD (n=155), and (c) ADHD (n=104). The study also conducted an exploratory analysis utilizing multivariate linear regression analysis to examine the association between the CAT measures and parent-reported scales. Results Notably, the ASD+ADHD and ADHD groups exhibited higher frequency of commission errors (CE) and perseveration errors (PE) compared to the ASD group. In the exploratory analysis, a significant negative association was observed between reaction time (RT) and both the social communication questionnaire (SCQ) and the child behavior checklist (CBCL) externalization scores in the ASD+ADHD and ADHD groups. The ASD+ADHD group tended to show higher standard deviation of reaction time (RTSD) compared to the ASD group. Conclusions Our findings suggest that impaired response inhibition is more pronounced in ADHD compared to ASD.

Methods: A short longitudinal design was used to test a path model where emotional/behavioral problems and school climate predicted cybervictimization and online sexual harassment, controlling for their co-occurrence. Results: The results show similar prevalence among the two phenomena with a consistent reciprocal association (\u03c1s = 0.426**).

Previous studies have tried to investigate neuroanatomical features related to anxiety mostly using univariate analyses and thus giving rise to contrasting results. The aim of this study is to build a predictive model of individual differences in trait anxiety from brain morphometric features, by taking advantage of a combined data fusion machine learning approach to allow generalization to new cases. Additionally, we aimed to perform a network analysis to test the hypothesis that anxiety-related networks have a central role in modulating other networks not strictly associated with anxiety. Finally, we wanted to test the hypothesis that trait anxiety was associated with specific cognitive emotion regulation strategies, and whether anxiety may decrease with ageing. Structural brain images of 158 participants were first decomposed into independent covarying gray and white matter networks with a data fusion unsupervised machine learning approach (Parallel ICA). Then, supervised machine learning (decision tree) and backward regression were used to extract and test the generalizability of a predictive model of trait anxiety. Two covarying gray and white matter independent networks successfully predicted trait anxiety. The first network included mainly parietal and temporal regions such as the postcentral gyrus, the precuneus, and the middle and superior temporal gyrus, while the second network included frontal and parietal regions such as the superior and middle temporal gyrus, the anterior cingulate, and the precuneus. We also found that trait anxiety was positively associated with catastrophizing, rumination, other- and self-blame, and negatively associated with positive refocusing and reappraisal. Moreover, trait anxiety was negatively associated with age.

Notably, the capacity to express and control anger is of great importance to modulate our reactions in interpersonal situations. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that anger expression and control are negatively correlated and that both can be decoded by the same patterns of grey and white matter features of a fronto-temporal brain network. To this aim, a data fusion unsupervised machine learning technique, known as transposed Independent Vector Analysis (tIVA), was used to decompose the brain into covarying GM\u2013WM networks and then backward regression was used to predict both anger expression and control from a sample of 212 healthy subjects. Confirming our hypothesis, results showed that anger control and anger expression are negatively correlated, the more individuals control anger, the less they externalize it. At the neural level, individual differences in anger expression and control can be predicted by the same GM\u2013WM network. As expected, this network included lateral and medial frontal regions, the insula, temporal regions, and the precuneus. The higher the concentration of GM\u2013WM in this brain network, the higher the level of externalization of anger, and the lower the anger control.

Although they are, respectively, associated with increased and decreased activity in the default mode network (DMN), the specific contributions of deliberate and spontaneous MW, and their relationships with mindfulness abilities and resting-state macro networks remain to be elucidated. Therefore, resting-state MRI scans from 76 participants were analyzed with group independent component analysis to decompose brain networks into independent macro-networks and to see which of them predicted specific aspects of spontaneous and deliberate MW or mindfulness traits. Our results show that temporal variability of the resting-state DMN predicts spontaneous MW, which in turn is negatively associated with the acting with awareness facet of mindfulness. This finding shows that the DMN is not directly associated with overall mindfulness, but rather demonstrates that there exists a close relationship between DMN and MW, and furthermore, that the involvement of mindfulness abilities in this dynamic may be secondary. In sum, our study contributes to a better understanding of the neural bases of spontaneous MW and its relationship with mindfulness.

In this same task, motivated effort, determined by rate of button press, determined success at obtaining or avoiding scents. Success rate, calculated based on the number of responses where participants\u2019 button presses exceeded an individual threshold set in a practice trial, differed across groups (p\u2009=\u20090.048), driven by mildly symptomatic carriers, who were consistently unsuccessful. There was a group difference in variability in button press rate across trials (p\u2009=\u20090.007), driven by mildly symptomatic carriers who showed less varied effort between scents. These findings suggest alterations to reward functioning can be detected early in bvFTD, even before meeting diagnostic criteria.

Depression in Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is common, disabling and has poor outcomes. Motivational symptoms such as apathy and anhedonia, are prominent in PD depression and related to dopaminergic loss. We hypothesised that dopamine-dependent disruption in effort-based decision-making contributes to depression in PD. In the present study, an effort-based decision-making task was administered to 62 patients with PD, with and without depression, ON and OFF their dopaminergic medication across two sessions, as well as to 34 patients with depression and 29 matched controls on a single occasion. During the task, on each trial, participants decided whether to accept or reject offers of different levels of monetary reward in return for exerting varying levels of physical effort via grip force, measured using individually calibrated dynamometers. The primary outcome variable was choice (accept/decline offer), analysed using both logistic mixed-effects modelling and a computational model which dissected the individual contributions of reward and effort on depression and dopamine state in PD. We found PD depression was characterised by lower acceptance of offers, driven by markedly lower incentivisation by reward (reward sensitivity), compared to all other groups. Within-subjects analysis of the effect of dopamine medication revealed that, although dopamine treatment improves reward sensitivity in non-depressed PD patients, this therapeutic effect is not present in PD patients with depression.

Method In this study, a questionnaire method was employed to conduct the Adolescent Athlete Non-Intellectual Factors Survey Scale on 1,200 college students. From this sample, 287 individuals with exercise anxiety were identified through an endurance exercise test and the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire (AAQ-II) subsequently administered as well as The Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE). Subsequently, statistical analyses including correlation, regression, and mediation were performed using SPSS26 as the analytical tool. Additionally, the bias-corrected nonparametric percentile Bootstrap method was used to test for the mediating effects and estimate the confidence intervals with 5,000 iterations, and the confidence interval (CI) was set at 95%. Finally, in AMOS24, a mediating construct was established by incorporating exercise anxiety as the dependent variable, endurance exercise behavior as the independent variable, and negative physical sensations and experiential avoidance as the mediating variables (R\u2009=\u20090.619, R2\u2009=\u20090.384).

Self-efficacy refers to one's confidence in their ability to use AI, while AI-related anxiety pertains to the fear or concern when interacting with these systems. These variables can influence technological dependence, affecting academic performance and emotional well-being. Objective: This study aims to examine the influence of self-efficacy in AI use and anxiety toward AI on AI dependence among Peruvian university students. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted with 528 Peruvian university students aged 18 to 37 years (M = 19.00, SD = 3.84). Scales were used to measure AI self-efficacy, anxiety toward AI, and AI dependence. Correlation and multiple regression analyses were applied to identify predictors of technological dependence. Results: The results showed that AI self-efficacy was positively correlated with AI anxiety (r = 0.43, p < .01) and AI dependence (r = 0.61, p < .01). Anxiety also significantly correlated with AI dependence (r = 0.71, p < .01). Multiple regression analysis revealed that both AI anxiety (\u03b2 = 1.131, p < .001) and AI self-efficacy (\u03b2 = 0.610, p < .001) predicted AI dependence. Additionally, business administration students exhibited greater dependence compared to students from other fields (\u03b2 = 1.025, p < .05).

Interestingly, while few studies suggest that engaging in unplanned purchase actions (i.e. impulsive buying) is not always associated with negative emotions among customers (i.e. postpurchase cognitive dissonance), others suggest that impulsive buying is directly associated with cognitive dissonance. This paper aims to investigate and understand the key antecedents of online impulsive buying among Moroccan Gen Z consumers, and how it contributes to postpurchase dissonance. The authors also try to gain deeper insights by investigating the disparities between males and females using mutigroup analysis.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nBased on data collected from 333 Moroccan Gen Zers, the hypothesized model was empirically tested using a partial least squares estimation.\n\n\nFindings\nFirst, the results confirm that impulsive buying is positively associated with postpurchase dissonance. Second, while hedonic shopping motivation, fear of missing out and materialism were found to significantly impact online impulsive buying, price value and online reviews had no significant effect on online impulsive purchases. The importance\u2013performance matrix also suggests that the fear of missing out is the most important factor leading to online impulsive buying, followed by hedonic shopping motivation and materialism. Finally, the results confirm that female shoppers are more likely to engage in impulsive buying behavior, and this was mainly due to higher fear of missing out, hedonic shopping motivation and materialism.\n\n\nPractical implications\nFirst, the study findings can help online merchants to construct well-designed online shopping platforms and effective e-marketing tactics to stimulate purchase intentions among Gen Z shoppers. Online merchants should also attempt to reduce the negative feelings associated with unplanned buying behavior by introducing additional incentives, effective consumer interactivity and flexible return policies. This would help online suppliers in retaining customers and transforming impulse purchases into more recurrent ones. Second, online retailers should take into consideration the differences between male and female consumers by appealing to the role of gender in purchase situations when marketing their products and services. Finally, the findings offer interesting implications to society by allowing online shoppers to make well-informed purchase decisions without being influenced by personal and products\u2019 traits.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nWhile prior research assessed the investigated constructs in separate models, the study suggests an integrated framework that incorporates different determinants of online impulsive shopping as well as its impact on postpurchase cognitive dissonance. Additionally, the authors explored the moderating effect of gender to gain deeper insights with regard to the disparities between males and females while engaging in online impulsive buying.

Anger is a strong feeling of annoyance, displeasure, or hostility. It is a blaming emotion that is aimed against individuals, and it frequently leads to violent actions. However, anger serves survival purposes and is embedded in humans. While anger is typically viewed as a psychological or social phenomenon, it also has a biological basis. This literature review focuses on anger and its underlying biological foundations. The biological basis of anger can be explained through the activation of the amygdala, which plays a crucial role in emotional processing. Additionally, studies have shown that anger is associated with decreased activity in the prefrontal cortex. When a person becomes angry, this region of the brain is less active, leading to impulsive behaviors and decreased rational thinking. This explains why individuals often engage in aggressive or violent behaviors when angry. Understanding the biological basis of anger can help us better manage and control this emotion.

Declines in speech-in-noise performance are well documented in healthy aging, and are, unsurprisingly, associated with differences in hearing ability.

Here I focus on specialization for processing of speech and music, the two most important auditory communication systems that humans possess. A great deal of evidence from lesion studies and functional imaging suggests that aspects of music linked to the processing of pitch patterns depend more on right than left auditory networks. A complementary specialization for temporal resolution has been suggested for left auditory networks. These diverse findings can be integrated within the context of the spectrotemporal modulation framework, which has been developed as a way to characterize efficient neuronal encoding of complex sounds. Recent studies show that degradation of spectral modulation impairs melody perception but not speech content, whereas degradation of temporal modulation has the opposite effect. Neural responses in the right and left auditory cortex in those studies are linked to processing of spectral and temporal modulations, respectively. These findings provide a unifying model to understand asymmetries in terms of sensitivity to acoustical features of communication sounds in humans. However, this explanation does not account for evidence that asymmetries can shift as a function of learning, attention, or other top-down factors. Therefore, it seems likely that asymmetries arise both from bottom-up specialization for acoustical modulations and top-down influences coming from hierarchically higher components of the system.

Consultants and teachers then collaboratively work together to select strategies to focus on in consultation, allowing for flexibility and individualization based on individual teacher and child strengths and challenges.We address the following two aims: (1) examine teaching practices and children's behavior at the beginning of consultation and how these data resulted in different recommended teaching strategies, based on our standardized formula, (2) present three case examples to further illustrate how these data guided consultation to improve social and emotional teaching practices during the 2023 to 2024 school year. We found that this baseline data collection and the subsequent data-driven process for selecting strategies was feasible in that all consultants and teachers served by ECMHC were able to use it. We also found variability in baseline data and the associated ECMHC teaching strategies recommended, suggesting that the measures were sensitive to unique classroom needs and individualized recommended strategies accordingly.We discuss how this approach allowed consultants to tailor ECMHC services to the unique strengths and challenges of each child and teacher dyad, while being firmly grounded in empirical research and previously validated assessments.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-01-10", "synthetic_support_claim": "Baseline data collection and data-driven processes for selecting strategies in ECMHC are feasible and individualized.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "ECMHC conclusively eliminates all instances of challenging behavior in early childhood classrooms."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "4ba41ca1f336d6a10232357ccd04b105bbb6bb24", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4ba41ca1f336d6a10232357ccd04b105bbb6bb24", "title": "Cognition and Mental Health in Pediatric Patients Following COVID-19", "abstract": "The global coronavirus pandemic has significantly impacted public health and has been a research subject since its emergence in 2019.

Alarmingly, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) not only infects the lungs but also influences the heart and brain. Endothelial cell dysfunction and hypercoagulation, which we know occur with this infection, lead to thrombo-inflammation that can manifest as many myriad cardio-cerebrovascular disorders, such as brain fog, fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, etc. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 has been associated with oxidative stress, protein aggregation, cytokine storm, and mitochondrial dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases. Accordingly, the identification of molecular targets involved in these actions could provide strategies for preventing and treating this disease. In particular, the very common enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) has recently been identified as a candidate co-receptor for the cell entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with its involvement in infection. In addition, DPPIV has been reported as a co-receptor for some viruses such as Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV). It mediates immunologic reactions and diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, and hypertension, which have been considered the prime risk factors for stroke among other types of cardio-cerebrovascular diseases. Unlike angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), DPPIV has been implicated in aggravating the course of infection due to its disruptive effect on inflammatory signaling networks and the neuro\u2013glia\u2013vascular unit.

However, the most widely adopted approach for the extraction of psycholinguistic features is to use the Linguistic Inquiry Word Count (LIWC) dictionary and various affective lexicons. Other features related to cultural factors and suicide risk have not been explored. Moreover, the use of social networking behavioral features and profile features would limit the generalizability of the model. Therefore, our study aimed at building a prediction model of depression for text-only social media data through a wider range of possible linguistic features related to depression, and illuminate the relationship between linguistic expression and depression. Methods We collected 789 users\u2019 depression scores as well as their past posts on Weibo, and extracted a total of 117 lexical features via Simplified Chinese Linguistic Inquiry Word Count, Chinese Suicide Dictionary, Chinese Version of Moral Foundations Dictionary, Chinese Version of Moral Motivation Dictionary, and Chinese Individualism/Collectivism Dictionary. Results Results showed that all the dictionaries contributed to the prediction. The best performing model occurred with linear regression, with the Pearson correlation coefficient between predicted values and self-reported values was 0.33, the R-squared was 0.10, and the split-half reliability was 0.75. Discussion This study did not only develop a predictive model applicable to text-only social media data, but also demonstrated the importance taking cultural psychological factors and suicide related expressions into consideration in the calculation of word frequency.

Natural language processing (NLP), a branch of artificial intelligence, offers the potential for improving depression screening by extracting meaningful information from textual data, but there are challenges and ethical considerations. Objective This literature review aims to explore existing NLP methods for detecting depression, discuss successes and limitations, address ethical concerns, and highlight potential biases. Methods A literature search was conducted using Semantic Scholar, PubMed, and Google Scholar to identify studies on depression screening using NLP. Keywords included \u201cdepression screening,\u201d \u201cdepression detection,\u201d and \u201cnatural language processing.\u201d Studies were included if they discussed the application of NLP techniques for depression screening or detection. Studies were screened and selected for relevance, with data extracted and synthesized to identify common themes and gaps in the literature. Results NLP techniques, including sentiment analysis, linguistic markers, and deep learning models, offer practical tools for depression screening. Supervised and unsupervised machine learning models and large language models like transformers have demonstrated high accuracy in a variety of application domains. However, ethical concerns related to privacy, bias, interpretability, and lack of regulations to protect individuals arise. Furthermore, cultural and multilingual perspectives highlight the need for culturally sensitive models. Conclusions NLP presents opportunities to enhance depression detection, but considerable challenges persist.

Our model is designed to process Chinese data and capture the nuances of text locality, context, and logical structure through a fine-grained text enhancement approach. It features a complex parallel architecture with multiple convolution kernels, operating on two distinct task channels to mine relevant features.

In particular, cooperation can evolve in stochastic games even if it is infeasible in each separate repeated game. In stochastic games, participants have an interest in conditioning their strategies on the state of the environment. Yet in many applications, precise information about the state could be scarce. Here, we study how the availability of information (or lack thereof) shapes evolution of cooperation. Already for simple examples of two state games we find surprising effects.

Evacuation models are essential tools for assessing these risks and for ensuring the safety of individuals during emergencies. The primary objective of an evacuation model is to realistically simulate the process by which a large group of people can reach available exits efficiently. This paper introduces an agent-based evacuation model that represents the environment as a rectangular grid, where individuals, obstacles, and exits interact dynamically. The model employs only five rules to simulate evacuation dynamics while also accounting for complex factors such as movement and stagnation. Different from many evacuation models, this approach includes rules that account for common behaviors exhibited in stressful evacuation situations such as accidents, hysteria, and disorientation. By incorporating these behavioral conditions, the model more accurately reflects the real-life reactions of individuals during evacuation, leading to more realistic and applicable results. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, comprehensive experiments and case studies are conducted in diverse urban settings. The results of these experiments demonstrate that the model offers valuable insights into the evacuation process and provides a more precise assessment of its behavior in emergency scenarios.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-10-25", "synthetic_support_claim": "The agent-based evacuation model includes rules for accidents, hysteria, and disorientation in emergencies.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "\"The agent-based evacuation model can predict evacuation times with 100% accuracy in all scenarios.\""}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "d6b5452d5dfc0bdc3e571166ebafc1d86a544bd0", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d6b5452d5dfc0bdc3e571166ebafc1d86a544bd0", "title": "Do as We Do, Not as You Think: the Conformity of Large Language Models", "abstract": "Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) revolutionize the field of intelligent agents, enabling collaborative multi-agent systems capable of tackling complex problems across various domains.

This paper presents a comprehensive study on conformity in LLM-driven multi-agent systems, focusing on three aspects: the existence of conformity, the factors influencing conformity, and potential mitigation strategies. In particular, we introduce BenchForm, a new conformity-oriented benchmark, featuring reasoning-intensive tasks and five distinct interaction protocols designed to probe LLMs' behavior in collaborative scenarios. Several representative LLMs are evaluated on BenchForm, using metrics such as conformity rate and independence rate to quantify conformity's impact. Our analysis delves into factors influencing conformity, including interaction time and majority size, and examines how the subject agent rationalizes its conforming behavior. Furthermore, we explore two strategies to mitigate conformity effects, i.e., developing enhanced personas and implementing a reflection mechanism.

This approach is common in certain subfields.

It is, therefore, essential to understand and support students' emotional experiences to enhance online education, especially under the COVID-19 context. However, to date, very few studies have investigated how students' achievement emotions might be affected by teaching and learning factors in online learning environments. Objectives: Based on Pekrun's (2006) control-value theory of achievement emotions, this study examined the influence of students' perceived online teaching quality and appraisals of control and value on their achievement emotions in an online second language (L2) learning context instigated by the COVID-19. Methods: Data were collected using an online survey of 1503 undergraduates from ten universities across different regions of China. Confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) were performed to test the validity of the instruments and structural equation modelling were conducted to examine the relations between L2 teaching and learning variables. Results and Conclusions: Results revealed that perceived teacher internet and communication technology competence had positive effects on enjoyment, but negative effects on anxiety and boredom, and these effects were fully mediated by perceived control and/or value. Perceived chaotic teaching structure (CTS) had reverse effects for the three emotions. Perceived CTS effects on enjoyment and anxiety were fully and partially mediated by perceived control, respectively. Takeaways: Online teaching quality is critical for students' appraisals and emotions towards L2 learning. Teachers should strive to improve online teaching quality and design interventions targeting students' perceived control and value to temper their affective experiences associated with the crisis-prompted online teaching practices. \u00a9 2023 The Authors.

Results A total of 13 articles, including 425 participants aged 8.9\u223c16.8 years, were included. Frequency analysis revealed that exercise induced enhanced activation in frontal, parietal, occipital, limbic system and cerebellum (P < 0.01). Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) meta-analysis revealed that exercise altered the activation status of the frontal association (medial frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus and precentral gyrus), cuneus, lingual gyrus, cingulate gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, caudate nucleus and cerebellar apex, with the volume of activation in the frontal association accounting for 61.81% of the total activation cluster volume and an enhanced activation effect. Additionally, the study design, age, gender, nationality, cognitive tasks, as well as exercise intensity, intervention time, and type of exercise may be potential moderating variables. Particularly, sustained exercise induced a decrease in activation in the left parahippocampal gyrus, culmen, and lingual gyrus, while variable exercise induced an increase in activation in the left middle frontal gyrus. Conclusion Exercise-induced activation increase in the frontal associative areas of children and adolescents is dominant, especially longer periods of moderate-intensity variable exercise can induce more brain region activation.

The WHO led Global Scales for Early Development (GSED) project aims to provide population and programmatic level measures of ECD for 0\u20133\u2009years that are valid, reliable and have psychometrically stable performance across geographical, cultural and language contexts. This paper reports on the creation of two measures: (1) the GSED Short Form (GSED-SF)\u2014a caregiver reported measure for population-evaluation\u2014self-administered with no training required and (2) the GSED Long Form (GSED-LF)\u2014a directly administered/observed measure for programmatic evaluation\u2014administered by a trained professional.

While electroencephalography (EEG) has been used to study the differences in brain activity between VR-based action observation and kinesthetic motor imagery (KMI), there has been no investigation into their combined effect. Prior research has demonstrated that VR-based action observation can enhance MI by providing both visual information and embodiment, which is the perception of oneself as part of the observed entity. Additionally, KMI has been found to produce similar brain activity to physically performing a task. Therefore, we hypothesized that utilizing VR to offer an immersive visual scenario for action observation while participants performed kinesthetic motor imagery would significantly improve cortical activity related to MI. Methods In this study, 15 participants (9 male, 6 female) performed kinesthetic motor imagery of three hand tasks (drinking, wrist flexion-extension, and grabbing) both with and without VR-based action observation.

Conventional methods for EEG-based mental health evaluation often depend on manually crafted features or basic machine learning approaches, like support vector classifiers or superficial neural networks. Despite the potential of these approaches, they often fall short in capturing the intricate spatiotemporal relationships within EEG data, leading to lower classification accuracy and poor adaptability across various populations and mental health scenarios. Methods To overcome these limitations, we introduce the EEG Mind-Transformer, an innovative deep learning architecture composed of a Dynamic Temporal Graph Attention Mechanism (DT-GAM), a Hierarchical Graph Representation and Analysis (HGRA) module, and a Spatial-Temporal Fusion Module (STFM). The DT-GAM is designed to dynamically extract temporal dependencies within EEG data, while the HGRA models the brain's hierarchical structure to capture both localized and global interactions among different brain regions. The STFM synthesizes spatial and temporal elements, generating a comprehensive representation of EEG signals. Results and discussion Our empirical results confirm that the EEG Mind-Transformer significantly surpasses conventional approaches, achieving an accuracy of 92.5%, a recall of 91.3%, an F1-score of 90.8%, and an AUC of 94.2% across several datasets. These findings underline the model's robustness and its generalizability to diverse mental health conditions.

The decline in communal spaces such as libraries, youth clubs and community centres mean that there are fewer opportunities to meet and mix socially with other generations outside our own families. Increased working hours, improved technology, changes in family patterns, relationship breakdowns within families and migration are also believed to be contributory factors to generation segregation. There are many potential economic, social and political impacts of generations living separate and parallel lives, for example, higher health and social care costs, an undermining of trust between generations reduced social capital, a reliance on the media to form understanding of others\u2019 viewpoints and higher levels of anxiety and loneliness. Intergenerational programmes and activities can take many forms and are delivered in many settings.\u202f Evidence suggests\u202fthat\u202fintergenerational activity can have a positive impact on participants, for example, in reducing loneliness and exclusion for both older people and children and young people, improving mental health, increasing mutual understanding and addressing important issues such as ageism, housing and care. There are currently no other EGMs that exist that address this type of intervention; however, it would complement existing EGMs addressing child welfare. Objectives To identify, appraise and bring together the evidence on the use of intergenerational\u202fpractice, to answer the following specific research questions: What is the volume, nature and diversity of research on,\u202fand evaluation of,\u202fintergenerational practice and learning? What approaches have been used to deliver intergenerational activities and programmes that may be relevant to providing such services during and in the subsequent recovery from the COVID\u201019 pandemic? What promising intergenerational activities and programmes have been developed and are being used but have not yet been subject to formal evaluation? Search Methods We searched MEDLINE (via OvidSp), EMBASE (via OvidSp), PsycINFO (via OvidSp), CINAHL (via EBSCOHost), Social Policy and Practice (via OvidSp), Health Management Information Consortium (via OvidSp), Ageline (via EBSCOhost), ASSIA (via ProQuest), Social Science Citations Index (via Web of Science), ERIC (via EBSCOhost), Community Care Inform Children, Research in Practice for Children, ChildData (via Social Policy and Practice), the Campbell Library, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and the CENTRAL database between 22 and 30 July 2021.

Selection Criteria Any intervention that brings older and younger people together with the purpose of interacting to achieve positive health and/or social and/or educational outcomes from any study design including systematic reviews, randomised controlled studies, observational studies, surveys and qualitative studies are included. The titles and abstracts, and later full texts, of records identified by the search methods were screened against inclusion criteria by two independent reviewers. Data Collection and Analysis Data extraction was undertaken by one reviewer and checked by a second with any inconsistencies identified and resolved through discussion. The data extraction tool was developed on EPPI reviewer and was modified and tested through stakeholder and advisor consultation, and piloting of the process. The tool was informed by the research question and the structure of the map. We did not undertake quality appraisal of the included studies. Main Results Our searches identified 12,056 references, after screening 500 research articles were included in the evidence gap map conducted across 27 countries. We identified 26 systematic reviews, 236 quantitative comparative studies (of which 38 were randomised controlled trials), 227 were qualitative studies (or had a qualitative element), 105 were observational studies (or had elements of observational methods) and 82 used a mixed methods approach. The outcomes reported in the research cover mental health (n\u2009=\u200973), physical health (n\u2009=\u200962), attainment and knowledge (n\u2009=\u2009165), agency (n\u2009=\u2009174), mental wellbeing (n\u2009=\u2009224), loneliness and social isolation (n\u2009=\u200954), attitudes towards the other generation (n\u2009=\u2009283), intergenerational interactions (n\u2009=\u2009196), peer interactions (n\u2009=\u200930) and health promotion (n\u2009=\u200923) and including mutual outcomes such as the impact on community (n\u2009=\u200937) and perceptions on the sense of community (n\u2009=\u200943). Gaps in the evidence that were identified include: research that reports on mutual, societal and community outcomes of intergenerational interventions; more research on interventions classified as levels 1\u20134 and level 7 on the Intergenerational Engagement Scale, mental health, loneliness, social isolation, peer interactions, physical health and health promotion outcomes in children and young people; health promotion in older people; outcomes centred on care giver wellbeing, mental health and attitudes; economic outcomes; process outcomes and adverse or unexpected outcomes. Authors\u2019 Conclusions Whilst a substantional amount of research on intergenerational interventions has been identified in this EGM, as well as the gaps identified above, there is a need to explore promising interventions not yet formally evaluated. Research on this topic is gradually increasing, and systematic reviews will be important to determine how and why interventions are or are not beneficial. However, the primary research needs to build more cohesively so that the findings can be comparable and avoid research waste.

Intergenerational activities are interventions designed to bring together older and younger generations with the purpose of allowing participants to utilise their experiences and skills, and to give participants a chance to experience the pleasure and excitement that occurs with the transmission of knowledge and skills from one generation to another. Intergenerational activities are therefore potential interventions that can address the growing problems associated with loneliness and lack of wellbeing.This systematic review aims to examine the impact of intergenerational interventions on the wellbeing and mental health in children and adolescents, and potential harmful effects. It also aims to identify areas for future research as well as key messages for service commissioners.We searched an evidence and gap map published in 2022 (comprehensive searches conducted July 2021 and updated June 2023) to identify randomised controlled trials of intergenerational interventions that report mental health and wellbeing outcomes for children and young people.Randomised controlled trials of intergenerational interventions that involved unrelated younger and older people with at least one skipped generation between them and reported mental health or wellbeing outcomes for children and young people were included in this review.We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Campbell Collaboration. We conducted data extraction and Cochrane risk of bias assessments in EPPI reviewer.While we identified 500 evaluations of intergenerational interventions, where the impact on participating children and/or young people was evaluated this was most often limited to assessing their impact on attitudes to aging. We identified five studies evaluating five different types of intergenerational interventions which included one\u2010off sessions to ones that spanned a year measuring their impact on the mental health and wellbeing of children and/or young people. The purposes of the interventions differed, which included promoting social skills, preventing harmful behaviour and promoting learning. The ages of children also varied across the five studies, with one targeting younger children, two targeting younger teenagers and two targeting older teenagers. One study included socioeconomically disadvantaged children, and in the other studies the socioeconomic backgrounds of the children and young people were not described. The outcome measures used to evaluate the interventions varied with none of the studies measuring the same outcomes. One study showed improvements in wellbeing measures, and this was an intervention delivered to children in deprived neighbourhoods, where the intervention duration was for a year allowing the development of a greater depth of relationship between the younger and older participants. Four studies found no\u2026\u2026. The included studies were at high risk of bias therefore raising uncertainty in the reliability of the findings. Underpinning theories that supported the development of the interventions and explained the mechanisms of effect were poorly described.The evidence for the effectiveness of intergenerational interventions on the mental health and wellbeing of children and young people is limited and inconclusive. Few evaluations have sought to measure how intergenerational interventions impact children and young people and where this impact is measured the focus is usually limited to attitudes to aging. The evidence that has been collected is too heterogenous to allow synthesis of the findings. The underpinning theories to support their development are poorly described with no follow\u2010up data to ascertain if benefits are maintained. Intergenerational interventions show promise but researchers have failed to measure how they impact on the mental health and wellbeing of children and young people. This is a serious limitation of the evidence base that needs to be addressed in robust and rigorous evaluations.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2024-08-18", "synthetic_support_claim": "The evidence for intergenerational interventions' impact on children's mental health and wellbeing is limited and inconclusive.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Intergenerational interventions significantly improve the mental health and wellbeing of children and young people."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "429018afa31d88c81358e95feb6459a89c1d16a5", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/429018afa31d88c81358e95feb6459a89c1d16a5", "title": "Intergenerational Relationships and Their Impact on Social Resilience Amongst Arab Society Elderly Populations: A Qualitative Exploration.", "abstract": "AIM\nTo explore the impact of intergenerational relationships on the social resilience of elderly populations in Arab societies.

Thirty-seven participants volunteered to participate in our study, in which their brain activities were recorded when watching five selected film clips (corresponding to five positive emotions: amusement, happiness, romance, tenderness and warmth).

However, emotions are complex and extracting salient EEG features underlying distinct emotional states is inherently limited by low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and low spatial resolution of practical EEG data, which is further compounded by the lack of effective spatio-temporal filter optimization approaches for generic EEG features. To address these challenges, this study proposes a set of neural networks termed the Filter-Bank Spatio-Temporal Convolutional Networks (FBSTCNets) for performing end-to-end multi-class emotion recognition via robust extraction of power and/or connectivity features from EEG. First, a filter bank is employed to construct a multiview spectral representation of EEG data. Next, a temporal convolutional layer, followed by a depth-wise spatial convolutional layer, performs spatio-temporal filtering, transforming EEG into latent signals with higher SNR. A feature extraction layer then extracts power and/or connectivity features from the latent signals. Finally, a fully connected layer with a cropped decoding strategy predicts the emotional state. Experimental results on two public emotion EEG datasets, SEED and SEED-IV, demonstrate that FBSTCNets outperform previous benchmark methods in decoding accuracy.

In addition, structural equation modeling was used to test the mediating roles of internet addiction and phubbing among a sample of young adults (N = 603). Results showed that social media addiction was associated with poorer mental health via internet addiction and phubbing. More specifically, associations between social media addiction and stress, and social media addiction and anxiety were explained by both internet addiction and phubbing. The association between social media addiction and depression was explained by internet addiction only. These results remained consistent after controlling for gender, age, frequency of internet use, frequency of social media use, and frequency of smartphone use. These findings extend the extant literature by providing evidence for the dual roles of internet addiction and phubbing in explaining the relationship between social media addiction and poor mental health. Social media addiction did not directly influence poorer mental health but did via internet addiction and phubbing.

Since one of the primary motivations for cell phone use is internet access, it is crucial to assess the time that individuals spend online to measure the prevalence of phubbing as a social behaviour disorder. This study aimed to better understand and evaluate the phubbing phenomenon by predicting future trends in internet usage using machine learning techniques. Four machine learning models\u2014an artificial neural network (ANN), support vector regression (SVR), random forest (RF) regression, and time series\u2014were employed to predict the average internet usage. Data from 2014 to 2024 were obtained from the World Bank, and cross-validation was used to enhance the reliability and accuracy of the models. All four models were successful in predicting internet usage, with the ANN showing the highest accuracy, followed by SVR, RF, and the time series. According to the data, the average daily time spent online increased from 277 min in 2014 to 417 min in 2024. Projections based on these machine learning models estimate that this figure will rise to 507 min by 2030 and 603 min by 2035.

Consequently, a plethora of health behavior change theories has been developed with the intention of elucidating the mechanisms underlying health behavior change and identifying key domains that enhance the likelihood of successful outcomes. Until now, only few studies have taken into account neurobiological correlates underlying health behavior change processes. Recent progress in the neuroscience of motivation and reward systems has provided further insights into the relevance of such domains. The aim of this contribution is to review the latest explanations of health behavior change initiation and maintenance based on novel insights into motivation and reward mechanisms. Based on a systematic literature search in PubMed, PsycInfo, and Google Scholar, four articles were reviewed. As a result, a description of motivation and reward systems (approach/wanting = pleasure; aversion/avoiding = relief; assertion/non-wanting = quiescence) and their role in health behavior change processes is presented. Three central findings are discussed: (1) motivation and reward processes allow to distinguish between goal-oriented and stimulus-driven behavior, (2) approach motivation is the key driver of the individual process of behavior change until a new behavior is maintained and assertion motivation takes over, (3) behavior change techniques can be clustered based on motivation and reward processes according to their functional mechanisms into facilitating (= providing external resources), boosting (= strengthening internal reflective resources) and nudging (= activating internal affective resources).

This form of behavior has seen its prevalence increase over the past few decades, affecting individuals of all ages and accounting for more than 1.3 million deaths worldwide. As such, the scientific community invested a lot of effort into better understanding its risk factors and mechanisms. Over the past few years, several studies have been conducted in animals and humans for this purpose, with the overall consensus that aggression can be precipitated by several risk factors, including biological and environmental. There is also evidence showing that aggression is linked with alcohol consumption and trauma exposure. However, despite significant progress in research, the mechanisms through which these factors lead to aggressive behaviors are poorly understood. This review provides the current state of knowledge regarding the neurobiology of aggression and highlights recent evidence discussing its relationship with alcohol and trauma. Abstract Aggression can be conceptualized as any behavior, physical or verbal, that involves attacking another person or animal with the intent of causing harm, pain or injury. Because of its high prevalence worldwide, aggression has remained a central clinical and public safety issue. Aggression can be caused by several risk factors, including biological and psychological, such as genetics and mental health disorders, and socioeconomic such as education, employment, financial status, and neighborhood. Research over the past few decades has also proposed a link between alcohol consumption and aggressive behaviors. Alcohol consumption can escalate aggressive behavior in humans, often leading to domestic violence or serious crimes. Converging lines of evidence have also shown that trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) could have a tremendous impact on behavior associated with both alcohol use problems and violence. However, although the link between trauma, alcohol, and aggression is well documented, the underlying neurobiological mechanisms and their impact on behavior have not been properly discussed. This article provides an overview of recent advances in understanding the translational neurobiological basis of aggression and its intricate links to alcoholism and trauma, focusing on behavior.

Interestingly, this association appears to be more pronounced in men than in women. Conversely, findings regarding serum triglycerides present a more nuanced picture, with some studies indicating heightened aggression with elevated levels and others suggesting the opposite. However, most studies have neglected to examine this phenomenon in conjunction with psychological traits. Additionally, no prior research has explored the association between serum lipid levels and different types of aggression, e.g., reactive, instrumental, or appetitive. Considering these gaps, our study aimed to assess serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels upon clinic admission and correlate them with scores from the Appetitive and Facilitative Aggression Scale (AFAS), a self-rating questionnaire assessing reactive and appetitive aggression. We conducted our investigation on a cohort of 135 forensic psychiatric patients undergoing drug addiction treatment under Section 64 of the German Criminal Code. This provision offers a nearly unique opportunity worldwide for individuals who have committed crimes under the influence of drugs or in the context of their addiction to receive specialized treatment. Using non-linear Spearman correlation analyses, we observed an inverse relationship between serum concentrations of both cholesterol and triglycerides and AFAS appetitive violence scores but not for reactive aggression.

Analyses tested diagnostic- and sex-based differences in suicidal thoughts and behaviors and nonsuicidal self-injury, and youth consistency in reporting across self- and clinician-rated measures. A greater proportion of autistic youth reported lifetime suicidal ideation (33 of 138, 23.9%) and nonsuicidal self-injury (12 of 138, 8.7%) than non-autistic youth (7 of 101, 6.9% suicidal ideation; 2 of 101, 2.0% nonsuicidal self-injury); however, there were no sex-based differences. Non-autistic youth were consistent in reporting suicidal thoughts across measures, but nearly one in five autistic youth disclosed suicidal thoughts on a self-report measure, but not on the clinician-rated Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale.

Previous literature has established a relationship between Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) and infidelity perpetration. As experiencing childhood adversity does not guarantee an individual will engage in infidelity, mechanisms explaining this relationship should be explored. We investigated whether avoidant and anxious attachment styles mediate the relationship between ACEs and cheating frequency. A sample of 584 participants aged 18-82\u2009years (M\u2009=\u200935.31, SD\u2009=\u200911.68, 67.0% female) was recruited and completed online versions of the Childhood Experiences Survey-17, the Relationship Structures Questionnaire, and frequency of cheating behavior in their current or most recent relationship. After dichotomizing gender and testing assumptions, data from 553 participants were available for analysis. A parallel mediation provided support for the first hypothesis, and partial support for the second. Specifically, ACEs were positively associated with anxious and avoidant attachment styles, but only avoidant attachment was significantly and positively associated with cheating frequency. As such, only avoidant attachment acted in a manner consistent with a mediator in the relationship between ACEs and infidelity. This result suggests a potential link between childhood adversity and the development of both avoidant and anxious attachment styles, but that individuals with an avoidant attachment style are more likely to engage in infidelity.

In other words, this study argues that the university plays a critical dual role in shaping the EI of students.

We presented a fairly general working memory task to 196 MTurk participants, 300 Prolific participants, and 255 students from the University of Geneva, allowing for a comparison of data quality across different participant pools. Among university students, 215 were web-tested, and 40 were lab-tested, allowing for a comparison of testing modalities within the same participant pool.

This study investigates the feasibility of online assessments for cognitive training studies by comparing training and transfer effects on task-order coordination (TOC) skills in laboratory versus online settings. Methods We conducted a 5-day training regimen including pre-and post-test. Sixty-two participants completed training either in our laboratory or online via Pavlovia. They were assigned to one of two training order conditions, either practicing two visual-manual tasks in a dual-task situation with fixed task order or with random task order. Performance metrics included reaction time (RT) and error rates for trained and untrained tasks to assess TOC costs before and after the training. Data from both setting conditions (laboratory vs. online) were compared. Results Firstly, data of both settings revealed training-order specific training and transfer effects for TOC costs on RT level. Random task order training improved TOC for trained and untrained tasks, whereas fixed order training did not. Secondly, cross-setting analyses, both frequentists and Bayesian, confirmed these effects and revealed no reliable impact of setting on outcomes. Discussion This research carries two significant implications. Our findings demonstrate the acquisition of task-order coordination skills, extending prior research on improving task-coordination in dual-task situations.

The primary focus is on how students can leverage their personal experiences and vitagenic learning to critically assess and interact with a wide array of media content in the current digital landscape. Background. As digital media and information become increasingly prevalent, students in higher education regularly encounter a significant volume of content that necessitates advanced critical evaluation skills. Vitagenic information, which refers to life experiences and practical knowledge, is essential in developing students' media literacy. By incorporating vitagenic learning, students gain the ability to discern credible information from misinformation, thereby improving their media engagement. Research Methods. The study employs a mixed-methods methodology, integrating both qualitative and quantitative data. Surveys were conducted with 200 university students to evaluate their existing media literacy levels and to determine how vitagenic experiences affect their critical thinking abilities. Additionally, focus groups were organized to collect detailed insights into how students utilize their vitagenic knowledge when consuming media. Results. Initial findings reveal a noteworthy relationship between students' personal experiences and their capacity for media analysis. Students with a robust background in vitagenic learning tend to achieve higher media literacy scores, especially in identifying biased or misleading content. Conclusion.

Patients with MDD were selected and matched 1:1 to those without MDD using exact matching. The rates of conversion from MDD to bipolar disorder (BD) or schizophrenia were also investigated. Results Overall, 471,773 patients were included in each of the matched MDD and non-MDD groups.

Grief \u2013 the cognitive, emotional, and behavioral responses to bereavement \u2013 is thus experienced by virtually everyone at some point in life, while mourning is a process through which grievers come to terms with the loss envisioning life without the deceased. Although distress subsides over time among most bereaved individuals, a minority will develop a condition recently identified as prolonged grief disorder (PGD). The present review provides a global perspective on bereavement, grief reactions, and PGD. Although the loss of a loved one and grief reactions are in general experienced consistently across different cultures, differences and variations in their expression may exist across cultures. Especially within specific populations that may be more at risk for PGD, possibly due to risk factors associated with the mechanisms of loss (e.g., refugees, migrants, and conflict survivors). The diagnostic criteria for PGD are mostly based on Western grieving populations, and cultural adaptations of PGD treatments are limited. Therefore, cross-cultural development and validation of PGD screening/assessment is critical to support future research on grief reactions and PGD, especially in non-Western contexts, and concerning the potential future global changes and challenges that appear to have a major impact on PGD. More transcultural research on PGD is needed to contextualize and will lead to culture-bound symptom identification of PGD, and the adaptation of current treatment protocols, which may ultimately improve health at the individual level, and health-care systems.", "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-06-20", "synthetic_support_claim": "Cross-cultural development and validation of PGD assessments are critical to support future research on grief.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Prolonged grief disorder (PGD) occurs equally across all cultures without any variation in its presentation."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "8dcdd2e03b4e8f1ad7d3112d29ce3a4598eeb8d5", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8dcdd2e03b4e8f1ad7d3112d29ce3a4598eeb8d5", "title": "Living with grief and thriving after loss: a qualitative study of Chinese parents whose only child has died", "abstract": "ABSTRACT Introduction: Chinese bereaved parents over the age of 49 who have lost their only child are known as shidu parents. This study aimed to explore their symptoms of prolonged grief disorder (PGD) and post-traumatic growth (PTG). Methods: Shidu parents who experienced the loss of their only child at least six months prior and had no biological or adopted children at the time of the study were recruited. Eleven shidu parents participated in individual interviews conducted in Mandarin via WeChat video or voice calls. The interview guide was developed by the first researcher and refined through discussions with doctoral students and a professor specializing in bereavement. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to analyse the data from the semi-structured interviews. Results: The interviewees (3 men and 8 women) were aged between 53 and 72 years, and the time since their child\u2019s loss ranged from 2.25 to 24 years. Four themes of PGD symptoms were identified: Separation distress, Cognitive, emotional, and behavioural symptoms, Somatic responses and Changes in grief responses. Subtheme of \u2018feelings of inferiority or shame\u2019 and \u2018somatic responses\u2019 were prominent among this group, potentially representing culturally relevant grief reactions. They also experienced genuine PTG that helped them adapt to life without the child: changes in self-perception, changes in interpersonal relationships, and a changed philosophy of life. The subtheme of \u2018living for self\u2019 emerged as a potentially unique PTG among shidu parents. Conclusion: Shidu parents share some important similarities with bereaved individuals across cultures, but also exhibit some unique characteristics. Considering their persistent intense grief, regular screening for grief severity, physical issues, and suicidal ideation is essential.

Objectives: This systematic review provides an overview of subacute effects of psychedelics. Methods: Electronic databases (MEDLINE, Web of Science Core Collection) were searched for studies that assessed the effects of psychedelics (LSD, psilocybin, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, mescaline, or ayahuasca) on psychological outcome measures and subacute adverse effects in human adults between 1950 and August 2021, occurring between 1 day and 1 month after drug use. Results: Forty-eight studies including a total number of 1,774 participants were eligible for review. Taken together, the following subacute effects were observed: reductions in different psychopathological symptoms; increases in wellbeing, mood, mindfulness, social measures, spirituality, and positive behavioral changes; mixed changes in personality/values/attitudes, and creativity/flexibility. Subacute adverse effects comprised a wide range of complaints, including headaches, sleep disturbances, and individual cases of increased psychological distress. Discussion: Results support narrative reports of a subacute psychedelic \u2018afterglow\u2019 phenomenon comprising potentially beneficial changes in the perception of self, others, and the environment.

Psilocybin induces dose-dependent transient (4-6 hours) usually pleasant changes in perception, cognition, and emotion by non-selectively agonizing the 5-HT2A receptors and negatively regulating serotonin reuptake, and long-term positive antidepressant effect on mood and well-being. Long-term effects are ascribed to the psychological quality of the acute experience, increase in synaptodensity and temporary (1-week) down-regulation of 5-HT2A receptors. Electroencephalography, a non-invasive neuroimaging tool, can track the acute effects of psilocybin; these include the suppression of alpha activity, decreased global connectivity, and increased brain entropy (i.e. brain signal diversity) in eyes-closed resting-state. However, few studies investigated how these modalities are affected together through the psychedelic experience. The current research aimed to evaluate the psilocybin intoxication temporal EEG profile. 20 healthy individuals (10 women) underwent oral administration of psilocybin (0.26 mg/kg) as part of a placebo-controlled cross-over study, resting-state 5-minute eyes closed EEG was obtained at baseline and 1, 1.5, 3, 6, and 24 hours after psilocybin administration. Absolute power, relative power spectral density (PSD), power envelope global functional connectivity (GFC), Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZ), and a Complexity via State-Space Entropy Rate (CSER) were obtained together with measures of subjective intensity of experience. Absolute power decreased in alpha and beta band, but increased in delta and gamma frequencies. 24h later was observed a broadband decrease. The PSD showed a decrease in alpha occipitally between 1 and 3 hours and a decrease in beta frontally at 3 hours, but power spectra distribution stayed the same 24h later. The GFC showed decrease acutely at 1, 1.5, and 3 hours in the alpha band. LZ and showed an increase at 1 and 1.5 hours. Decomposition of CSER into functional bands shows a decrease in alpha band but increase over higher frequencies. Further, complexity over a source space showed opposing changes in the Default Mode Network (DMN) and visual network between conditions, suggesting a relationship between signal complexity, stimulus integration, and perception of self. In an exploratory attempt, we found that a change in gamma GFC in DMN correlates with oceanic boundlessness. Psychological effects of psilocybin may be wrapped in personal interpretations and history unrelated to underlying neurobiological changes, but changes to perception of self may be bound to perceived loss of boundary based on whole brain synchrony with the DMN in higher frequency bands.", "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2024-09-11", "synthetic_support_claim": "Psilocybin leads to decreased alpha and beta absolute power and increased delta and gamma frequencies.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Psilocybin enhances cognitive performance in tasks requiring executive function and working memory."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "cfaa14b90c3e031bd8002f3334537a0d14d6de26", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cfaa14b90c3e031bd8002f3334537a0d14d6de26", "title": "Ayahuasca-assisted meaning reconstruction therapy for grief: a non-randomized clinical trial protocol", "abstract": "Background Psychotherapy for Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD), a condition characterized by an intense and persistent grief response, has received increased attention over the past decades. Evidence-based approaches to prevent PGD are currently scarce, and not always effective. This paper introduces a protocol for a clinical trial exploring the effectiveness of a Meaning Reconstruction psychotherapy approach (MR) assisted with ayahuasca, a traditional indigenous medicine. Method The outlined protocol is a three-arm, non-randomized controlled trial focused on reducing normal and pathological grief symptoms, comparing the effectiveness of Ayahuasca-assisted MR therapy (A-MR), MR therapy alone (MR) and No Treatment (NT). At least 69 people who lost a first-degree relative during the prior year, and with a Texas Revised Inventory of Grief score up 39 (TRIG \u2265 40), will participate in the trial. Participants will be allocated to an A-MR (n \u2265 23), MR (n \u2265 23) or NT (n \u2265 23) group. Those from the A-MR and MR therapy groups will undergo a therapeutic process involving 9 sessions of online psychotherapy. In addition, the A-MR condition involves 2 group sessions of ayahuasca. The primary outcomes will be normal and pathological grief severity as measured by the TRIG and Traumatic Grief Inventory Self-Report (TGI-SR), administered at baseline, post-treatment, and 3-month follow up. Measures of quality of life, post-traumatic growth, meaning-made, psychological flexibility, and self-belief consistency will be also included. In addition, subjective effects of ayahuasca and acceptance-avoidance promoting effects will be assessed following ayahuasca administration. Finally, we will analyze the potential mediating effect of meaning-made, psychological flexibility and self-belief consistency in grief symptoms (as measured by the TRIG and TGI).

The climate is a complex system and scientists are striving to predict, prevent, and address the aforementioned issues in order to avoid reaching tipping points. The threat to humankind is not only physical (ie, heat waves, floods, droughts) but also psychological, especially for some groups. Insecurity, danger, chaos, and an unstable system due to climate change have both short- and long-term psychological effects. In this scenario, the need for new psychological categories is emerging, namely, eco-emotions and psychoterratic syndromes which include eco-anxiety, ecological grief, climate worry, and climate trauma. This paper focuses on these new categories, presenting a summary of each one, including definitions, hypotheses, questions, and testological evaluations, as a useful tool to be consulted by researchers and clinicians and to help them in the therapeutic work. Also, this paper endeavors to distinguish between a psychological stress resulting in a positive outcome, such as pro-environmental behavior, compared to a stress that leads to a psychopathology. Prevention and intervention strategies including social and community support are fundamental to help cope with and mitigate the effect of climate change on mental health.

This study aimed to validate an Italian version of the Eating-Related Eco-Concern Questionnaire (EREC), a brief unidimensional measure of eating behaviors related to eco-concern. Methods Six hundred and sixty-three adults (85% females, mean age 37 \u00b1 12 years) completed the EREC, Climate Change Worry Scale (CCWS), Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire (EDE-Q), Eating Habits Questionnaire for orthorexia nervosa symptoms (EHQ-21), and questions on dietary habits and motivations, and past experiences of extreme climate events. Results Confirmatory factor analysis results indicated that the original one-factor model showed acceptable fit to the data after including the error covariation between two pairs of items. Internal consistency was adequate, and EREC scores correlated positively and strongly with CCWS scores. Participants scored significantly lower in EREC than in CCWS, indicating greater climate-related concerns in general terms than relating specifically to eating. While EREC was unrelated to EDE-Q scores, weak-to-moderate correlations were observed with EHQ-21 subscale and total scores. Pro-environmental and/or ethical reasons for current diet and personal experience of extreme climate events were associated with significantly higher EREC scores. Discussion The Italian EREC appears to be a valid and reliable tool for the screening of eating-related concerns and behaviors related to climate change.

Evidence increasingly links these factors to higher rates of suicide-related outcomes, including suicidal ideation, attempts, and self-harm. Such interactions underscore the importance of understanding how climate-driven mental health risks vary by environmental factor and gender, as gender-specific vulnerabilities shape responses to climate stressors. Methods By April 16, 2024, we conducted a comprehensive search of PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, Scopus, ProQuest, and Embase. Two researchers independently reviewed studies and collected demographic data, systematically tracking and recording rates of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, suicide deaths, self-harm, and anxiety. Data were rigorously cross-verified for accuracy and consistency. Results The meta-analysis demonstrated significant associations between climate change variables and mental health outcomes. High temperatures and air pollution were linked to increased suicide attempts (OR: 1.40, 95% CI: 1.34\u20131.45) and suicide deaths (OR: 1.51, 95% CI: 1.44\u20131.58), particularly among males. Conversely, atmospheric pollution and desertification correlated with a reduced likelihood of suicidal ideation (OR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.63\u20130.85). These findings highlight gender-specific mental health impacts, with females exhibiting higher rates of anxiety and self-harm, underscoring the urgent need for targeted interventions addressing climate-induced mental health risks. Conclusions This systematic review and meta-analysis reveal significant gender-specific mental health impacts of climate change, with females experiencing higher rates of anxiety, self-harm, and suicidal ideation, while males show greater incidences of suicide attempts and deaths. These findings emphasize the urgent need for targeted interventions and the integration of mental health services into climate policies to address these gender disparities.

Under the guidance of Erikson's self-identity theory, the study contributes to the extension of Erikson's self-identity theory in the context of East Asia as a case study. Applying qualitative methods, the study collects data through 13 in-depth interviews with participants with different educational levels, leading to the discussion in the context of Chinese social characteristics. The findings show that players with lower educational backgrounds are more inclined to explore diverse occupational roles in the game and are more attracted to roles with power. On the contrary, players with higher educational backgrounds tend to map out clearer career paths and regard gaming primarily as an emotional connection rather than career exploration. When it comes to intimacy, players with higher education prioritize emotional bonds and choose characters that fit the values of depth and stability. Meanwhile, the other group in this study prefer characters of higher economic or social status, reflecting traditional ideals of security and support. The study bridges the gap between Erikson's theory of self-identity as applied in the East Asian context and the lack of education level as a variable to be discussed in the field of Otome games.

Similar to previous findings, we found significant age effects: CC and global efficiency were lower, and modularity was higher, for older adults. Furthermore, vocabulary knowledge was significantly related to the semantic memory network measures: corresponding with the age effects, CC and global efficiency had a negative relationship, while modularity had a positive relationship with vocabulary knowledge. More generally, vocabulary knowledge significantly increased with age, which may reflect the critical role that the accumulation of knowledge within semantic memory has on its structure.

The current study examined the impact of sustained preschool attendance, parental stress, and parental mental health on internalizing and externalizing problems during COVID-19 lockdown measures in a sample of preschool children in Germany. Methods and findings N = 128 parents of preschool children filled out a one-time online survey about children\u2019s internalizing problems, externalizing problems, and attachment for three time points: before a nation-wide lockdown (T1), during the most difficult time of the lockdown (T2) and after the lockdown (T3). Additionally, parents answered questions about their own depressive and anxious symptomatology for the three time points and parental stress for T1 and T2. Linear-mixed effect models were computed to predict children\u2019s internalizing / externalizing behavior. Preschool children showed a significant increase in internalizing and externalizing problems over time, highest at T2 with small decreases at T3. Parental depressive and anxious symptomatology increased significantly from T1 to T2, but also remained high at T3. Parental stress levels were comparable to community samples at T1, but attained average values reported for at-risk families at T2. Linear-mixed effect models identified higher parental stress, parental anxiety, attachment problems, parental education, and less preschool attendance as significant predictors for internalizing and externalizing problems in preschoolers with more specific associations shown in separate models.

Design This is a cross-sectional study. Setting This study used stratified whole-cluster sampling to randomly select three elementary schools within Ezhou City. Participants An online survey was administered to the parents of students in one or two classes in grades 1\u20136, respectively, of each school. Among them, males account for 30.4% and females account for 69.6%. The inclusion criteria included (1) the parent or legal guardian of a primary school student or a person directly responsible for the child\u2019s education and (2) the ability to operate a computer or smartphone to complete the survey.

Based on an effect analysis drawn from 131 studies and 147 samples, comprising 47,348 participants, the relationships between knowledge hiding and different antecedent and consequence categories are examined. The results generally support expected relationships across the vast majority of categories of knowledge-hiding antecedents, including job characteristics, leadership, attitudes and motivations, working context, personality, and individual differences. Knowledge hiding is related to outcomes, including creativity, task performance, incivility, deviance, and deterioration of workplace behavior. We also provide comprehensive empirical evidence to support the conceptual claim that knowledge hiding is not correlated with knowledge sharing.

Furthermore, the study reveals the mediating roles of job crafting and work withdrawal, highlighting the distinct mechanisms involved with these stressors. Specifically, challenge stressors increase the likelihood of knowledge hiding through work withdrawal while simultaneously decreasing it through job crafting; notably, the former pathway has a greater effect. In contrast, hindrance stressors consistently exert detrimental effects, amplifying the probability of knowledge hiding through both mediators, which explains their stronger impact compared to challenge stressors. Additionally, empowering leadership plays a crucial moderating role in this relationship. The adverse influence of hindrance stressors on knowledge hiding, as mediated by job crafting, intensifies under high levels of empowering leadership.

The Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) was used to gauge each incident's socioeconomic context and assess correlations between SVI scores and the likelihood of opioid-related activations and naloxone interventions.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 7,789 pediatric opiate-related EMS activations were identified. Lower socioeconomic status (SES) areas (higher SVI scores) exhibited a decreased rate of opioid-related activations compared to lower SVI-scored areas but an increased frequency of naloxone administration. The analysis demonstrated that as socioeconomic status (SES) improves, the likelihood of opioid-related activations increases significantly supported by a significant negative linear trend (Estimate\u2009=\u2009-0.2971, SE = 0.1172, z\u2009=\u2009-2.54, p\u2009=\u20090.0112.

In fact, high-functioning ASD individuals were reported to be more aware of their communication difficulties and were more likely make considerable efforts to adjust their behavior to conventional rules of non-autistic individuals, learning to imitate other non-ASD individuals. Moreover, females reported a higher frequency of camouflaging strategies, suggesting a role of camouflaging in the gender gap of the ASD diagnosis. Although camouflaging strategies can sometimes grant a better level of adjustment, even resulting in a hyper-adaptive behavior, they are also often correlated with negative mental health consequences due to the long-term stress associated with continuous attempts to adapt in day-to-day life.

Although the literature available on the topic is still scarce, some interesting correlations between camouflaging and anxious and depressive symptoms, as well as suicidality, were highlighted.

Growing attention has been paid to the presence of problematic Internet use (PIU) in autistic individuals. Studies assessing OCD traits in autistic individuals are scarce and even less take into account the role that this overlap may have on the development and maintenance of PIU. We aimed to investigate OCD features in ASD individuals and their association with autism severity and the prevalence of PIU, and the potential dimensions associated with a greater probability of PIU. Methods: a total of 46 participants with ASD and 53 controls were assessed with the Adult Autism Subthreshold Spectrum questionnaire and the Obsessive\u2013Compulsive Spectrum\u2014Short Version. Results: There were significantly higher OCD features in ASD participants along with important correlations between OCD and ASD dimensions and a higher prevalence of PIU in the ASD group. Participants with putative PIU reported greater scores on some ASD and OCD dimensions, the with Doubt and Non-verbal communication domains emerging as significant predictors of the presence of putative PIU.

Standard psychological interventions, such as applied behaviour analysis (ABA) and social skill training (SST), are commonly used but remain controversial due to their focus on aligning autistic individuals with societal norms.This paper critically evaluates standard approaches targeting core autistic traits and explores the therapeutic potential of prioritising comorbidities coherently with neurodiversity\u2010affirming strategies.A critical analysis of clinical and empirical literature was conducted to evaluate the efficacy, ethical issues and broader implications of interventions such as ABA and SST. Particular emphasis was placed on synthesising findings relevant to mental health outcomes, autistic identity formation and the potential of neurodiversity\u2010affirming interventions to reduce distress and promote well\u2010being.Standard approaches often contribute to adverse effects, such as social camouflaging and increased mental health challenges. Conversely, interventions addressing comorbid conditions such as depression and anxiety, combined with neurodiversity\u2010affirming strategies that support autistic identity and adapt the environment, demonstrate improved mental health outcomes and greater self\u2010acceptance.We highlight the importance of shifting the therapeutic focus from modifying core autistic traits to addressing comorbidities while fostering a coherent autistic identity. Such a dual approach aligns with the neurodiversity paradigm and emphasises the need for interventions that enhance well\u2010being by reducing distress caused by comorbid conditions without suppressing autistic characteristics.Prioritising comorbid conditions while fostering autistic identity through neurodiversity\u2010affirming strategies offers a more ethical and effective approach to improving mental health and self\u2010acceptance in autistic individuals.

This study investigates the characteristics, methods, and triggering events associated with suicidal behaviors among students in Bangladesh during the post\u2010pandemic period (2022\u20132023). Methods Data were collected from 150 online newspaper portals in Bangladesh, covering student suicides from 2022 to 2023. Variables such as causes, methods, timing, location, sex, age, and education level were analyzed using Microsoft Excel, SPSS, and ArcGIS. Results A total of 984 student suicide cases were identified. Females accounted for 61% of the cases, while males represented 39%, indicating a higher vulnerability among female students. The majority of cases (72.5%) involved students aged 13\u201319 years, followed by those aged 20\u201325 years (18.4%). Secondary school students represented 44.9% of the cases, with 7.2% from madrasahs. Hanging was the most common method (79.7%). Major causes included emotional distress (28%), romantic relationship issues (19.5%), academic pressure (8.4%), family problems (8.1%), mental instability (7%), and sexual harassment (3.3%).
