We confirm key predictions of our agency model: following the tax cut, moderate insider-ownership firms experience larger declines in their responsibility ratings and increases in their valuations relative to other firms.

Sustainable business practices are measured by ESG composite scores and individual environmental, social, and governance scores. Profitability is represented by return on equity and return on assets. Utilizing the Panel Corrected Standard Error technique to address data issues like autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity, the study finds that sustainable business practices insignificantly impact profitability. However, the social pillar has a significantly positive correlation with return on assets, with each unit improvement in the social score resulting in a 0.1323 increase in return. Conversely, the governance pillar negatively impacts return on assets, with each unit increase in governance score resulting in a decrease of 0.1527 units in profitability. Interestingly, larger companies experienced reduced returns on both assets and equity, as financial risk also lowered returns.

Theoretical reasoning Presidential elections that shift control of the White House often alter CEOs\u2019 alignment with the presidency, influencing their motivations to invest in CSR. Firms with CEOs aligned with the newly elected president (newly aligned firms) may anticipate economic benefits, such as favorable regulation, but also face increased public scrutiny. The enhanced operating environment may reduce their incentives to use CSR to mitigate product market, litigation, and capital market pressures. Conversely, heightened scrutiny may prompt their greater CSR investment. Firms with CEOs aligned with the outgoing president (newly unaligned firms) encounter directionally opposite incentives, for example, reduced economic benefits from connection with power and lower scrutiny. Both groups of politically active firms may benefit from superior access to legislative information following the transition of power. The test hypotheses We state our hypotheses in the null form, predicting that there is no difference in the postelection change of CSR performance between newly aligned (newly unaligned) firms and nonpartisan firms whose CEO political alignment with the White House did not change as a result of the 2008 or 2016 elections. Target population Our sample consists of 12,234 firm-year observations drawn from the three-year periods immediately surrounding the 2008 and 2016 elections and includes 2086 (1935) firm-year observations with newly aligned (newly unaligned) CEOs and 8213 cases with nonpartisan CEOs. Adopted methodology We employed a difference-in-differences research design to examine the difference in CSR performance between the pre-election period (the election year \u22123 to \u22121) and the postelection period (the election year +1 to +3) in newly aligned (newly unaligned) firms relative to firms with nonpartisan CEOs. Analyses and findings We found that both newly aligned and newly unaligned firms significantly improved their CSR performance following elections where control of the White House changes, relative to nonpartisan firms. This association is more pronounced for less financially constrained firms and those in politically sensitive industries. Further analysis shows that newly aligned firms enhance CSR to mitigate public scrutiny and leverage superior legislative information, while newly unaligned firms invest in CSR to reduce their cost of capital and litigation risk.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-01", "synthetic_support_claim": "Both newly aligned and newly unaligned firms significantly improved their CSR performance following presidential elections.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "CEOs\u2019 political alignment with the White House directly determines a firm's overall financial performance."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "cf5708c7987c1b38bc7c5053b9d6094dec57834a", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cf5708c7987c1b38bc7c5053b9d6094dec57834a", "title": "Climate Change Concerns and the Performance of Green vs. Brown Stocks", "abstract": "We empirically test the prediction of P\u00e1stor et al. (2021) that green firms outperform brown firms when concerns about climate change increase unexpectedly, using data for S&P 500 companies from January 2010 to June 2018. To capture unexpected increases in climate change concerns, we construct a daily Media Climate Change Concerns index using news about climate change published by major U.S. newspapers and newswires. We find that on days with an unexpected increase in climate change concerns, the green firms\u2019 stock prices tend to increase, whereas brown firms\u2019 prices decrease. Furthermore, using topic modeling, we conclude that this effect holds for concerns about both transition and physical climate change risk. Finally, we decompose returns into cash flow and discount rate news components and find that an unexpected increase in climate change concerns is associated with an increase (decrease) in the discount rate of brown (green) firms.

In our co-occurrence analysis, we focus on companies that share the same emotion on the same day, using a much shorter horizon than our previous study of one month. This approach allows us to uncover short-term, emotion-driven correlations that traditional models might overlook. By analyzing these co-occurrence networks, Fin-ALICE identifies hidden connections between companies, sectors, and events. Supply chain analysis within Fin-ALICE will evaluate significant events in commodity-producing countries that impact their ability to supply key resources. This analysis captures the ripple effects of disruptions across industries and regions, offering a more nuanced prediction of market movements. Emotional sentiment analysis, powered by the Fin-Emotion library developed in our prior research, quantifies the emotional undertones in financial news through metrics like \u201cemotion magnitude\u201d and \u201cemotion interaction\u201d. These insights, when integrated with Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs), significantly enhance the accuracy of financial forecasts by capturing the emotional drivers of market sentiment. Key contributions of Fin-ALICE include its ability to perform month-by-month company correlation analysis, capturing short-term market fluctuations and seasonal patterns. We compare the performance of TCNs against advanced models such as LLMs and LSTMs, demonstrating that the Fin-ALICE model outperforms these models, particularly in sectors where emotional sentiment and supply chain dynamics are critical.

It addresses the critical need to improve employee retention and organizational performance in a context marked by economic instability and political uncertainty. By analyzing data from 270 health-care professionals, the study aims to explore how different aspects of organizational culture - such as transparency, supportiveness and ethical leadership - affect employee trust and satisfaction. These factors, in turn, play a significant role in enhancing employee loyalty, which is crucial for reducing turnover and ensuring the stability of health-care services.\n\n\nDESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH\nThe research used a quantitative methodology, gathering data from 270 health-care professionals across various private health-care institutions in Lebanon. A structured survey was used, and responses were analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM) to test the proposed hypotheses. The SEM approach was chosen for its ability to evaluate both measurement and structural models, ensuring robust validation of the theoretical framework. Partial least squares (PLS-SEM) was specifically applied, given its suitability for smaller sample sizes and complex models. After screening and cleaning the data, the final sample size was 270, ensuring a representative and accurate analysis.\n\n\nFINDINGS\nThe research findings reveal that a strong organizational culture significantly enhances employee loyalty, mediated by higher levels of trust and job satisfaction. Cultures characterized by transparency, supportiveness and ethical leadership are shown to build trust among employees, which directly contributes to greater job satisfaction. This satisfaction, in turn, plays a crucial role in strengthening employee loyalty, helping to reduce turnover rates and maintain organizational stability. The study underscores the importance of fostering a positive corporate culture as a strategic tool in health-care settings, particularly in challenging environments like Lebanon, to improve both employee engagement and overall performance.\n\n\nORIGINALITY/VALUE\nThis study offers originality by focusing on the underexplored Lebanese health-care sector, particularly in the context of organizational culture's impact on employee loyalty, trust and job satisfaction. While much research has been conducted in more stable economies, this study addresses the unique socio-economic challenges faced by health-care institutions in Lebanon, including political instability and economic volatility.

Understanding how appetitive traits differ between plant-based and animal-based diets can provide insights into dietary strategies for weight management and improved health. Objectives: The aim of this study was to analyse the relationships between appetitive traits, as measured by the Adult Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (AEBQ), and dietary patterns in adults consuming plant-based or animal-based diets. It examined how these dietary patterns influence body mass index (BMI) and explored the differences in appetite-related traits between groups with different levels of plant and animal product consumption. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 553 Polish adults was conducted using validated questionnaires, including the AEBQ and a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). The participants were categorised into four dietary groups: high intake of both plant and animal products, low intake of both, plant-based diet, and animal-based diet.

Industry\u2019s AI successes are easy to see on the news, but those headlines are the heralds of a much larger, more systematic shift as industry increasingly dominates the three key ingredients of modern AI research: computing power, large datasets, and highly skilled researchers.

The first purpose is to characterize female users who use this platform to share content around this area. The second is to identify the most prominent themes among female users\u2019 digital production of gender inequality concepts, applied to AI technologies.Design/methodology/approachSocial opinion mining has been applied to historical Twitter data. Data were gathered using a combination of analytical methods such as word clouds, sentiment analyses and clustering. It examines 172,041 tweets worldwide over a limited period of 359\u00a0days.FindingsEmpirical data gathered from interactions of female users in digital dialogues highlight that the most prominent topics of interest are the future of AI technologies and the active role of women to guarantee gender balanced systems. Algorithmic bias impacts female user behaviours in response to injustice and inequality in algorithmic outcomes. They share topics of interest and lead constructive conversations with profiles affiliated with gender or race empowerment associations. Women challenged by stereotypes and prejudices are likely to fund entrepreneurial solutions to create opportunities for change.Research limitations/implicationsThis study does have its limitations, however. First, different keywords are likely to result in a different pool of related research. Moreover, due to the nature of our sample, the largest proportion of posts are from native English speakers, predominantly (88%) from the US, UK, Australia and Canada. This demographic concentration reflects specific social structures and practices that influence gender equity priorities within the sample. These cultural contexts, which often emphasize inclusivity and equity, play a significant role in shaping the discourse around gender issues. These cultural norms, preferences and practices are critical in understanding the individual behaviours, perspectives and priorities expressed in the posts; in other words, it is vital to consider cultural context and economic determinants in an analysis of gender equity discussions. The US, UK, Australia and Canada share a cultural and legal heritage, a common language, values, democracy and the rule of law. Bennett (2007) emphasizes the potential for enhanced cooperation in areas like technology, trade and security, suggesting that the anglosphere\u2019s cultural and institutional commonalities create a natural foundation for a cohesive, influential global network. These shared characteristics further influence the common approaches and perspectives on gender equity in public discourse. Yet findings from Western nations should not be assumed to apply easily to the contexts of other countries.Practical implicationsFrom a practical perspective, the results help us understand the role of female influencers and scrutinize public conversations. From a theoretical one, this research upholds the argument that feminist critical thought is indispensable in the development of balanced AI systems.Social implicationsThe results also help us understand the role of female influencers: ordinary individuals often challenged by gender and race discrimination. They request an intersectional, collaborative and pluralistic understanding of gender and race in AI. They act alone and endure the consequences of stigmatized products and services. AI curators should strongly consider advocating for responsible, impartial technologies, recognizing the indispensable role of women. This must consider all stakeholders, including representatives from industry, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), civil society and academia.Originality/valueThis study aims to fill critical research gaps by addressing the lack of a socio-technical perspective on AI-based decision-making systems, the shortage of empirical studies in the field and the need for a critical analysis using feminist theories.

Data were collected using a set of questionnaires returned by employees who use AI-based financial tools to analyze data using descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, regression analysis, and independent t-tests. The outcomes for the three dependent variables support the notion that more frequent use and personalization of AI tools significantly reduce financial stress (t = -6.35, p < 0.01), improve financial literacy (r = 0.592, p < 0.01), as well as increase job satisfaction and productivity (r = 0.564 and r = 0.478, p < 0.01). Moreover, the multiple regression revealed that both frequency of usage of AI tools and personalization were excellent predictors of reduced financial stress (B = -0.221, p = 0.005; B = -0.324, p = 0.000). Thus, all four hypotheses are supported to demonstrate that AI tools help reduce the stress related to finances and improve work-related outcomes as well as the financial well-being of the employees. The findings here suggest that only customized AI programs are effective in detailing financial issues and have the potential for scaling their implementations within workplaces as well as cost-efficient solutions to improve overall employee welfare.

Theorizing the Role of Human-Like Competencies in Conversational Artificial Intelligence Agents", "abstract": "ABSTRACT Driven by the need to provide continuous, timely, and efficient customer service, firms are constantly experimenting with emerging technological solutions. In recent times firms have shown an increased interest in designing and implementing artificial intelligence (AI)-based interactional technologies, such as conversational AI agents and chatbots, that obviate the need for having human service agents for the provision of customer service. However, the business impact of conversational AI is contingent on customers using and adequately engaging with these tools. This engagement depends, in turn, on conversational AI\u2019s similarity, or likeness to the human beings it is intended to replace. Businesses therefore need to understand what human-like characteristics and competencies should be embedded in customer-facing conversational AI agents to facilitate smooth user interaction. This focus on \u201chuman-likeness\u201d for facilitating user engagement in the case of conversational AI agents is in sharp contrast to most prior information systems (IS) user engagement research, which is predicated on the \u201cinstrumental value\u201d of information technology (IT). Grounding our work in the individual human competency and media naturalness literatures, we theorize the key role of human-like interactional competencies in conversational AI agents\u2014specifically, cognitive, relational, and emotional competencies\u2014in facilitating user engagement. We also hypothesize the mediating role of user trust in these relationships. Following a sequential mixed methods approach, we use a quantitative two-wave, survey-based study to test our model. We then examine the results in light of findings from qualitative follow-up interviews with a sampled set of conversational AI users. Together, the results offer a nuanced understanding of desirable human-like competencies in conversational AI agents and the salient role of user trust in fostering user engagement with them. We also discuss the implications of our study for research and practice.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-10-02", "synthetic_support_claim": "Human-like interactional competencies in conversational AI agents facilitate user engagement through mediating user trust.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "AI-based interactional technologies will completely replace human service agents in customer service in the near future."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "c64a1595dec7d40e7b8e40e9dab2568a1caeb713", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c64a1595dec7d40e7b8e40e9dab2568a1caeb713", "title": "Inferring human vision in a human-like way: Key factors influencing the cognitive processing of level-1 visual perspective-taking", "abstract": "The advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has expanded the potential for human-machine communication and collaboration in complex contexts, necessitating AI to exhibit human-like behavior in order to align with its human counterpart. Consequently, understanding human behavioral traits becomes advantageous for developing AI agents that resemble humans. This study investigated how individuals process visual information from others to inform the future design of intelligent vision systems.

This study aims to examine the impact of digitalization on green innovation by analyzing its interactions with micro and macro factors.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThis paper adopts a multi-level perspective (MLP) with a multi-agent framework to study how different factors impact green innovation efficiency. This paper uses fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) on 30 Chinese provinces from 2012 to 2021 to identify key conditions and pathways for green innovation efficiency.\n\nFindings\nThe findings reveal that digitalization alone does not constitute a necessary condition for green innovation. Rather, digitalization needs to be configured with other factors to form dynamic causal paths. In 2012\u20132016, a single path type (digitalization coupled with regional innovation and marketization) exists. In 2017\u20132021, two causal path types [digitalization and foreign direct investment (FDI), digitalization and regional innovation] emerge.\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nThe study has three theoretical contributions. First, while previous research studies often focus on single factors, the study examines the complexity of green innovation from a configurational perspective. Using the fsQCA method, this paper explores complex interactions and asymmetric causal relationships among multi-level factors. Second, this paper presents a novel theoretical framework that integrates the MLP framework with the multi-agent framework, facilitating a multi-dimensional analysis of green innovation. This synthesis elucidates the complex network of relationships, interactions and dependencies that propel green innovation. Third, responding to the call in international dynamic QCA research, this paper uses the multi-period QCA method. This allows for a detailed stage-by-stage comparative analysis, elucidating green innovation paths and revealing evolutionary trends of \u201cconfigurational diversity\u201d and \u201cfactor concentration.\u201d This research offers practical insights for policymakers and stakeholders to develop more effective, tailored strategies for promoting green innovation.\n\nPractical implications\nDigitalization alone cannot fully drive green innovation; it must be combined with factors such as marketization, regional innovation and FDI. To achieve this, promote market-oriented reforms to enhance market mechanisms and encourage participation in green innovation projects through incentives. Increase investment in regional innovation, establish platforms for resource sharing and technological exchange and support cooperation between local governments and businesses. Additionally, it attracts FDI by creating favorable policies and a conducive business environment. Adapting policies to evolving conditions is crucial. Regularly assess and update policies to ensure their effectiveness and relevance in the face of changing technological and market landscapes. Optimize approval processes, reduce bureaucratic hurdles and improve policy implementation efficiency. Regions should also tailor strategies to their specific needs: those with high digitalization but lacking FDI should focus on building a robust research and development (R&D) personnel base, while regions with high FDI but insufficient local talent should attract skilled professionals through talent attraction programs and partnerships with international universities. Continuously adapting strategies ensures that regions can effectively drive sustainable development and green innovation.\n\nSocial implications\nThe research advances the understanding of green innovation by examining multi-level configuration effects, introducing an integrated framework and conducting stage-by-stage comparative analysis. These contributions collectively enhance the theoretical foundation and practical applicability of promoting green innovation in an increasingly digitalized world.\n\nOriginality/value\nThis study offers invaluable theoretical insights and practical pathways for policymakers and decision-makers, providing tailored strategies to promote green innovation. By understanding the complex interactions between digitalization and other factors, decision-makers can better leverage digitalization for sustainable development and environmental protection.\n", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-01-16", "synthetic_support_claim": "Digitalization alone is insufficient for green innovation; it needs integration with factors like marketization and FDI.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Digitalization is the sole driving factor for achieving high levels of green innovation efficiency."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "149561976e696c1f80a710e0a8db3201d8fa5b74", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/149561976e696c1f80a710e0a8db3201d8fa5b74", "title": "The Impact of Trust-Building Mechanisms on Purchase Intention towards Metaverse Shopping: The Moderating Role of Age", "abstract": "Abstract Given the uncertainty of online transactions in metaverse shopping, the digital economy encourages building a trustworthy virtual environment.

Study 1 compared eco-friendly storytelling with product-focused storytelling, considering perceived product aesthetic judgment as the moderator. Study 2 repeated the experiment with a founder story and a product-focused story, considering the perceived underdog as the moderator.FindingsThe findings suggest that the influence of eco-friendly storytelling, compared to product-focused storytelling, on higher purchase intention is fully mediated by brand trust.

The advent of the circular economy (CE) in this post-pandemic era has brought unpredictable sustainable challenges for the manufacturing industries. This research paper aims to bring more clarity to the extant literature on the relationship between environmental innovation (EI) and CE.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nIn this study, a systematic literature review methodology was used to research the determinants of EI in the knowledge environment that drives the implementation of a CE.\n\n\nFindings\nThis paper proposes a framework that articulates organizational learning and orientation dynamics and offers a new set of internal knowledge resources for a corporate CE. It is found that change toward CE requires connection with EI. However, successful CE growth largely depends on leveraging knowledge resources and orientation dynamics (stakeholder orientation, sustainability orientation, organization learning orientation and entrepreneurial orientation). CE techniques are still in their early phases of adoption and their implementation is still in its development. Circular knowledge economy (CKE) has the potential to be a useful alternative to achieving thriving CE to achieve sustainability in local and global businesses operations.\n\n\nPractical implications\nThis study helps companies to understand the organizational learning and different orientation dynamics for achieving CE principles. The research findings imply that EI is critical in establishing a sustainable transition toward CE through organizational learning and orientation dynamics and has garnered significant attention from academics, public policymakers and practitioners. The proposed framework can guide managers to develop sustainable policies related to the CE. This research recognizes that firm-level CKE is important in shaping how knowledge resources relate to CE within transition management literature.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThis paper abridges the knowledge gap in identifying key drivers and presents the current eminence, challenges and prognostications of sustainable EI parameters in the changing climate of CE. This study builds a framework that combines insights from different viewpoints and disciplines and extends one\u2019s understanding of the relationship between EI and CE. From a theoretical perspective, this study explains the knowledge management complexity links between EI and CE. It builds a theoretical bridge between EI and CE to illustrate how firms transition toward CE following the recommendations.

Qualitative research methods are used to explore the paradoxical tensions and dynamic capabilities involved in the process.\n\nFindings\nThe study finds that incumbent firms face numerous challenges and paradoxical tensions in the CBMI process. These tensions arise from difficulties in implementing organizational changes, balancing competing priorities and managing conflicting goals. Dynamic capabilities are crucial in managing these tensions and facilitating the transition to a circular business model.\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nThis paper contributes to the theoretical development of paradox theory by applying it to the new field of CBMI which is currently slightly investigated and responds to the call for studies looking at more fine-grained types of sustainable business models. The study adds to previous literature that how the firm handles paradoxes and tensions influences the pace and results of the process. If the firm becomes discouraged during the early stages of identifying new opportunities, the pace slows down, and the firm becomes hesitant to collaborate more with partners. Furthermore, the ability to capitalize on these opportunities is affected by these tensions and contradictions.\n\nOriginality/value\nThis paper contributes to the literature by empirically investigating the process of CBMI in incumbent firms. It fills the gap in existing research by examining the existence of paradoxical tensions in a real-life setting and exploring the role of dynamic capabilities in managing these tensions.

Our results indicate while base model fine-tuning led to greater degradation, instruction-tuned models maintained more robust performance. To address this degradation, we employed model merging techniques, integrating single-task domain-specific fine-tuned models with the base model.

The distribution of AI and related information in the textual data of the annual report is examined using content analysis. The disclosure of AI-related terminology has been expanding gradually since 2014, according to a regression study of 115 annual reports covering the years 2014-2021 from 15 Jordanian banks listed on the Amman Stock Exchange. However, it appears that Jordanian financial institutions are only dabbling in AI, as some of them have disclosed very little. According to the results, institutions' financial performance is affected by the release of AI-related terminology. This confirms what some have suspected all along: that accounting performance is enhanced by AI in terms of ROA and ROE, while costs are reduced in all other areas. Additionally, it supports the widely held view that AI may boost profits while decreasing expenses. In a number of ways, this research adds to the expanding canon of artificial intelligence literature, particularly that which deals with AI voluntary disclosure. First, it gauges the current state of AI adoption in practice by creating an AI disclosure index, which gives an objective measurement of AI's usage. Secondly, it sheds light on how financial performance relates to AI disclosure. As a third point, it emphasises the necessity for disclosure guidance rules and backs the work of legislators, international authorities, and supervisory organisations to confront AI disclosure challenges.

It is for this reason that the idea of strategic outsourcing has evolved in response to changes in the business environment and uncertainty. Despite vast empirical research on the relationship between strategic outsourcing and firm performance, there is limited research on influence of strategic outsourcing on firm performance in developing countries. the majority of studies on the subject have contradictory results, and some have methodological, contextual, and conceptual gaps. Thus, there is currently conflicting evidence from the body of literature regarding the impact of strategic outsourcing and firm performance generally, so this research was necessary. The general objective of this study is to review conceptual, theoretical as well as empirical literature on the relationship between strategic outsourcing and, firm performance as well as the mediating effect of speed of service and moderating effect of competitive intensity on the relationship with the view of highlighting the knowledge gaps suitable to form basis for future research. The review of conceptual framework highlighted the historical development as well as the dimensions and perspectives of both strategic outsourcing and firm performance. It further discussed the speed of service delivery concept and the competitive intensity. The underpinning theories were; Resource Based Theory, Transaction Cost Economics Theory, Social Exchange Theory. The paper further reviewed extant empirical research on the manner in which strategic outsourcing relates to firm performance. It also reviewed focus as mediating variable and competitive intensity as moderator of relationships. Based on findings, the paper; proposed theoretical model to explain firm performance in terms of the indicators of strategic outsourcing and mediated by focus while it moderated by competitive intensity. In accordance with the reviewed literature, this paper concludes that service integration and management, offshore outsourcing, and multi-sourcing as measures of strategic outsourcing affect firm performance which is measured firm efficiency, firm profitability, competitive advantage, customer satisfaction and employee productivity.

To explore the role of digital marketing outsourcing as an effective tool for cost optimization, enhancing competitiveness, and achieving strategic goals for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Special attention is given to analyzing the results of a survey of entrepreneurs who have experience using this strategy. \nDesign/Methodology/Approach. The study is exploratory in nature and is based on general scientific methods such as description, comparison, analysis, and specification. A comparative approach was employed to identify key aspects of the digital marketing outsourcing market, including popular areas of transferring functions to external management. Additionally, modern management approaches, such as Agile, Lean, and Data-driven marketing, were analyzed, highlighting their role in ensuring the efficiency of this strategy in the context of global competition. The empirical part of the study is based on a survey of 20 SME entrepreneurs. \nResearch findings. It was found that SME owners believe outsourcing marketing functions (as non-core activities) effectively contributes to cost optimization, provides access to expert knowledge, and improves the achievement of strategic goals. \nTheoretical value of the research. The study confirmed the feasibility of using digital marketing outsourcing as an effective driver of development within modern management theory. \nPractical value of the research. Enterprise top managers can use the results of the scenario analysis of outsourcing decision-making to transfer specific functions to external management, achieving scalability, increased efficiency, and competitive advantages in the long term. \nOriginality/Value of the research. The research results include substantiated recommendations on the effectiveness of digital marketing outsourcing in the context of technological progress and a dynamic market environment. \nResearch limitations/Future research. The main conclusions of the study are focused on companies already utilizing marketing function outsourcing. This limits the generalization of the results to companies only planning to adopt such a strategy. Future research could focus on analyzing the integration of artificial intelligence technologies, process automation, and the use of Big Data to enhance the efficiency of outsourcing. Additionally, examining the impact of outsourcing in various economic sectors, such as manufacturing, services, or e-commerce, offers promising opportunities for developing industry-specific recommendations. \nJEL Classification: M31, M15, L24, O33", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2024-11-29", "synthetic_support_claim": "Digital marketing outsourcing effectively contributes to cost optimization and strategic goal achievement for SMEs.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Outsourcing digital marketing universally increases profitability for all small and medium-sized enterprises regardless of industry."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "3f46d797e500d1e342227545e22fb610195feccf", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3f46d797e500d1e342227545e22fb610195feccf", "title": "From Efficiency to Growth Strategy Along the Global Value Chains", "abstract": "Offshore outsourcing has been considered a low cost production site.

Data from 280 healthcare professionals across various departments in Chinese hospitals were collected, and the hierarchical regression and regression were analyzed to assess the relationship between the use of AI, psychological needs satisfaction (autonomy, competence, and relatedness), and their work well-being. The results reveal that the use of AI enhances work well-being indirectly by increasing the satisfaction of these psychological needs. Additionally, job complexity serves as a boundary condition that moderates the relationship between the use of AI and work well-being. Specifically, job complexity weakens the relationship between the use of AI and the satisfaction of autonomy and competence, while having no significant effect on the relationship between the use of AI and the satisfaction of relatedness. These findings suggest that the impact of the use of AI on healthcare professionals\u2019 well-being is contingent on job complexity.

Methodology/results: We use game theory to study the quality contracting equilibrium between one buyer and two suppliers and identify two fundamental functionalities of a traceability-driven blockchain. In serial supply chains, the ability to trace the sequential production process creates value by mitigating double moral hazard. In this case, traceability always improves product quality and all firms\u2019 profits and naturally creates a win-win. In parallel supply chains, the ability to trace the product origin enables flexible product recall, which can reduce product quality. In this case, traceability can benefit the buyer while hurting the suppliers, creating an incentive conflict. Managerial implications: Firms operating in different kinds of supply chains could face unique challenges when they adopt and design a traceability-driven blockchain. First, in serial supply chains, any firm can be the initiator of the blockchain, whereas in parallel supply chains, it may be critical for the buyer to take the lead in initiating the blockchain and properly compensate the suppliers. Second, in serial supply chains, a restricted data permission policy where each supplier shares their own traceability data with the buyer but not with each other can improve the supply chain profit, whereas in parallel supply chains, it is never optimal to restrict a firm\u2019s access to the traceability data. Third, the suppliers\u2019 incentive to enhance the governance of data quality is more aligned with the supply chain optimum in serial supply chains compared with parallel supply chains. Funding: M.

The retailer can adopt blockchain technology to have more transparent information on the freshness of supply. We quantify the value of blockchain-enabled freshness transparency by deriving closed-form expressions for the retailer\u2019s expected profit growth and food waste reduction brought by blockchain adoption. Using publicly available data, we provide a numerical example illustrating that for Walmart\u2019s strawberry business in the United States (which is about only 4% of Walmart\u2019s fresh produce sales), blockchain can increase annual profit by [Formula: see text] million while eliminating 23 million pounds of food waste annually through operational improvements. Despite this substantial value for the retailer, blockchain adoption can decrease the expected profit of the retailer\u2019s supplier. We design a family of threshold-type smart contracts contingent on a blockchain-based freshness consensus and examine when such contracts offer a win-win proposition to the retailer and the supplier. Moreover, when the retailer offers freshness-based price discounts, we find that less fresh supply leads to less food waste. In contrast, when the supplier adjusts the wholesale price based on freshness, less fresh supply causes more food waste. We also generalize our findings to the cases of (i) dual sourcing, (ii) noisy measurements in the Internet of Things sensors feeding data into blockchain, and (iii) the retailer\u2019s culling processes.

The paper delves into the significance of sustainable materials in the context of current global environmental concerns. It outlines the benefits of their integration in supply chains. Through a comprehensive literature review, the paper identifies the environmental, social, and economic advantages of incorporating sustainable materials, including reduced carbon footprints, resource conservation, waste reduction, enhanced brand reputation, and long-term resilience. However, the paper acknowledges that integrating sustainable materials is not without challenges. It highlights barriers such as higher costs, limited availability, resistance to change, and regulatory complexities that organizations must navigate. The paper presents an array of strategic approaches that organizations can adopt to overcome these challenges and effectively integrate sustainable materials. Strategies discussed include green procurement, life cycle assessment, circular economy principles, collaboration with suppliers, eco-design, certification, pilot programs, and education. Furthermore, the paper addresses the critical role of tools and technologies in assessing the environmental impact of supply chains. It explores carbon footprint calculators, environmental management systems, life cycle assessment methodologies, traceability technologies, and other digital solutions that enable data-driven decision-making, risk mitigation, and process optimization. The importance of these tools in promoting transparency, accountability, and innovation is emphasized. The findings underscore the necessity of integrating sustainable materials for positive environmental impact and highlight the broader implications for responsible resource management.

As fluctuations in trade policies\u2014such as tariffs, quotas, and subsidies\u2014directly impact food prices and market stability, this model provides a structured framework for assessing these variables\u2019 interdependencies. By integrating data on trade flows, currency exchange rates, and commodity prices, the model quantifies the effects of protective and liberalized trade measures on both local and international food markets. This approach allows for identifying trends in pricing volatility linked to policy shifts, thereby offering insights into areas vulnerable to trade disruptions and external economic shocks. The resilience of the food supply chain is measured by evaluating metrics such as delivery times, supplier diversity, and inventory levels across regions affected by trade policy changes. The findings emphasize that trade barriers can result in price spikes, delays, and supply shortages, while open trade policies generally support market flexibility and pricing stability. Additionally, the model incorporates economic indicators such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP), inflation, and unemployment rates, which correlate with food demand and purchasing power, thereby further influencing price and supply chain stability. Future research could leverage this model to develop adaptive strategies that strengthen supply chain resilience under various global trade conditions. Suggested adaptations include diversifying suppliers, increasing inventory buffers, and enhancing predictive analytics for better demand forecasting. By integrating these adaptive measures, stakeholders can mitigate adverse effects on food accessibility and affordability in both developed and emerging economies.

Results A total of 276 POS were mapped in the entire Dhaka city. About 55 POS were found within 100m distance from academic institutions in Dhaka city, which offers the easy accessibility of young generations to e-cigarettes. The younger generation is becoming the major target for e-cigarettes because of their alluring flavors, appealing looks, and variation in flavors.

This study sought to identify differences in the use of ENDS device type based on age and cigarette use status to inform policy about regulating ENDS. Design This was a cross-sectional study. Setting Data was derived from a national survey conducted in 2021 in the USA. Participants Participants include 2369 US youth and adults (13 years or older) who reported past 30-day ENDS use. Outcome measures Past 30-day fairly regular use (i.e., several times a week or more) of ENDS device types, namely cigalikes, disposables, refillable tank/box mods, closed pods, refillable pods and drippers. Cigarette smoking status was also measured. Results We used weighted regression models to determine the association between ENDS device type current regular use and age group and the association between each ENDS type current regular use and smoking status separately for each age group. Youth ENDS users 13\u201317 years old were more likely to regularly use cigalikes (OR=2.71), disposables (OR=3.44), closed pods (OR=2.57) and drippers (OR=2.86) and 18\u201329 years old were more likely to regularly use disposables (OR=3.67), closed pods (OR=1.58) and drippers (OR=1.94), compared with 30+ years\u2009old ENDS users (all p<0.05). Among 13\u201317\u2009years old, current (vs never) smokers had greater odds of current regular use for cigalikes (OR=2.79), disposables (OR=2.33), refillable tanks (OR=2.27), closed pods (OR=2.62) and drippers (OR=6.32; all p<0.05).

To address these challenges, we introduce a Decision Transformer (DT) initialized with pre-trained GPT-2 weights and fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). This architecture leverages the generalization capabilities of pre-trained language models and the efficiency of LoRA to learn effective trading policies from expert trajectories solely from historical data.

Impulsive buying consists of two key aspects: a cognitive aspect, characterized by a lack of planning and reflection, and an affective aspect, involving emotional responses that can occur before, during, or after a purchase. This study aims to explore the relationship between personality traits, as measured by the HEXACO model, and tendencies toward impulsive buying. Specifically, it examines how the HEXACO traits differentially predict the cognitive and affective components of impulsive buying tendencies. Data were collected from a sample of 420 students, with 32 excluded due to incomplete responses, resulting in a final sample of 388 students (155 men, 233 women) with an average age of 22.8. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that HEXACO personality domains significantly predicted overall impulsive buying tendencies. As expected, Honesty\u2013Humility and Conscientiousness were negatively associated with impulsive buying, while Emotionality and Extraversion positively predicted impulsive buying tendencies. Moreover, Honesty\u2013Humility, Conscientiousness, and Extraversion significantly predicted the cognitive component of impulsive buying, while Honesty\u2013Humility and Emotionality were significant predictors of the affective component.

Corporate innovation is categorised into innovation input (i.e., R&D expenditure) and innovation output (i.e., patent applications). The study finds that REM practices inversely affect corporate ESG performance and its various pillars. Likewise, firms that engage in higher REM practices are less likely to allocate resources to innovation (i.e., lower R&D expenditure) and have a low innovation output (i.e., fewer patent applications). Nevertheless, firms with higher innovation input and/or higher innovation output exhibit higher ESG performance.

Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), which involves identifying sentiment related to specific aspects within text, poses a more complex challenge compared to simple sentiment classification. To address this complexity, integrating multiple expert models has emerged as a promising approach. In this study, we propose the Evolutionary Expert Model merging with Task-adaptive Iterative Self-improvement Process (EEM-TISP) to improve ABSA task performance. EEM leverages evolutionary algorithms to merge expert models, optimizing task-specific outputs, while TISP iteratively refines these outputs, enhancing accuracy. Our results demonstrate that EEM significantly improves performance in simpler tasks, such as Aspect Term Sentiment Analysis (ATSA) and Aspect Category Sentiment Analysis (ACSA), surpassing individual expert models.

This study uniquely explored how young adults\u2014specifically GenZ and Millennials (aged 18\u201330)\u2014perceived and accepted insect-based products and whether their dietary habits aligned with sustainable principles. A mixed-methods approach was applied, including a cross-sectional study related to attributes of participants on insect products and sensory evaluation of insect and commercial products, to investigate awareness, acceptance, and sensory experiences. Key barriers included food neophobia and cultural resistance. The findings revealed a significant gap between awareness and behaviour: while 86% recognised insects as nutritious and 58% associated them with sustainability, only 18.6% have tried consuming them. This is a notable larger disparity compared to the adoption of other sustainable alternatives, such as vegetable meat based on peas, which have seen broader acceptance in recent years. Additionally, although 93.2% found products more appealing when their natural appearance is hidden, traditional insect-free products were still rated higher in taste, sweetness, and texture. Some insect-based products such as protein bars showed potential for greater acceptance than others. Bridging the awareness-behaviour gap requires targeted education, sensory improvement, and strategic marketing to emphasise nutritional and environmental benefits. Chefs could play a vital role by designing innovative menus that incorporate these products in familiar forms. This is demonstrated by successful examples where chefs have normalised unconventional ingredients, such as seaweed, overcoming cultural barriers and enhancing acceptance.

Two research questions are addressed. (1) How can literature addressing various forms of capital in the context of preparing university graduates for the labour market be integrated to offer a new ECGM? (2) How can various actors, i.e. (a) students and graduates, (b) educators, (c) careers and employability professionals, and (d) graduate employers, operationalise the ECGM? The systematic literature review resulted in a final corpus of 94 manuscripts for qualitative content analysis. Findings led to the construction of a new ECGM comprising nine forms of employability capital (social capital, cultural capital, psychological capital, personal identity capital, health capital, scholastic capital, market-value capital, career identity capital, and economic capital), external factors, and personal outcomes. Twenty-three opportunities for the operationalisation of the ECGM were also identified. The theoretical and conceptual contribution comes from constructing a new ECGM to bridge the fields of graduate employability and career development in the context of preparing individuals for the transition from university into the labour market. The practical contribution comes from operationalising the ECGM at the education-employment nexus.

Currently, entrepreneurs are struggling not only with the uncertainty of the business environment, but also with high expectations for businesses to be run in a\u00a0sustainable way. Therefore, the impact of corporate reputation and social media on sustainability is an area of interest for entrepreneurs.

These challenges have a profound impact on agriculture, with climate change leading to unpredictable weather and more frequent extreme events that threaten crop yields and farming sustainability. Farmers are also grappling with rising input costs and market volatility, intensifying the need for improved productivity and efficiency. Purpose Considering these challenges, digital technology, particularly mobile internet (MI), is emerging as a key tool for achieving sustainable agriculture by enhancing productivity, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. While much research has focused on the effects of MI on agricultural inputs, prices, and operational efficiency, there is limited understanding of its direct impact on food production outcomes. This study aims to fill this gap by examining the influence of MI usage on crop production. Method The study utilizes data from 660 farmers across two provinces of Pakistan. Propensity Score Matching (PSM) and linear regression models are employed to assess the impact of MI usage on food production. Results The analysis reveals a significant positive effect of MI usage on crop production, with MI users experiencing a 13.30% increase in crop yield compared to non-users. The heterogeneity analysis shows varying impacts among different farmer groups: young farmers see a 13.50% increase, less-educated farmers a 15.27% rise, larger-scale farmers a 23.80% boost, and those in economically developed villages a 10.50% improvement per hectare compared to non-users. Conclusion The study highlights the potential of MI in boosting crop production, particularly for specific farmer demographics. Policymakers should prioritize the development of MI infrastructure in rural areas and collaborate with research institutions, agricultural cooperatives, and enterprises to design interventions, such as financial support and technical assistance, that can help farmers fully leverage the benefits of digital technology.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-11-07", "synthetic_support_claim": "Mobile internet usage leads to a 13.30% increase in crop yield among farmers in Pakistan.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Climate change mitigation can be significantly achieved through the widespread use of mobile internet in agriculture."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "138d7ac669465d00c8661b590605b507905c06e1", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/138d7ac669465d00c8661b590605b507905c06e1", "title": "Co\u2010digestion of olive mill wastewater and municipal solid waste landfill leachate promotes medium\u2010chain fatty acids and hydrogen production", "abstract": "The management of olive mill wastewater (OMWW) and municipal solid waste landfill leachate presents a significant challenge due to their high concentrations of organic matter and phenolic compounds.

PLS-SEM was utilized to maximize the explained variance of endogenous constructs and handle mediation effects, aligning with the study\u2019s explanatory purpose. The NCA was used to identify necessary conditions for sustained competitive advantage by examining the extent to which the conditions (i.e. entrepreneurial orientation, strategic agility and CSR) are present in all cases where sustained competitive advantage is present.FindingsThe PLS-SEM analysis found that entrepreneurial orientation positively influences sustained competitive advantage and CSR and strategic agility partially mediates the relationship between entrepreneurial orientation and sustained competitive advantage and between entrepreneurial orientation and CSR. The NCA results imply that CSR, entrepreneurial orientation and strategic agility have small but significant effect sizes, indicating they are necessary conditions for achieving higher levels of sustained competitive advantage. Additionally, firm age and size are not necessary conditions.Originality/valueThis study provides a more comprehensive understanding of entrepreneurial orientation influencing sustained competitive advantage in SMEs. It challenges previous beliefs regarding the impact of CSR on sustained competitive advantage, particularly in the Moroccan SME context.

Methods: This research adopted a stochastic approach based on Bayesian Networks to evaluate the implications of business continuity on firms\u2019 decisions to embrace SC practices, focusing on omnichannel strategies, SC coordination, and technologies such as artificial intelligence systems, big data and machine learning, and mobile applications. Results: Our findings revealed that firms facing disruption in a single performance area can apply specific strategies to maintain resilience.

The results are in a mixed pattern because many studies reveal that the financial technology and financial stability of the banking sector have positive and significant results because the contribution of financial technology boosts their operation in many ways, like lending and borrowing, wealth management, asset management, insurance, and many other activities that a commercial bank performs. On the other hand, various studies have found a negative and insignificant relationship between Fintech and financial stability. Because of that, there are some factors like risk and government laws and regulations that do not have enough management. Fintech and corporate social responsibility also have a positive impact on the financial stability of the banking sector. Because of the new potential and risks for the monetary segment, the present article contributes to our knowledge of how the expansion of fintech businesses affects the banking industry.

Drawing upon influencer marketing theory, this study examines the mechanisms through which influencers (live streamers) promote consumers\u2019 purchase intention in the context of live streaming e-commerce. A sample of 449 valid questionnaires was utilized to test the proposed theoretical framework. The empirical research findings reveal that customer experience significantly and positively impacts both influencer trust and influencer attachment. Furthermore, trust and attachment established with live streamers are identified as two effective mechanisms influencing consumer decision-making. Notably, influencer attachment exhibits a stronger influence on consumer purchase intention compared to influencer trust. By comparing the effects of Taobao and Douyin live streamers on stimulating consumption and purchase intention, the study demonstrates that live streamers play a crucial mediating role between customer experience and consumer purchase intention. Specifically, the results indicate that consumer purchase intention influenced by top Taobao streamers is stronger than that of Douyin streamers, whereas influencer attachment for Taobao streamers is relatively weaker than that for Douyin streamers. These findings provide theoretical and managerial implications for platforms and live streamers seeking to stimulate robust purchase intentions among consumers by fostering attachment relationships. The establishment of an emotional connection between the live streamer and the audience proves particularly valuable in increasing purchase intention. This research contributes to the understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving consumer behavior in the context of live streaming e-commerce. It emphasizes the significance of customer experience, influencer trust, and influencer attachment as key drivers of consumer purchase intention. The findings offer valuable insights for platforms and live streamers to optimize their strategies and enrich user data labels in order to enhance consumer engagement and stimulate purchase intentions.

With the experimental priming of thinking style (analytic vs. holistic), these context effects were investigated by measuring French participants' purchase intention and willingness to pay for poke bowls-a lower-calorie, nutrient-dense food. The results demonstrate that situational induction of thinking style has a differential impact on the relative increase in consumers' purchase preferences for options offering either a dominant value in a specific attribute or an intermediate value throughout the available attributes. The attraction (compromise) effect was amplified with analytic (holistic) thinking style, leading consumers to have a higher purchase intention and willingness to pay for the dominating (intermediate) option of poke bowls.

The study revealed that a majority of small enterprises in Bosaso have access to credit, with Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) and banks being the primary sources. However, a significant minority still lacks access to credit, mainly due to weak banking infrastructure and insufficient collateral. Small enterprises face numerous challenges when seeking loans, including insufficient guarantor, Political instability, limited financial infrastructure, high interest rates, and limited collateral. These challenges hinder their ability to access credit, limiting their growth potential. Also, the regression analysis indicated a positive and significant relationship between credit availability and small enterprise growth.

While they provide convenience and flexibility to millions of customers, service failures are inevitable and can significantly impact customer satisfaction and retention. Therefore, effective recovery strategies are essential. This study examined the impact of brand image and passion on affective commitment and brand equity, which in turn affect service recovery satisfaction and repatronage intentions in Jakarta. It focuses on the emotional and psychological mechanisms that drive service recovery satisfaction and repatronage intentions, in contrast to previous studies that primarily focused on general consumer behavior. Using a quantitative survey research design, data was collected through face-to-face interviews using a structured questionnaire administered to 103 respondents selected via convenience sampling. The Structural Equation Modeling-Partial Least Squares (SEM-PLS) technique was employed due to its capacity to effectively manage complex models with smaller samples. It is suitable for the exploratory nature of this study. The findings indicate that brand image positively affects affective commitment and brand equity. Brand passion strongly influences both affective commitment and brand equity. Affective commitment significantly impacts recovery satisfaction and repatronage intentions, while brand equity also predicts both outcomes. These results highlight the importance of strategic branding and affective commitment in the service recovery process and provide important insights for improving customer retention strategies in the competitive ride-hailing sector. Despite the findings, this study has several limitations. Its focus on Gojek customers in Indonesia, the cross-sectional design, and omission of moderating factors may limit the generalizability and depth of the findings. These suggest the need for more diverse samples, longitudinal studies, and the inclusion of additional constructs in future research.

However, the relationship between kindergarten social responsibility, brand trust, perceived value, and parental loyalty is not well understood. This study investigates the influence of kindergarten social responsibility on parental loyalty, focusing on the mediating roles of brand trust and perceived value. A nationwide survey was conducted, collecting 745 valid responses from parents across 27 provinces in China. Data were analyzed using the PROCESS macro, with mediation effects tested via the bias-corrected nonparametric percentile bootstrap method. The findings reveal that kindergarten social responsibility significantly enhances parental loyalty both directly and indirectly through brand trust and perceived value. Brand trust was identified as the strongest mediator, particularly in non-inclusive kindergartens, where its effect on loyalty was more pronounced. The study also found that parents with higher education levels and higher income tend to have lower perceptions of social responsibility and perceived value, affecting their loyalty. These results suggest that kindergartens must tailor their social responsibility strategies to different parent demographics and kindergarten types to maximize parental loyalty. The study emphasizes the importance of social responsibility in strengthening parental loyalty, with specific implications for inclusive and non-inclusive kindergartens.

Despite extensive research on individual factors, such as environmental awareness and perceived consumer effectiveness, a gap remains in the literature regarding the integration of these elements into a comprehensive framework. By synthesizing existing academic studies, this review identifies key determinants shaping green purchasing decisions: psychological factors, such as environmental concern; social influences, including peer pressure and social norms; economic considerations, such as willingness to pay for eco-friendly products; and contextual factors, including green marketing strategies and product availability. These findings underscore the need for an integrated approach that considers how these factors interact, offering insights into how consumers are motivated to engage in sustainable consumption.

The analysis of the mechanism shows that the implementation of green credit policies has a negative impact on digital innovation by increasing the financing constraints faced by firms, and has also a crowding-out effect on R&D investment, resulting in a disincentive to digital innovation.

Moreover, the study reveals that Party organization embedding facilitates green governance through mechanisms such as reducing agency costs and optimizing management decisions. Agency costs have a negative transmission effect, while management decisions have a positive transmission effect, with the quality of internal control playing a crucial moderating role.Research limitations/implicationsMost existing studies on firm green governance have focused on aspects such as the heterogeneity of management teams (Liu, 2019; Wu et\u00a0al., 2019), executive green cognition (Fineman and Clarke, 1996; Huang and Wei, 2023), organizational structure and the involvement of controlling families (Bertrand and Schoar, 2006; Symeou et\u00a0al., 2019), with limited attention to the unique role of Party organizations\u2019 incentive and restraint mechanisms, supervisory power and management functions in firm green governance. Additionally, while scholars have examined the impact of political embedding in firms, including Party organization embedding as a specific form of political embedding, and find that it affects various aspects of business performance (Chang and Wong, 2004; Gu and Yang, 2023), governance quality (Li et\u00a0al., 2020; Huang and Yang, 2024), agency costs (Qian, 2000; Wang and Ma, 2014), excessive management compensation (Chang and Wong, 2004; Chen et\u00a0al., 2014), social externalities and audit needs (Faccio, 2006; Cheng, 2022), there is still insufficient discussion on how Party organization embedding promotes firm green governance. Particularly in the context of China\u2019s unique system and using Chinese data, there is a need for more in-depth research on the impact of Party organization embedding on firm green governance. This paper addresses this research gap by empirical analysis.Practical implicationsOverall, this study has significant theoretical and practical implications. Theoretically, it enriches the literature on Party organization embedding and firm green governance, filling a gap in the intersection research of firm governance and green governance. Practically, on the one hand, this paper\u2019s findings demonstrate that the involvement of Party organizations in firm governance plays a significant role in enhancing green governance. This supports the modernization of firm governance in China, establishes a micro-level foundation for achieving the strategic goals of \u201ccarbon peaking and carbon neutrality\u201d and offers empirically-backed insights into green transformation for policymakers. The research also provides practical policy recommendations for strengthening Party building efforts within firms and optimizing government-business relations, thereby facilitating the deep integration of Party building with business operations. On the other hand, this study highlights that the unique feature of China\u2019s corporate governance system, Party organization embedding, can effectively enhance green governance. This offers empirical support for leveraging the strengths of China\u2019s firm governance model and provides valuable governance strategies for firms in other countries and regions to improve their green governance practices.Social implicationsThis study\u2019s social implications are significant as it highlights the broader societal benefits that arise from integrating Party organization involvement into firm governance structures, especially within the context of green governance. By improving the green governance practices of firms, Party organization embedding helps to address pressing environmental issues such as pollution, carbon emissions and resource depletion, which ultimately contributes to healthier living environments and a more sustainable society. The emphasis on green governance supports China\u2019s national strategy for sustainable development and demonstrates a governance model that balances economic growth with environmental stewardship. Additionally, the study underscores the role of Party organizations in fostering social responsibility, equity and cohesion by ensuring that firm decision-making aligns with both economic and social welfare goals. This model of governance provides a framework that can serve as a reference for other countries and regions looking to enhance environmental protection efforts while maintaining social stability and economic progress.Originality/valueThis study offers original insights by exploring the distinctive role of Party organization embedding in enhancing firm green governance within the unique context of China\u2019s political and economic systems. Unlike previous research, which has primarily focused on conventional governance structures, this paper delves into the underexplored area of how Party organizations influence firm-level green governance. By examining the direct and indirect effects of Party organization embedding, this study expands current understanding of corporate governance models that integrate political structures, providing a novel perspective on how firms can achieve both economic and environmental objectives. The findings not only contribute to the literature on green governance but also present a valuable model for emerging economies that are pursuing sustainable development.

In such cases, many data consumers post their queries for urban statistic analysis in the system, like the scales of traffics, and then data contributors in IoT networks upload their contents, which can be evaluated by data brokers and responded to data consumers. However, huge volumes of devices bring large scales of data, constituting heavy burdens for data exchange. Even worse, contents in IoT systems are also sensitive as they are usually linked to private physical status of data contributors. The previous studies for IoT data trading fail to provide comprehensive estimation and pricing towards these difficulties. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel framework for the range counting trading over IoT networks by jointly considering data utility, bandwidth consumption, and privacy preservation. The range counting accumulates the number of data items falling in a concerned range of value, providing important information on the underlying data distribution. This paper first proposes a novel sampling-based method with histogram sketching for range counting estimation. The estimator is proved to be unbiased and achieves advanced performance on variance. Then the framework adopts a perturbation mechanism that can further preserve the results under differential privacy. The theoretical analysis shows that the mechanism can guarantee the privacy preservation under a given size of samples and the accuracy requirement of results. Finally, two types of pricing strategies for range counting trading are introduced for different circumstances, providing holistic consideration on how the parameters given in the estimator should be used for data trading.

This facilitates the conversion of raw data into valuable products and services, resulting in significant economic and social benefits. To issue data security problems in trading mechanisms, several solutions based on local differential privacy (LDP) provide lightweight methods for privacy preservation and efficient data exchange. However, most solutions lack effective mechanisms for longitudinal data. Moreover, LDP needs to address the data quality problem in IoT. At last, the pricing of privacy-preserving longitudinal data remains unresolved. To address these problems, we propose a privacy-preserving data trading (PPDT) scheme for IoT in this article. Specifically, to guarantee the security of longitudinal data, we utilize two perturbation techniques to accommodate data owners with varying privacy preferences. To enhance data availability, we devise a binary tree-based aggregation algorithm combined with a weighted average strategy and maximum likelihood estimation.

Restrictions curb the spread of a virus but also cause serious economic challenges. Evidence on how the severity of lockdown policies impacts the economic behaviour of households in low- and middle-income countries over time remains absent. To close this knowledge gap, we study the immediate and protracted effects of COVID-19 lockdowns on households' economic coping strategies. Specifically, we examine how variations in intensity and duration of lockdown policies affect the use of savings, selling assets and reducing essential non-food expenditure in four African countries: Mozambique, Sierra Leone, Tanzania and Uganda. Using \u2018Life with Corona Africa\u2019, a large-scale dataset collected through continuous phone interviews over a full year in 2021, we apply a linear probability model with country and month fixed effects to test the combined effect of the duration and intensity of lockdown policies. We find that, immediately after the introduction of (stricter) lockdown policies, the share of households who spend savings or sell assets declines. Instead, households reduce expenditure on non-food essential items, such as education and clothing. Under longer lockdowns, however, households change their response and spend their savings and sell their assets. The effects are particularly pronounced for the two poorest quintiles of households. Taken together, our findings underscore the importance of providing adequate social safety nets for poor households to deal with income shocks under protracted lockdowns since households can only cope with short lockdowns without employing harmful adaptation mechanisms.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-12-01", "synthetic_support_claim": "Households initially reduce non-food essential expenses but later spend savings and sell assets under prolonged lockdowns.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Economic support measures directly mitigate the negative impact of lockdowns on household coping strategies in all scenarios."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "0a9ba90ea915214b32aa9533a7e1c51e4238c4c8", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0a9ba90ea915214b32aa9533a7e1c51e4238c4c8", "title": "Green is the new black: How research and development and green innovation provide businesses a competitive edge", "abstract": "As part of the burgeoning research on green innovation (GI) and its influence on competitive advantage (CA), this paper examines the moderating effect of research and development (R&D) on this nexus.

In a very short time span, consumers and a wide range of organizations have adopted generative AI technologies with astonishing capabilities (Bove 2023). These new technological developments have accelerated the integration of AI into many tools, apps, and areas of our daily life, but the transformative AI technology is perhaps most deeply impacting the world of advertising. AI-enabled advertising spending worldwide in 2022 was estimated to be $370 billion, with predictions of $1.3 trillion in the next ten years (Statista 2023). While the viral sensation and enormous popularity of ChatGPT are generating unprecedented attention and interest in AI right now, AI, as both a theoretical concept and version of its technological implementations and applications, has a long history with its origin going back to the 1950s. In the advertising field, the first research article on the topic of AI in connection to advertising was published in 1988 (Cook and Schleede 1988). The authors described \u201cdecision support systems\u201d (i.e., expert systems) as probably the \u201cmost widely implemented and well-known applications of AI\u201d (48). As described, these systems used databases and models to solve problems, such as help with direct-mail systems and newspaper advertising placement. Since then, AI has changed the business of media and advertising and attracted attention from both advertising practitioners and scholars. Although there is no standard definition, Rodgers (2021) defined AI advertising as \u201cbrand communication that uses a range of machine functions that learn to carry out tasks with intent to persuade with input by humans, machines, or both\u201d (2) and positioned AI advertising as a subdiscipline of advertising \u201csituated at the intersection of cognitive science, computer science, and advertising\u201d (2). Advertisers are using AI technologies in automated market segmentation and targeting, ad creative development and personalization, improving ad buying and placement, and optimizing advertising investment (Kietzmann, Paschen, and Treen 2018). Following the trend of increasing AI adoption in advertising, advertising scholars have organized sessions at the American Academy of Advertising (AAA) conference, such as the 2014 preconference, \u201cBig Data for Advertising Research and Education,\u201d and the joint AAA-ANA Educational Foundation luncheon panel with the provocative title, \u201cThe Future of Advertising\u2014Will We Be Replaced by Robots?\u201d in 2018. The Journal of Advertising (JA) has published multiple themed collections on AI-related topics, starting with a Special Section on Artificial Intelligence and Advertising, guest-edited by Hairong Li (2019). This collection of articles explored the potential and actual application of AI technologies to enhance advertising efficiency, effects, and effectiveness across the entire spectrum of the advertising campaign process, from situation analysis and consumer insight generation to advertising message creation, to media planning and buying, and to advertising effect assessment (see the Journal of Advertising, vol. 48, no. 4). Another Special Section on Advances in Computational Advertising in 2020, guest edited by Jisu Huh and Ed Malthouse (2020), addressed broad implications of evolving computer science technologies for data-driven, AI-powered computational advertising, and proposed a future research agenda in the areas of macro and exogenous factors, consumers\u2019 roles in computational advertising, AI-powered ad content generation, computational advertising media planning strategy shifts from purchasing exposure to focusing on meaningful consumer engagement, and computational advertising measurement systems (see the Journal of Advertising, vol. 49, no. 4). A year later, JA published an up-to-date comprehensive Themed Issue on Promises and Perils of Artificial Intelligence and Advertising (2021, vol. 50, no. 1). In her editorial, the previous editor, Shelly Rodgers (2021) proposed an AI classification schema to systematically understand and develop subdomains", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-07-13", "synthetic_support_claim": "AI-enabled advertising spending worldwide is predicted to reach $1.3 trillion in the next ten years.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "AI in advertising will completely replace human marketers within the next decade."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "33937ccda505d9d6bce2106f9cf98479a71824a3", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/33937ccda505d9d6bce2106f9cf98479a71824a3", "title": "Examining Ethical Applications of AI in Advertising and Marketing Industries*", "abstract": "Artificial intelligence infused into advertising has changed the nature of campaigns to increased efficiency and targets.

These changes have made the supply network more complex, particularly with regards to sustainability issues, and have increased the vulnerability of the supply chain to sustainability\u2010related risks. However, despite the growing importance of sustainability\u2010related supply chain risks (SSCRs), there is a lack of understanding and inadequate research on critical aspects in the existing literature on this topic, such as how firms in volatile and demand\u2010driven sectors cope with SSCRs and how these risks affect the firms' operational performance. To address this gap, this study investigates the impact of sustainability\u2010related supply chain risks on suppliers, customers, and the economic performance of businesses in the garment industry in Vietnam. Using a sample of 254 garment companies, this study aims to develop a comprehensive measuring scale for supply chain sustainability risk and evaluates the effectiveness of dynamic supply chain management techniques in mitigating the impact of sustainability\u2010related risks on firm performance characteristics. The findings of this research reveal that there is a risk\u2013return trade\u2010off for economic hazards, while no such trade\u2010off is observed for social and environmental hazards. Furthermore, we find that supplier management and supply chain integration methods can assist in the management of environmental hazards, leading to a positive outcome for both businesses and the environment.

This article discusses the non-financial reporting of Russian companies, international and national standards and initiatives in the field of sustainable development.\nObjectives. The article aims to analyze the distinctive features of approaches to determining material topics in the formation of sustainability reporting, as well as identify the approach used by representatives of Russian companies in the for\u00admation of non-financial reporting at present.\nMethods. For the study, we used analysis and synthesis, comparison, and generalization.\nResults. Based on consideration of the evolution of approaches to determining materiality in the formation of sustainability reporting, the article substantiates the priority of the Double Materiality approach, which is gradually replacing the approach of determining the Materiality of Impacts, summarizes the steps to select material topics, and identifies the characteristic features of the formation of sustainability reports by Russian companies in terms of stakeholder engagement and identification of material topics.\nConclusions and Relevance. In recent years, international and national standards and initiatives in the field of sustainable development contain recommen\u00addations on the application of the Double Materiality approach, which in turn implies not only the assessment of Impact Materiality, but the assessment of Financial Materiality as well.

Traditional relative valuation methods heavily rely on tedious and expensive human efforts, especially for non-publicly listed companies. However, the availability of information about company\u2019s invisible assets, such as patents, talent, and investors, enables a new paradigm to learn and evaluate corporate relative values automatically. Indeed, in this paper, we reveal that, the companies and their core members can natually be formed as a heterogeneous graph and the attributes of different nodes include semantically-rich multi-modal data, thereby we are able to extract a latent embedding for each company. The network embeddings can reflect domain experts\u2019 behavior and are effective for corporate relative valuation.

Methods In this study, a theoretical framework model of SOR comprising six variables is established. SPSS and SmartPLS are used to test the model and analyze data collected from a comprehensive questionnaire survey of 424 Chinese online consumers. Results Results demonstrate that the impact of background fitting in e-commerce live streaming on consumers\u2019 purchase intentions can be divided into three stages. In the first stage, background fitting (comprised of both product-background fit and anchor-background fit) positively affect consumer cognitive process (perceived trust and perceived value). Perceived trust is mainly affected by anchor-background fit, while perceived value is mainly affected by product-background fit. In the second stage, consumers\u2019 cognitive process subsequently affects their affective process (perceived pleasure). Perceived value also has a greater positive effect on consumers\u2019 perceived pleasure than perceived trust, although perceived trust is a prerequisite for improving perceived value. In the third stage, the affective process further promotes consumers\u2019 purchase intentions. Conclusion Combining both SOR theory and cognitive-affective perspective, this study reveals that the internal influence mechanism of background fitting in e-commerce live streaming on consumers\u2019 purchase intentions is divided into three stages. Theoretically, this study not only expands the application of SOR theory in the research field of e-commerce live streaming from the perspective of external background stimulation, but also importantly contributes to the application of cognitive-emotional perspective in e-commerce live streaming.

It becomes even more problematic in healthcare, where data confidentiality is essential. In literature, centralized storage utilizing cloud\u2010based solutions is employed to manage large volumes of data, restricting information sharing beyond the institution.

These encryption techniques deliver safe data transmission via RSA and efficient data storage via AES, offering a secure mechanism to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches. In addition, private data collection is incorporated to securely store confidential patient information, guaranteeing privacy, security, and limited access. Also, an Access Control List (ACL) is defined for different users to implement access permissions, i.e., grant and revoke access to viewers while sharing information.

The performance evaluation is performed by conducting experimental simulations, where critical performance indicators such as throughput and latency are measured across different transaction rates, channels, and rate controllers.

At the center of the collapse was a run on a blockchain-based borrowing and lending protocol (Anchor) that promised high yields to its stablecoin (UST) depositors. Using detailed data from the Terra blockchain and trading data from exchanges, we show that the run on Terra was a complex phenomenon that happened across multiple chains and assets. It was unlikely due to concentrated market manipulation by a third party but instead was precipitated by growing concerns about the sustainability of the system. Once a few large holders of UST adjusted their positions on May 7th, 2022, other large traders followed. Blockchain technology allowed investors to monitor each other\u2019s actions and amplified the speed of the run. Wealthier and more sophisticated investors were the first to run and experienced much smaller losses. Poorer and less sophisticated investors ran later and had larger losses. The complexity of the system made it difficult even for insiders to understand the buildup of risk. Finally, we draw broader lessons about financial fragility in an environment where a regulatory safety net does not exist, pseudonymous transactions are publicly observable, and market participants are incentivized to monitor the financial health of the system. \u2217Jiageng Liu: E62-685, 100 Main Street, Cambridge MA 02138, USA.

Recent literature and regulators have taken notice of this predicament. The deployment of green innovation, responsible leadership induction, and green human resource management (GHRM) techniques have been made necessary by the significant focus on attaining business sustainability. This study aims to provide light on the banking industry\u2019s perception of how GHRM practices, green innovation, and responsible leadership affect business sustainability practices. The data were provided by 396 banking professionals employed by the top five commercial sector banks nationwide.

Employing a composite index derived through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as a measure of financial inclusion and covering four aspects (access, depth, efficiency, stability), our analysis reveals negative outcomes. The findings indicate that enhancing financial inclusion is associated with a notable increase in CO2 per capita emissions as well as in Total Greenhouse Gas emissions. We demonstrate that controlling corruption improves environmental quality, yet this measure alone is insufficient to fully mitigate the impact of financial inclusion, as indicated by our moderation analysis. The same analysis, however, shows that fostering globalization through trade openness is an efficient tool to alleviate the positive effect of financial inclusion on the quality of the environment. The study employs various policies targeting the control of development levels, energy consumption, natural resource utilization, industry, and urban population dynamics to contextualize the influence of financial inclusion on environmental sustainability. Through econometric methods and a comprehensive examination of the specified time frame, our results provide insights into the complex interplay between financial inclusion and environmental outcomes in diverse socio-economic contexts.

To quantify the indirect outcome of the existence of FDI on CO2 emissions, in this study, the three mediating channels of FDI are considered. The three broad mediating channels of FDI inflows are energy structure, industrial structure, and high-carbon technology, by which foreign direct investments affect India\u2019s carbon dioxide emissions. In this study, the unit root test, the Johansen cointegration, the Granger causality technique, and the seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) are used for the empirical analysis. The findings discover a process of cointegration in the long-run and reveal unidirectional causation between FDI inflows and CO2 emissions. The outcomes of the SUR estimation indicate that all the mediating factors substantially contribute to the level of CO2 emissions. In this paper, the findings reveal that FDI inflows affect the level of India\u2019s CO2 emissions mainly via mediating factors compared to their direct effect.

Hence, this study aims to examine the relationship between value components (i.e., biospheric, altruistic, collectivistic), beliefs (i.e., explicit and implicit attitude), norms (i.e., social and personal norm), and green purchase intention to visit green hotels. Methods An online survey of convenience sampling technique was adopted for data collection. A total of 373 valid questionnaires were subjected to descriptive analysis, and confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling were performed for the testing of the hypotheses.

Aims and Methods This study assessed trends in sales and prices of e-cigarettes by nicotine strength level, including by product type and flavor, during January 2017\u2013March 2022. US e-cigarette retail sales data were licensed from IRI company. Nicotine strength was categorized as: <1%; 1% to <2%; 2% to <3%; 3% to <4%; 4% to <5%; \u22655%. E-cigarette flavors were categorized as tobacco, menthol, mint, or other flavors. Product type was categorized as prefilled cartridge devices, disposable devices, or e-liquid bottles. Trend analyses were performed using Joinpoint Regression. Results During January 2017\u2013March 2022, the unit share of products containing \u22655% nicotine strength increased by 1486.3%, while the dollar share increased by 1345.5%. By March 2022, 80.9% of total unit sales were composed of products containing \u22655% nicotine strength. By flavor, the percentage of units sold with \u22655% nicotine strength was 61.3% of tobacco-flavor sales, 79.3% of menthol sales, 87.4% of mint sales, and 96.1% of other flavor sales. By product type, the percentage of units sold with \u22655% nicotine strength was 90.6% of disposable e-cigarette sales and 74.2% of prefilled cartridge sales. During January 2017\u2013March 2022, the price of low-nicotine strength e-cigarettes increased, while the price of high-nicotine products either decreased or did not change. Conclusions Sales of high nicotine-strength e-cigarettes have dominated the US e-cigarette market. Limiting the nicotine strength of e-cigarettes could be considered as part of a comprehensive tobacco control strategy to reduce youth access to and use of these products. Implications The findings from this study indicate that previously reported increases in e-cigarette nicotine strength during 2013\u20132018 have continued through 2022.

Two independent reviewers coded for type of ONP, brand, nicotine strength(s), flavour(s), slogan(s), claim(s) and frequency of each component.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMost ads featured nicotine pouches alone (52%), while 22% featured a mix of ONPs including pouches, tablets and lozenges. By brand, Rogue constituted 36% of ads, followed by Zyn and On! (16% each). Most (82%) ads featured at least one cooling flavour and 48% displayed at least one fruit flavour. Wintergreen flavour appeared most frequently (48%). Most (72%) ads contained a slogan, which frequently highlighted convenience of use (eg, 'Chew on this Anywhere\u2026 Anytime'), bypassing current restrictions on other tobacco and nicotine products use (eg, 'Laughs at no smoking signs') and highlighting big profit margins from sales of ONPs for retailers (eg, 'small pouches big margins').\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis analysis provides insight into tobacco companies' strategies for increasing ONP endorsement among retailers.

Studies in the field of environmental management and, particularly, in the areas of green practices, zero waste, and green innovation have suggested that, if executed properly, these organizations are able to promote EP. Under these conditions, organizations\u2019 practices and mechanisms that ensure the enhancement of the EP of these business organizations have gained the wider attention of researchers and management. Focused on the environment and social responsibility, this study explores the complex relationships within sustainable green supply chain management (GSCM) and explores whether GSCM practices significantly impact both zero waste management and green innovation. The analysis also studies whether there are possible beneficial links between zero waste management, green innovation and environmental performance (EP). Additionally, through assessing the level to which these items come together in sustainable strategic actions, the paper shows the correlation among four important topics: GSCM practices, green innovation (GI), zero waste management, and EP. This study explores the relations between zero waste management and EP as well as green innovation and EP, examining whether these aspects of green practices have a positive relationship with effective waste management techniques in the presence of GSCM practices. The paper analyses interactions between GSCM practices and EP, and the mediation role of zero waste management and GI. Moreover, the moderating role of green knowledge sharing (GKS) also been tested. A total of 389 managers in the manufacturing sector completed the survey and the results were analyzed applying SPSS 25.0 and partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The findings confirmed a significant association among GSCM practices, GI, zero waste management, GKS, and EP.

Engaging with the corporate governance concepts of ownership and control, and exit and voice, it charts the rise to prominence of the Big Three, including their environmental, social and governance (ESG) funds, in the ownership of the Carbon Majors. Having established their status as key sources of permanent capital that are unlikely to exit from their investment positions in the world\u2019s most polluting publicly listed corporations, the article examines how control may be exercised through voice by analysing the Big Three\u2019s proxy voting record at Carbon Major annual general meetings.

Remarkably, there is little to distinguish the proxy voting of the Big Three\u2019s ESG funds from their non-ESG funds. Regardless of whether these resolutions succeeded or failed, they also tend to be narrow in scope and piecemeal in nature.

With a particular focus on the green consumption behavior with regard to battery electric vehicles (BEVs) from two leading brands, Tesla (automotive) and Gogoro (scooter), in Taiwan, this study investigated the relationships among green perceived quality (GPQ), green perceived value (GPV), green brand image (GBI), green trust (GTR), and green purchase intention (GPI). After collecting 203 environmentally conscious respondents who are familiar with Tesla and Gogoro BEVs, the PLS-SEM was used to verify the research framework. The findings demonstrate that GPQ significantly impacts GBI and GPV; GBI significantly impacts GPV and GTR; and GPV significantly impacts GTR. As the key determinants of purchasing BEVs, GPQ, GBI, and GTR have significant effects on GPI, whereas the effect of GPV on GPI is not significant. In addition, this study also explored the moderation effect on green purchase behavior, revealing that the brand-specific cognition of Tesla and Gogoro moderates the relationships between green attributes (such as GPQ, GBI, and GTR) and GPI. This study contributes a more comprehensive understanding of the psychological and behavioral drivers behind green consumption behavior within the context of BEVs. This study not only sheds light on consumer behavior within dual-market dynamics in Taiwan but also offers a framework for other markets with similar environmental and infrastructural challenges.

Although prior studies have investigated factors influencing the adoption of smart retail technology, to the authors\u2019 knowledge, no previous work has investigated the determinants of purchase intentions. The ultimate goal for retailers should be shopping, not technology adoption. However, traditional brick-and-mortar stores and theories focus on investing in utilitarian factors to attract customers. This study proposes that hedonic motivation should also play an important role, as new technologies may arouse customer curiosity and increase pleasant experiences. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore utilitarian and hedonic motivations that promote customers' purchase; intentions in smart stores. Specifically, the authors address the research questions: (1) What are the constituents of utilitarian motivation? (2) What are the constituents of hedonic motivation? (3) What are the factors that influence customers' purchase intentions? By answering the questions, the findings help retailers understand how to motivate customers to make purchases in smart stores.Design/methodology/approachTo investigate consumer motivation and purchase intentions, the customers who made purchases in smart stores were invited to participate in the questionnaire survey. This study collected 307 data in smart retail settings. Partial least squares (PLS) software was used to assess the reliability, validity and the paths and significance of all hypotheses.FindingsThe results show that perceived ease of use directly and indirectly influences purchase intentions through utilitarian and hedonic motivations. Utilitarian motivation is a formative second-order construct comprised of merchandise price, merchandise quality, location convenience, speed of shopping and product recommendation. Hedonic motivation is a reflective second-order construct composed of control, curiosity, joy, focused immersion and temporal dissociation. The findings provide insights into the successful implementation of smart retail technology and offer retailers to better understand consumer motivation and purchase intentions in smart stores.Originality/valueThis study is the first to examine how consumer motivation influences purchase intentions in smart stores.

Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), pruning, and quantization are all effective methods for improving resource efficiency. However, combining them directly often results in suboptimal performance, especially with uniform quantization across all model layers. This is due to the complex, uneven interlayer relationships introduced by pruning, necessitating more refined quantization strategies. To address this, we propose AutoMixQ, an end-to-end optimization framework that selects optimal quantization configurations for each LLM layer. AutoMixQ leverages lightweight performance models to guide the selection process, significantly reducing time and computational resources compared to exhaustive search methods. By incorporating Pareto optimality, AutoMixQ balances memory usage and performance, approaching the upper bounds of model capability under strict resource constraints. Our experiments on widely used benchmarks show that AutoMixQ reduces memory consumption while achieving superior performance.

Unfortunately, such fine-tuning requires substantial memory, which limits its applicability. To address these challenges, we introduce quantization into the structured pruning framework to reduce memory consumption during both fine-tuning and inference. However, the combined errors from pruning and quantization increase the difficulty of fine-tuning, requiring a more refined quantization scheme. To this end, we propose QPruner, a novel framework that employs structured pruning to reduce model size, followed by a layer-wise mixed-precision quantization scheme. Quantization precisions are assigned to each layer based on their importance to the target task, and Bayesian optimization is employed to refine precision allocation strategies, ensuring a balance between model accuracy and memory efficiency.

Industrial revolutions led to the mass production of goods, which increased the need for modern warehouses. Every year, the operation of warehouses becomes increasingly more complicated due to the increasing abundance of goods, thus the usual warehouse management strategies are no longer suitable. In order to cope with huge product flows, modern innovations should be used more extensively to manage these processes. Successful management will help provide quality service to rapidly changing business sectors. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a technology designed to process large amounts of data with maximum efficiency in real time. This technology can facilitate the implementation of smart identification, tracking, tracing, and management using radio frequency identification (RFID), infrared sensors, global positioning systems (GPS), laser scanners, and other detection tools. Such innovations as IoT have made a significant impact on warehousing operations. The aim of IoT is to perform administrative work, i.e., to efficiently manage warehouse data. IoT can be used to monitor and track goods, forecast demand trends, manage inventory, and perform other warehouse operations in real time. The key elements of a warehouse are sales and customer satisfaction. Implementing IoT improves financial performance, work productivity, and customer satisfaction. However, innovation requires additional investment in, for instance, implementation and maintenance. It is necessary to investigate how warehouse elements such as inventory accuracy or order processing time are affected by the internet of things in companies of different sizes.

While digital transformation is often heralded as a catalyst for innovation, its potential negative effects on green innovation remain underexplored. This study fills in this gap by analyzing 1443 listed companies on the Shanghai Stock Exchange main board between 2013 and 2022, focusing on the mechanisms by which digital transformation impacts green innovation and on the moderated role of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance. Our findings reveal that digital transformation hinders green innovation by increasing financing constraints. However, good ESG performance mitigates these negative impacts by alleviating financing constraints, thereby fostering green innovation. Our findings hold up against endogeneity tests by applying instrumental variable methods. Notably, the effect of digital transformation and ESG differs significantly between state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and non-state-owned enterprises (non-SOEs).

Low-cost sensor networks are emerging as a vital solution, enabling widespread and affordable deployment at fine spatial resolutions. In this context, machine learning for the calibration of low-cost sensors is particularly valuable. However, traditional machine learning models often lack interpretability and generalizability when applied to complex, dynamic environmental data. To address this, we propose a causal feature selection approach based on convergent cross mapping within the machine learning pipeline to build more robustly calibrated sensor networks. This approach is applied in the calibration of a low-cost optical particle counter OPC-N3, effectively reproducing the measurements of PM1 and PM2.5 as recorded by research-grade spectrometers. We evaluated the predictive performance and generalizability of these causally optimized models, observing improvements in both while reducing the number of input features, thus adhering to the Occam\u2019s razor principle. For the PM1 calibration model, the proposed feature selection reduced the mean squared error on the test set by 43.2% compared to the model with all input features, while the SHAP value-based selection only achieved a reduction of 29.6%. Similarly, for the PM2.5 model, the proposed feature selection led to a 33.2% reduction in the mean squared error, outperforming the 30.2% reduction achieved by the SHAP value-based selection. By integrating sensors with advanced machine learning techniques, this approach advances urban air quality monitoring, fostering a deeper scientific understanding of microenvironments.

Our analysis suggests that the Commission increasingly operates four major developmental functions akin to DNSs and aimed at promoting and protecting the single market. Neofunctionalist theories of EU integration explain these momentous shifts. The timing behind the rise of EU industrial policy is best explained as an interplay of functional, cultivated, and political spillovers, driven especially by the Franco-German realignment on pro-EU industrial policy positions since 2016.

In light of this, we aim to democratize Internet-scale financial data for LLMs, which is an open challenge due to diverse data sources, low signal-to-noise ratio, and high time-validity. To address the challenges, we introduce an open-sourced and data-centric framework, Financial Generative Pre-trained Transformer (FinGPT), that automates the collection and curation of real-time financial data from 34 diverse sources on the Internet, providing researchers and practitioners with accessible and transparent resources to develop their FinLLMs. Additionally, we propose a simple yet effective strategy for fine-tuning FinLLM using the inherent feedback from the market, dubbed Reinforcement Learning with Stock Prices (RLSP). We also adopt the Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA, QLoRA) method that enables users to customize their own FinLLMs from general-purpose LLMs at a low cost.

To address this, we conduct a set of retrieval experiments designed to evaluate the capabilities of 17 leading LLMs, such as their ability to follow threads of information through the context window. Strikingly, we find that many models are remarkably threadsafe: capable of simultaneously following multiple threads without significant loss in performance. Still, for many models, we find the effective context limit is significantly shorter than the supported context length, with accuracy decreasing as the context window grows.

This limitation is mainly due to the proprietary nature of job platforms, which restrict the sharing of job-domain datasets with the research community. The scarcity is particularly pronounced for career trajectory and resume datasets, severely constraining academic researchers in developing and evaluating new models. In this paper, we address the crucial issue of resume dataset unavailability in the job domain, identified through our comprehensive comparison of existing job-domain machine learning studies. To the best of our knowledge, we introduce OpenResume, the first publicly available, anonymized, and structured resume dataset, specifically designed for job-domain downstream tasks. This dataset aims to catalyze advancements in AI and foster new markets for machine learning and data science within career trajectory modeling. OpenResume is comprehensively processed from real-world resume data. We anonymize and substitute personal identifiers and company names, normalize job titles into ESCO-based ones (i.e., one of the most common occupation taxonomies), and employ differential privacy techniques on temporal features to ensure open accessibility and privacy protection. Additionally, we augment OpenResume with a synthetically generated resume dataset derived from the post-processed real-world data, extending its diversity and utility. To demonstrate that OpenResume retains challenges and properties similar to real-world job datasets, we benchmark OpenResume on state-of-the-art job-domain prediction models across four prevalent downstream tasks: (1) next job title prediction, (2) next company prediction, (3) turnover prediction, and (4) link prediction.

Accordingly, the impact on customer satisfaction with chatbot usage, which is based on chatbots\u2019 communication quality and customers\u2019 motivations to use chatbots, on online purchase intention and intention to reuse chatbots was examined. Through an online questionnaire with two hundred and ten participants, employing structural equation modeling, we revealed that customer satisfaction with chatbot usage has a greater impact on the intention to reuse chatbots than on online purchase intentions. In addition, chatbot communication quality has a greater impact on customer satisfaction with chatbot usage than customers\u2019 motivation to use chatbots.

Among them, decomposition-based methods have achieved promising results. Most decomposition-based methods approximate a single function, which is insufficient for obtaining accurate results. Moreover, most existing researches have concentrated on one-step-ahead forecasting that prevents stock market investors from arriving at the best decisions for the future. This study proposes two novel methods for multi-step-ahead stock price prediction based on the issues outlined. DCT-MFRFNN, a method based on discrete cosine transform (DCT) and multi-functional recurrent fuzzy neural network (MFRFNN), uses DCT to reduce fluctuations in the time series and simplify its structure and MFRFNN to predict the stock price. VMD-MFRFNN, an approach based on variational mode decomposition (VMD) and MFRFNN, brings together their advantages. VMD-MFRFNN consists of two phases. The input signal is decomposed to several IMFs using VMD in the decomposition phase. In the prediction and reconstruction phase, each of the IMFs is given to a separate MFRFNN for prediction, and predicted signals are summed to reconstruct the output. Three financial time series, including Hang Seng Index (HSI), Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE), and Standard&Poor's 500 Index (SPX), are used for the evaluation of the proposed methods.

However, these energies face challenges such as cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed, and temperature, which introduce variability and intermittency in power generation, making integration into the interconnected grid difficult. To achieve this, we present a novel hybrid deep learning model, CEEMDAN-CNN-ATT-LSTM, for short- and medium-term solar irradiance prediction. The model utilizes complete empirical ensemble modal decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) to extract intrinsic seasonal patterns in solar irradiance. In addition, it employs a hybrid encoder-decoder framework that combines convolutional neural networks (CNN) to capture spatial relationships between variables, an attention mechanism (ATT) to identify long-term patterns, and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to capture short-term dependencies in time series data. This model has been validated using meteorological data in a more than 2400 masl region characterized by complex climatic conditions south of Ecuador. It was able to predict irradiance at 1, 6, and 12 h horizons, with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 99.89 W/m2 in winter and 110.13 W/m2 in summer, outperforming the reference methods of this study.

This study explores the intricate relationship between corporate governance attributes and Business Ethical Practices (BEP), examining how CSR engagement moderates this relationship across 386 manufacturing firms in the BRICS countries from 2010 to 2022. Grounded in Stakeholder and Agency Theories, the research investigates three core governance strands: diversity, structural, and process attributes. Using the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimator, the findings reveal that gender diversity and age diversity positively influence BEP, while national diversity has a negative association, raising concerns about the alignment of foreign board members with local ethical standards. Board independence and board size significantly enhance ethical practices, while CEO duality negatively affects BEP, emphasizing the importance of independent oversight. Among process attributes, board meetings and board tenure positively contribute to BEP, while meeting attendance shows a negative association, suggesting that mere presence without meaningful participation may not guarantee ethical outcomes. Notably, CSR engagement amplifies positive governance effects and mitigates negative influences, reinforcing its critical role as a governance enhancer.

This is especially true when the brand manufacturer authorises only a third-party reseller to sell through the platform, a practice that may provide opportunities to counterfeiters. To address this issue, we establish a theoretical model in which one brand manufacturer wholesales its products to a third-party reseller who then sells through an online platform. The platform acts as a marketplace, while multiple counterfeiters also exist on the platform, which may deceive consumers. In particular, we consider that the manufacturer can encroach with a direct channel and that the platform can adopt blockchain technology to help consumers identify authenticity. The results show that the platform could induce the brand manufacturer to encroach by deploying blockchain technology. Furthermore, an interesting result indicates that although either manufacturer encroachment or blockchain technology used alone can effectively boycott counterfeits, the coexistence of two strategies can raise the demand for counterfeit products.

Results show a significant positive influence of dynamic capabilities on green innovation, although this effect varies depending on the research and development model and the level of environmental turbulence.

Many market analysts strive to use a large amount of information for stock price prediction, and Twitter is one of the richest sources of information presenting real-time opinions of people. However, previous works that use tweet data in stock movement prediction have suffered from two limitations. First, the number of tweets is heavily biased towards only a few popular stocks, and most stocks have insufficient evidence for accurate price prediction. Second, many tweets provide noisy information irrelevant of actual price movement, and extracting reliable information from tweets is as challenging as predicting stock prices.In this paper, we propose SLOT (Self-supervised Learning of Tweets for Capturing Multi-level Price Trends), an accurate method for stock movement prediction. SLOT has two main ideas to address the limitations of previous tweet-based models. First, SLOT learns embedding vectors of stocks and tweets in the same semantic space through self-supervised learning. The embeddings allow us to use all available tweets to improve the prediction for even unpopular stocks, addressing the sparsity problem. Second, SLOT learns multi-level relationships between stocks from tweets, rather than using them as direct evidence for prediction, making it robust to the unreliability of tweets.

ZoomStock captures complex patterns in stock price data with multi-scale and multi-domain modeling. First, ZoomStock captures multi-scale patterns by examining short-term, mid-term, and long-term dependencies from data. By feeding multi-scale data into a 1D convolution layer and applying a circular convolution on data, we learn patterns in various scales. Second, ZoomStock leverages multi-domain features to extract diverse patterns from stock data. In addition to finding patterns in time domain, ZoomStock exploits patterns in the frequency domain via Fourier Transform. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets from diverse stock markets to evaluate the effectiveness of ZoomStock.

We construct a game-theoretic model that encompasses both an e-commerce platform and a manufacturer. In this model, the platform chooses its selling format\u2014either wholesale or agency\u2014while the manufacturer determines whether to launch an online direct channel. Our analysis takes into account consumer preferences for both product brands and sales channels. We compare and analyze the equilibrium outcomes across four different scenarios, leading to the following conclusions: (1) When the platform utilizes the wholesale selling format, the manufacturer is consistently motivated to launch the direct channel if the costs associated with it are low. Conversely, when the platform employs the agency selling format, the manufacturer\u2019s decision to establish an online direct marketing channel depends on the relative strength of consumers\u2019 eco-friendly and channel preferences. (2) The platform\u2019s choice of selling format is affected by the manufacturer\u2019s channel strategy, leading the platform to modify its selling format based on varying manufacturer channel approaches. (3) The choices of the platform\u2019s selling format and the manufacturer\u2019s channel strategy are not always in conflict. When consumer preferences for the manufacturer\u2019s direct channel are strong and the cost of introducing it is moderate, the platform\u2019s decision to adopt the agency selling format can create a win-win outcome for both the platform and the manufacturer.

The wine-making process is a huge generator of waste, creating problems for manufacturers every year; therefore, an appropriate management and valorisation of winery wastes are crucial, even if it is difficult. This results from the hardship of disposing of grape marc, which is considered a pollutant for the environment. In the past, the simplest option for this waste disposal was the payment of a fee around EUR 3000, which recently increased up to EUR 30,000\u201340,000. Several environmentally friendly technologies have been proposed for the recovery of cellar waste. Fermentation of grape residue, pruning, or wine-making lees have been reported to yield lactic acid, surfactants, xylitol, ethanol, and other compounds.

Ethical considerations arising from the Australian Government's use of behavioural insights and Robodebt", "abstract": "Behavioural insights and the use of nudge have attracted a lot of interest among governments across the globe since the introduction of the UK's Behavioural Insights Unit in 2010. One of the key challenges since these early days has been the concern that behavioural policy design, in particular the use of nudges, could be misused to manipulate citizens. When the Robodebt Royal Commission released its report in 2023, these concerns were renewed in Australia. It revealed that the Department of Human Services had used behavioural insights to inform the design of letters informing citizens of a debt in such a way as to minimise the impact on call centres while shifting that impact onto citizens. Did this use finally reveal what many had feared? Could government not be trusted with behavioural insights? This article will first explore the ethical concerns that have surrounded the implementation of nudges and behavioural policy. Following this, the paper will go beyond the debate over the ethics of implementing behavioural policies and argue instead that a focus on the theoretical opportunities and risks of nudge and behavioural policy fails to capture the significant risks inherent in implementation.

The paper concludes by pointing to critical steps the Australian public sector can take to ensure future accountability and transparency for policy design, for nudges but also beyond.\nNudging is neither ethically neutral nor inherently problematic. The context in which policy is designed is critical.\nRobodebt highlighted several flaws in the context in which policy is designed in Australian federal policymaking, including a public service which appeared more comfortable with debates over technical delivery concerns than the content of policy.\nRobodebt revealed that parts of the public sector had become overly focused on \u2018what works\u2019, rather than providing advice on social desirability, acceptability, human rights, and equity.\nThis experience should therefore lead to greater apprehension about the use of nudging, as there is a risk that ethical issues will go uninterrogated.\n", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-11-14", "synthetic_support_claim": "Robodebt revealed that parts of the public sector had become overly focused on \"what works.\"", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Nudging should be banned in public policy due to its high potential for misuse and manipulation."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "fa2c9371a6378a6aa48125d3d36ac18cbd3aaa0f", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fa2c9371a6378a6aa48125d3d36ac18cbd3aaa0f", "title": "What I Really, Really Want: The Role, Nature, and Value of True Preferences in the Ethics of Nudging", "abstract": "In this article, we discuss the role that \u2018true preferences\u2019 can and should play in discussions on the possibility and desirability of paternalist nudges.

Background: The unique characteristics of blockchain technology, such as decentralization, transparency, traceability, verifiability, and immutability, have been proven to address challenges in agricultural supply chains such as low transparency, inefficiency, high dependency, financing difficulties, and information asymmetry. In reality, though, the adoption of blockchain technology in agricultural development has not met expectations. Most blockchain projects in agriculture are still in the pilot phase, with few actual applications implemented. Therefore, it is necessary to thoroughly investigate the factors influencing the adoption of blockchain technology in agricultural supply chains to promote its widespread application in this field. Methods: Based on the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework and the Diffusion of Innovations Theory (DOI), this study collected primary data through a questionnaire survey and employed Confirmatory Composite Analysis (CCA) using SmartPLS 4 to test the integrated model. The study examines the impact of technological, organizational, and environmental contexts on blockchain adoption intention in agricultural supply chains. In addition, the moderating role of perceived cost on these relationships is also explored. Results: The results indicate that technological, organizational, and environmental contexts significantly influence blockchain adoption intention, but the direct impact of perceived cost on adoption intention was non-significant. Notably, perceived cost had a crucial moderating effect on the relationship between organizational context and blockchain adoption intention. Conclusion: This study aims to explore the factors influencing blockchain adoption intentions in agricultural supply chains from an organizational perspective, innovatively applies CCA analysis within the TOE-DOI framework and adopts perceived cost as the moderating variable. These findings underscore the importance of internal evaluations of cost-effectiveness and strategic cost management for practitioners, highlighting the necessity of internal advocacy to enhance technology acceptance.

More specifically, the study first endeavors to investigate the direct impact of GPQ on GS, GT, and CGBIs besides exploring the direct impact of GS and GT on CGBIs in addition to examining the potential effect of GS and GT as mediators in the nexus between GPQ and CGBIs. To achieve the study\u2019s aim and associated objectives, a self-administrated questionnaire was developed and distributed to a convenience sample of local guests staying at certified five-green star hotels. A total of 500 questionnaires were distributed, and only 304 valid forms, representing 60.8%, were used in the statistical analysis. Seven hypotheses, reflecting the direct and indirect relationships between study constructs, were examined by using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) with bootstrapping technique. The study findings revealed that GS, GT as well as CGBIs are significantly positively affected by GPQ, respectively. Furthermore, GT and GS have a significant positive effect on CGBIs.

As a quantitative study, data were collected through a field survey of 568 foreign and domestic tourists in major tourist destinations in Indonesia. The SEM-PLS with bootstrapping analysis for mediation effect was applied in the study. The result reveals that financial risk does not directly influence guest satisfaction but significantly affects hotel attribute preferences. Health risk similarly impacts hotel attribute preferences positively without directly affecting guest satisfaction. Conversely, psychosocial risk exhibits a strong negative effect on guest satisfaction and hotel attributes. The positive relationship between hotel attributes and guest satisfaction reaffirms the critical role of service quality and physical attributes in driver satisfaction. Mediation analysis indicates that hotel attributes significantly mediate the effects of risk factors on guest satisfaction. The study concludes that enhancing hotel attributes, addressing psychosocial concerns, and investing in health-related features are pivotal strategies for hotel management to boost guest satisfaction, particularly during periods of heightened financial and health risks.

These were critically examined, and the best matching documents were then carefully chosen for inclusion to reach a conclusion. Result: The result emphasizes the necessity for human resource management managers to implement cutting-edge strategies for faculty and staff empowerment so they may traverse the fast-changing environment and perform to their full potential against the odds. To engage stakeholders in amicably avoiding recalcitrance, a conceptual qualitative framework is established and recommended for the functionalism of tailored human resource management. This approach can help managers of human resources find opportunities during this crisis and help them come to significant conclusions about how to address issues and create a positive culture. Limitation: Risks of bias such as selection bias, insufficient blinding, attrition bias, and selective outcome reporting may be among the limitations.

The purpose of this study was to analyze how blockchain technology has helped to include previously underserved populations in the mainstream financial system, and to remark on the best practices and lessons learned from sustainable development. Using a systematic literature review, the study discovered the many ways in which blockchain technology can facilitate digital financial inclusion, including its application in financial transactions, its utility as a tool for increasing financial savings, its use in the provision of credit, and its application in the provision of insurance.

This paper explores the intricate intersections of these disciplines and their profound implications for ethical supply chain management. The convergence of diplomatic negotiation strategies with theological principles results in a visionary approach that addresses the moral complexities of supply chains while fostering collaborative relationships, responsible practices, and lasting positive impacts. The paper first delves into the fundamentals of diplomatic management and its relevance to ethical supply chains. It examines how negotiation techniques grounded in mutual respect, compromise, and dialogue can transcend traditional transactional models, paving the way for equitable collaborations that encompass cultural diversity and shared value creation. The integration of theological ethics further enriches this approach, embedding moral imperatives into negotiations and emphasizing values such as justice, compassion, and stewardship. Building upon this foundation, the paper explores the practical applications of diplomatic management and theological ethics in supply chain management. It delves into case studies that exemplify how these principles can guide decision-making, strengthen partnerships, and navigate ethical challenges in complex global supply networks. Moreover, the paper underscores the potential benefits of this integrated framework, such as enhanced reputation, increased consumer loyalty, and the promotion of international cooperation. The paper also envisions the future landscape shaped by ethical supply chains guided by diplomatic management and theological ethics. It underscores the significance of this approach in reshaping industries, influencing consumer behavior, and cultivating a global culture that values responsible practices. Additionally, the paper emphasizes the role of education, advocacy, and leadership in driving the adoption of this framework, as well as the challenges and strategies associated with measuring its impact and fostering a culture of ethical resilience. Illuminates the transformative potential of integrating diplomatic management and theological ethics in ethical supply chains. By merging the principles of diplomacy, theology, and ethics, organizations can forge a path toward sustainable business practices that prioritize human dignity, environmental stewardship, and societal well-being.

This study utilized the mixed method by developing a semi-structured interview and survey, while the respondents were experts from TQM and IBS consulting firms. The content-validity approach was used, depending on 14 interviews and 28 responses to a distributed questionnaire. The findings indicate that TQM adoption of IBS projects is extremely poor. According to experts, local firms are still unable to execute TQM because they are reluctant to implement the TQM system as a strategy implementation across the construction process. Furthermore, according to the content validity ratio (CVR), there was an agreement that TQM would provide substantial benefits to IBS projects, such as offering cooperative associations, excellent communication, enhanced customer gratification, cost reductions, and productivity improvements. This study provided practical evidence of the fact that if the organizations adopted these 23 drivers of TQM they could overwhelm the challenges of TQM implementation in IBS projects.

One of the most significant challenges in the cloud computing environment is task scheduling, which directly impacts the overall performance of the platform. Tasks are assigned to specific resources at designated times based on user requests, primarily aiming to maximize resource utilization and minimize makespan. Despite various methods to enhance task scheduling, it remains a challenge in cloud computing. Efficiently scheduling tasks is a crucial step in fully leveraging the potential of cloud computing. This work presents a machine learning technique aimed at improving multitask scheduling in cloud environments. We propose an ML feature-based heuristic task scheduling (MLF-H) for efficient task management.

Currently, the most frequently installed photovoltaic modules are made of single-crystalline silicon solar cells (sc-Si). However, one of the latest solutions are perovskite solar cells (PSC), which are considered the future of photovoltaics. Therefore, the main objective of this research was to assess the environmental impact of the construction materials of monocrystalline and perovskite photovoltaic power plants toward their sustainable development. The research object was the construction materials and components of two 1 MW photovoltaic power plants: one based on monocrystalline modules and the other on perovskite modules. The life cycle assessment (LCA) method was used for the analyses. The IMPACT World+, IPCC and CED models were used in it. The analyses were performed separately for five sets of elements: support structures, photovoltaic panels, inverter stations, electrical installations and transformers. Two post-consumer management scenarios were adopted: storage and recycling. The life cycle of a photovoltaic power plant based on photovoltaic modules made of perovskite cells is characterized by a smaller negative impact on the environment compared to traditional power plants with monocrystalline silicon modules. Perovskites, as a construction material of photovoltaic modules, fit better into the main assumptions of sustainable development compared to cells made of monocrystalline silicon.

In general, the waste management sector has struggled with low consumer trust, fraud, manipulation, significant manual processes, and low levels of information and control. Recent events relating to the COVID-19 pandemic have highlighted, in particular, the role of trust in effective public policy making and consumer behavioural change. Here we propose a hybrid blockchain solution called a Polkadot parachain. Polkadot is a blockchain technology that connects a network of blockchains, each called a parachain, that can be customised to the business needs of a given application. This solution provides the cost benefits, scalability, and control of a permissioned or private blockchain while providing the security, verifiability, and trust of a public blockchain.

This study aims to extend our understanding of promoting pro-environmental behavior by exploring the role of trust and perceived justice in households\u2019 waste recycling practices. Trust and social justice are context-sensitive; studying them in different contexts provides new knowledge on motivating recycling motivation. The research is based on semi-structured interviews (n = 40) on household recycling practices in Latvia. Research results demonstrate that a lack of institutional trust and perceived social injustice concerning household waste recycling practices appear in several contexts: trust in an individual\u2019s capacity to recycle, trust in their peers\u2019 capacity to recycle, trust in the efficiency of the recycling system, trust in the capacity of the waste management company to recycle, trust in waste management policy, and trust in information on recycling. Lack of trust in waste management is linked to perceived social injustice as waste management policy is criticized for not being accessible and putting too much responsibility on households, and this can serve as a critical barrier to household recycling. This study reveals which elements of the waste management system are related to a higher risk of social injustice and lack of trust in the perspective of households, thus signaling where changes in the system or providing end-users more information are needed to make the waste-sorting process more efficient.

This study explores this relationship by synthesising 199 relevant research records published during 2019\u20132024, obtained from Web of Science and Scopus, using a bibliometric and systematic literature review approach. Our descriptive analysis reveals exponential growth in publications on this relationship during the study period, focusing predominantly on quantitative research leveraging secondary data. Regression analysis emerged as the most popular analytical technique, followed by structural equation modelling. The theoretical foundations of this research are based on the resource\u2010based view and dynamic capabilities view. The Co\u2010occurrence analysis identifies China, Italy, and England as the leading contributors, with research hot spots centring around concepts such as \u2018Industry 4.0\u2019, \u2018sustainability performance\u2019, \u2018sustainable development\u2019, and \u2018sustainability reporting\u2019. Co\u2010citation analysis highlights the leading journals, authors, and documents, emphasising the scholarly foundations of this field. Further, thematic analysis uncovers the benefits of digitalisation across four dominant dimensions: sustainability performance, supply chain sustainability, sustainability assessment, and sustainability accounting and reporting.

The major fruit-producing countries (United States, China, India, and Brazil) are responsible for a large portion of this waste. Fruit waste contains different bioactive compounds like polyphenols, flavonoids, vitamins, and carotenoids, which are, in large part, underutilized regardless of their antioxidant properties. These compounds can play an important function in poultry nutrition, offering natural alternatives to synthetic antioxidants. Reintegrating fruit waste into poultry diets might have potent benefits on the nutritional quality and shelf life of eggs. Some studies reported that bioactive compounds from fruit waste improve the oxidative stability of eggs and the nutritional content, potentially extending shelf life during storage. Additionally, antioxidant compounds from fruit waste have been shown to improve yolk coloration and some egg quality parameters while reducing reactive oxygen species, which cause lipid oxidation. Their inclusion in poultry diets can lower feed costs, promote animal welfare, and reduce the environmental impact of fruit waste. This review highlights some key fruit wastes, such as citrus, apple, grape, rosehip, sea buckthorn, and banana, among others, which are natural reservoirs of bioactive compounds beneficial for poultry nutrition. This strategy aligns with FAO sustainability goals, addressing both food waste and animal nutrition challenges.

It examines how AM is conceptualized in the contexts of platform work and the gig economy, revealing unique challenges and implications. AM functions as a holistic system, primarily in online labor platforms, where it creates a gray zone in which workers exist in an ambiguous space, neither fully inside nor outside organizational boundaries. This gray zone strategically blurs the lines between employees and freelancers, allowing platforms to circumvent traditional employment regulations. As a result, AM poses a unique challenge for HRM, OP, and OB scholars, whose frameworks typically rely on clear distinctions between employment and freelancing, often overlooking the complexities of this gray zone. The article identifies key themes emerging from the literature, highlighting the impact of AM on both individuals and organizations. It reviews AM in HRM systems, highlighting the interlocking nature, dispersion to new actors, and strategic misalignment of AM-based HRM activities. Its review of AM and careers surfaces the role of algorithmic bosses, multi-actor signaling, and identity challenges that arise from the gray zone. In conclusion, the article summarizes its findings and proposes an agenda for future research.

This review article explores the distinctive characteristics of electricity demand in the industrial, commercial, and residential sectors, and their relationship to successful implementation of DSM. The constraints and considerations for DSM are characterized as technical, economic, and behavioral factors, such as process requirements, business operation constraints, and consumer decisions, respectively. By considering all three types of factors and their impacts in each sector, this review contributes novel insights that can inform the future implementation of DSM. DSM in the industrial and commercial sectors is found to be primarily constrained by technical considerations, while DSM in the commercial sector is also subject to economic constraints. Conversely, residential demand is found to be primarily constrained by human behavior and outcomes, highly variable, and the largest contributor to peak demand. This review identifies sector-specific opportunities to enhance DSM uptake. Industrial DSM uptake will benefit from technological and process improvements; commercial DSM uptake can benefit from enhanced economic incentivization; and residential DSM uptake can benefit from improved understanding of the interactions between human behavior, human outcomes, and energy use.

This study explores the intricate relationship between corporate governance attributes and Business Ethical Practices (BEP), examining how CSR engagement moderates this relationship across 386 manufacturing firms in the BRICS countries from 2010 to 2022. Grounded in Stakeholder and Agency Theories, the research investigates three core governance strands: diversity, structural, and process attributes. Using the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimator, the findings reveal that gender diversity and age diversity positively influence BEP, while national diversity has a negative association, raising concerns about the alignment of foreign board members with local ethical standards. Board independence and board size significantly enhance ethical practices, while CEO duality negatively affects BEP, emphasizing the importance of independent oversight. Among process attributes, board meetings and board tenure positively contribute to BEP, while meeting attendance shows a negative association, suggesting that mere presence without meaningful participation may not guarantee ethical outcomes. Notably, CSR engagement amplifies positive governance effects and mitigates negative influences, reinforcing its critical role as a governance enhancer.

To achieve this objective, the study investigates the mediating role of consumer engagement and positive emotions and the moderating role of altruistic values on the relationship between CSR and consumer engagement and positive emotions. Data is collected through a structured survey of hotel consumers in Pakistan. The results show that consumers\u2019 positive emotions and engagement mediate the effect of hotels\u2019 perceived CSR initiatives on consumers\u2019 green behavior.

Corporate climate claims are largely unregulated which means that they are often (perceived to be) misleading and deceptive. As such, corporate climate claims risk undermining, rather than contributing to, global climate mitigation. This paper takes as its point of departure the proposition that a better understanding of corporate climate claims is needed to govern such claims in a manner that adequately addresses potential greenwashing risks. To that end, the paper reviews the nascent literature on corporate climate claims relying on the use of voluntary carbon credits. Drawing on the reviewed literature, three key dimensions of corporate climate claims as related to carbon credits are discussed: 1) the intended use of carbon credits: offsetting versus non\u2010offsetting claims; 2) the framing and meaning of headline terms: net\u2010zero versus carbon neutral claims; and 3) the status of the claim: future aspirational commitments versus stated achievements.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate a component of the environmental impact of a high-altitude medical research expedition by totaling the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions calculated from as many direct and indirect sources as possible. Methods: Eighteen individuals flew from London to Bagdogra (via Delhi), and then drove onward to Lachung (via Gangtok) where they began their ascent on foot to 4,800 m (Kanchenjunga National Park, Sikkim). Several research experiments were conducted throughout the expedition, which required use of a laboratory centrifuge, solid CO2 (specimen storage), rechargeable laptop computers and battery-powered oximeters. International Civil Aviation Organization calculators estimated aviation CO2 production. Land emissions were calculated for Mahindra vehicles. Solid waste was weighed and CO2 emissions estimated for its incineration.

The financial report submission timeline is one of the important components in information disclosure that can influence investment decisions and market confidence. Profitability is measured using Return on Assets (ROA), the auditor's opinion is seen based on the type of audit opinion given, and company size is measured from total assets. This study uses a quantitative method with a multiple regression approach. The research sample consisted of 12 Food and Beverage companies listed on the IDX during the period studied, which were selected using a purposive sampling technique. Secondary data from financial reports and company audit opinions were taken from the official IDX website and the company's annual report. The results of the study indicate that profitability and company size have a positive and significant effect on financial report submission timeliness, while the auditor's opinion does not have a significant effect. This finding indicates that larger and more profitable companies tend to be timelier in reporting their finances, while the type of auditor's opinion is not a determining factor in terms of timeliness.

This gap heightens financial insecurity, emphasizing the need to meet asset goals by 65. Hyperbolic discounting, driven by present-biased preferences, often hinders this process, but empirical evidence for those aged 65 and older remains limited. Moreover, prior research has overlooked the varying impacts of hyperbolic discounting across different wealth levels. This study addresses these gaps by analyzing data from 6709 active Japanese investors aged over 65 (2023 wave) using probit regression. Wealth thresholds are categorized into four levels: JPY 20 million, JPY 30 million, JPY 50 million, and JPY 100 million. The results show that hyperbolic discounting significantly impairs asset accumulation at the JPY 100 million level but not at lower thresholds. This effect likely reflects the complex nature of hyperbolic discounting, which primarily affects long-term savings and investments. The findings underscore the importance of addressing hyperbolic discounting in later-life financial planning.

Third, financial literacy has a negative relationship with purchase intention, indicating that fans of virtual influencers with higher financial literacy are less likely to purchase virtual influencers\u2019 NFTs due to more critical investment evaluations. We also argue that financial literacy discards the consumption behavior effect from self-congruity variables on purchase intention.Research limitations/implicationsThe study contributes to the literature by emphasizing the significance of financial literacy on purchase intention under the self-congruity framework. It also surmises that self-image congruence does matter for the purchase intention of a virtual influencer\u2019s NFT. However, further research could validate findings by studying broader NFT investors, incorporating fandom and impulse buying variables and examining actual NFT purchases against planned behavior.Practical implicationsThis research is crucial for virtual influencers\u2019 NFT creators, marketers and fans by providing insights for evaluating virtual influencers\u2019 creators\u2019 decision to pursue NFT markets. The findings reveal that the creators of virtual influencers should reconsider pursuing the NFT market, as self-congruity may not be a driving factor. Notably, our findings imply that a virtual influencer\u2019s NFT is significantly different from a virtual influencer's merchandising business.Originality/valueThe originality of this study lies in extending the self-congruity within the NFT context, investigating how financial literacy moderates the mediation of ATB on the self-congruity-purchase intention relationship. It challenges self-congruity theory by showing that despite fans feeling aligned with virtual influencers, high financial literacy reduces the congruence.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-01-14", "synthetic_support_claim": "Fans with higher financial literacy are less likely to purchase virtual influencers\u2019 NFTs.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Financial literacy enhances the likelihood of purchasing virtual influencers\u2019 NFTs by fostering better financial decisions."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "a4c5934c7781454fb3b96915c313a58a404b9e73", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a4c5934c7781454fb3b96915c313a58a404b9e73", "title": "Exploring Consumers\u2019 Understanding and Perception of Sustainable Food Packaging in the UK", "abstract": "There is a growing emphasis on sustainability; however, not all food packaging fits this remit and consumer knowledge is typically lacking.

But up until now, there has not been any attempt to provide a thorough scientific mapping of the area. Therefore, by combining various knowledge systems, this study seeks to identify the current research trend.Design/methodology/approachA sample of 158 papers was subjected to bibliometric analysis in the areas of DFL or digital finance. Assembling, organising and evaluating are the three phases that make up the bibliometric analysis process derived from the most dependable and genuine sources, the Scopus database, and the Web of Science (WoS) database. This study was done using a scientific search technique on the Scopus and WoS databases for the years 2015 through 2022. The study made use of Biblioshiny, a web-based tool created in R-studio and part of the Bibliometrix package.

Researchers first concentrated on socioeconomic and demographic variables, but over time the subject expanded to include themes like influencing, promoting, and behavioural factors that affect digital financial literacy (DFL). This research shows the conceptual framework of the area in addition to its intellectual and social structure. This study offers crucial insights into subjects that demand more research.Research limitations/implicationsSince the current study is a bibliometric analysis, the usual restrictions on such studies apply. A meta-analysis, a thorough literature review and other methods would be beneficial for future researchers to develop a solid conceptual framework. This current research work's science mapping is restricted to the Scopus and WoS databases because this research includes more high-quality articles and has organised formats that work with the Bibliometrix application.Practical implicationsPresent research provides critical insights into saving behaviour, retirement planning, digital finance and the interdependence of these. This research highlights the most prevalent problems in the field and points in the direction of potential areas for further study.

Description Editor\u2019s summary China\u2019s high demand for online food delivery resulted in an increase in the use of disposable, single-use cutlery. Disposable cutlery increases plastic pollution, and paper napkins and wooden chopsticks contribute to environmental degradation that endangers wildlife and marine species and compromises human health. Informed by the literature on \u201cgreen nudges, \u201d which are prompts to promote environmentally friendly behaviors, He et al. collaborated with Alibaba to use its mobile food delivery platform, Eleme, in a longitudinal field study across China. Forgoing cutlery became the app\u2019s default option, was made salient to users in a pop-up window, and was rewarded with \u201cgreen points\u201d redeemable for planting trees in China\u2019s deserts. The results suggest that incorporating green nudges is a feasible and effective policy tool, because it greatly increased orders forgoing single-use cutlery without harming restaurants\u2019 business performance. \u2014Ekeoma Uzogara Defaulting to \u201cno cutlery\u201d and rewarding consumers with \u201cgreen points\u201d promoted behaviors that reduced plastic waste. INTRODUCTION Plastic waste is a global environmental threat that endangers marine and freshwater ecosystems worldwide. More recently, as food-delivery services became increasingly popular during the COVID-19 pandemic, the surge in plastic waste generated by single-use cutlery (SUC) has become a key environmental concern. Yet effective policies that control SUC waste are largely nonexistent, and it is important to find ways to encourage individuals to reduce their SUC consumption. Using data from China, the world\u2019s largest producer and consumer of SUC, we investigated how green nudges can affect individuals\u2019 cutlery decisions when placing food-delivery orders. RATIONALE From 2019 to 2020, three Chinese cities (Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin) introduced regulations that prohibited online food-delivery companies from including SUC unless it was explicitly requested. To comply with the regulations, Alibaba\u2019s food-delivery company, Eleme, changed its app in the following ways: (i) by adding a pop-up window that required customers to explicitly choose the number of SUC sets to be included with their orders, (ii) by setting the default for this pop-up window to be \u201cno cutlery,\u201d and (iii) by providing a small nonpecuniary incentive\u2013\u2013several Ant Forest green points\u2013\u2013to those who chose the \u201cno cutlery\u201d option. The green points do not have a monetary value, but if one accumulates enough points (roughly by placing more than 1000 online food orders), they can be redeemed in exchange for planting a real tree (under the customer\u2019s name) in a desert area in China. The changes in the app\u2019s user interface embody the concept of \u201cnudging\u201d from behavioral economics and social psychology, which describes approaches that change the choice environment (or choice architecture) or provide indirective information to influence the behaviors and decision-making processes of individuals. Using customer-level data from Alibaba in 10 cities from 2019 to 2020, we compared behavioral differences between the customers in the \u201cnudged\u201d cities and those in the control cities before and after the introduction of green nudges. RESULTS The green nudges, on average, increased an individual\u2019s share of no-cutlery orders by 20.1 percentage points, which was a 648% increase relative to the baseline group. Meanwhile, the green nudges incentivized a large portion of individuals to somewhat change their behaviors rather than encouraging only a small portion to change their behaviors substantially. Women, older individuals, frequent food-delivery-service users, and wealthy individuals were more responsive to the green nudges. Importantly, Alibaba\u2019s business performance was not affected by the green nudges, suggesting that this could be a highly cost-effective way to reduce SUC waste. Additional mechanism analyses revealed that the default change and increased salience of the no-cutlery option were the main drivers of the observed behavioral changes, whereas the incentive to accumulate green points to plant trees played a relatively muted role. We estimate that if green nudges were applied to all of China, more than 21.75 billion sets of SUC could be saved annually, which is equivalent to preventing the generation of 3.26 million metric tons of plastic waste and saving 5.44 million trees. CONCLUSION Our study provides compelling evidence that nudges can be a powerful tool for changing behaviors. It also suggests that private sector and platform companies can provide highly cost-effective solutions to promote prosocial behaviors among their customers. In this study, the costs of implementing the green nudges were almost negligible (i.e., several hours of work to redesign the user interface), yet the aggregated environmental benefits were tremendous. We thus recommend that other online food-delivery platforms, such as DoorDash and Uber Eats, try similar green nudges to reduce global plastic waste. Green nudges reduce SUC. The graph illustrates the trends in the share of no-cutlery orders (SNCO) among Alibaba\u2019s Eleme customers in three cities (Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin) before and after changing the app\u2019s checkout interface, with dashed orange and teal lines indicating the average SNCO.

Despite decades of research into this emerging source of environmental pollution, there is a paucity of direct evidence on the health impacts of microplastics exposure at a population scale. This paper reports the first empirical link between in-utero microplastic exposure and adverse birth outcomes. Our analysis is based on a compiled dataset of 3 million births that occurred in coastal areas of 15 countries spanning four continents, which we merge with a novel remote-sensing measurements of marine microplastic concentrations. We show that in-utero exposure to microplastics, particularly during the third trimester of pregnancy, leads to a significant increase in the likelihood of low birth weight. A doubling of exposure increases low birth weight hazard by 0.37 per 1,000 births, which implies over 205,000 cases per year globally can be attributed to microplastic exposure.

Peppers of the Roberta variety were used in the study. The heat treatment of the peppers was carried out under vacuum conditions for all the packaging methods. ATM (unaltered gas atmosphere) and MAP (modified atmosphere packaging) products were repackaged under aseptic conditions into a suitable gaseous atmosphere after heat treatment and cooling into an unaltered atmosphere (ATM), and into a modified atmosphere (MAP: 30% CO2, 70% N2). The sous vide thermal treatment was performed in three variations: 30 min/60 \u00b0C, 15 min/70 \u00b0C, and 8 min/80 \u00b0C. The peppers were stored at 3 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C until the bacterial count first exceeded 4 log CFU/g, but no longer than 24 days. The pH, TVC, Enterobacteriaceae count, and microscopic filamentous fungi count were determined in the products. A qualitative analysis of microbial isolates was also carried out using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Sous vide heat treatment reduced the number of TVC (total viable count) (<2 to 2.35 log CFU/g), Enterobacteriaceae (<2 log CFU/g), and the number of microscopic filamentous fungi (<2 log CFU/g) compared with control (TVC 3.54\u20133.86 log CFU/g). The use of heat treatment combined with the packaging of culinary products effectively extends the shelf life of sous vide peppers, from 3 to 6 days for raw peppers to 15\u201324 days for sous vide peppers depending on the heat treatment and packaging method.

This study aims to investigate the impact of different factors, such as green product design and innovation, green product entry barriers and green environmental awareness, on the success of green investment funds projects to finance environmentally friendly products. The research also investigates how green investment funds facilitate these factors to encourage environmentally sustainable business.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThis paper used a questionnaire to collect insights from 210 green entrepreneurs in Asia, Africa, Europe and America. The data were then investigated using statistical tools, such as quantitative analysis of green entrepreneur surveys collected from various industries. The relationship between green product design and innovation, barriers to entry, environmental awareness and green entrepreneurship performance was investigated using partial least squares structural equation modelling, with green investment funds as a mediator.\n\nFindings\nThe results indicate that every construct/variable included in the study supported the success of the sustainable business. The observation was made that the development phase tends to diminish the positive relationship between the success of green investment funds and green product codesign strategies. Implementing green product design and innovation improves the success of a green firm. Also, the progress of such companies might be hindered by entry barriers, and corporate performance is improved by environmentalism. This study found the role of green investment funds in promoting product innovation and positive environmental outcomes while reducing barriers to entry.\n\nSignificance of the study\nGiven these results, this work provides a theoretical explanation. Also, it gives doable recommendations for more successful green investment funds of environmentally friendly goods. The analysis emphasises the need for green product innovation and investment funds to mitigate entry obstacles. Corporate entities, investors and lawmakers receive pragmatic guidance on sustainable business practices.\n\nOriginality/value\nThis research, unique because of its multidisciplinary methodology and theoretical advances, examines the relationship between business, finance and sustainability. It provides valuable insights for academics, professionals and decision-makers, enhancing the understanding of green investment and entrepreneurship and offering practical global sustainable economic growth strategies. This paper investigates the impact of green investment funds on product innovation, entry obstacles, environmental consciousness and the success of green entrepreneurs.

However, it also indicated that nutrition and health aspects received inadequate attention from consumers, which is a cause for concern. Concurrently, the producers who participated in this study indicated that they prioritize sanitation and hygiene (53.8%) in their food production, citing regulatory requirements as the primary driver of this practice. It is regrettable that the majority of the producers (92.5%) lacked information regarding the nutrition content of their products. Moreover, they did not actively contribute (2%-11%) to controlling SSF levels except to respond to consumers\u2019 demands. These findings underscore the necessity for enhanced awareness campaigns and implementation strategies involving all stakeholders to promote healthier, ready-to-serve foods.

Unlike other multivariate time-series data, stock markets show two unique characteristics: (i) multi-order dynamics, as stock prices are affected by strong non-pairwise correlations (e.g., within the same industry); and (ii) internal dynamics, as each individual stock shows some particular behaviour. Recent DNN-based methods capture multi-order dynamics using hypergraphs, but rely on the Fourier basis in the convolution, which is both inefficient and ineffective. In addition, they largely ignore internal dynamics by adopting the same model for each stock, which implies a severe information loss. In this paper, we propose a framework for stock movement prediction to overcome the above issues. Specifically, the framework includes temporal generative filters that implement a memory-based mechanism onto an LSTM network in an attempt to learn individual patterns per stock. Moreover, we employ hypergraph attentions to capture the non-pairwise correlations. Here, using the wavelet basis instead of the Fourier basis, enables us to simplify the message passing and focus on the localized convolution.

Existing approaches encounter two primary issues: First, they often overlook the crucial role of capturing short-term stock fluctuations for predicting high-volatility returns. Second, mainstream methods, relying on graphs or attention mechanisms, inadequately explore the temporal relationships among stocks, often blurring distinctions in their characteristics over time and the causal relationships before and after. However, the high volatility of stocks and the intricate market correlations are crucial to accurately predicting stock prices. To address these challenges, we propose a Dual-branch Framework of Fluctuation and Trend (DFT), which decomposes stocks into trend and fluctuation components. By employing a carefully design decomposition module, DFT effectively extracts short-term fluctuations and trend information from stocks while explicitly modeling temporal variations and causal correlations.

However, existing GNN-based models, such as LightGCN and UltraGCN, often struggle with two major limitations: an inability to fully account for heterophilic interactions, where users engage with diverse item categories, and the over-smoothing problem in multi-layer GNNs, which hinders their ability to model complex, high-order relationships. To address these gaps, we introduce WaveHDNN, an innovative wavelet-enhanced hypergraph diffusion framework. WaveHDNN integrates a Heterophily-aware Collaborative Encoder, designed to capture user-item interactions across diverse categories, with a Multi-scale Group-wise Structure Encoder, which leverages wavelet transforms to effectively model localized graph structures.

Despite strong performance, LMMs are not directly suited for foundational discriminative vision-language tasks (i.e., tasks requiring discrete label predictions) such as image classification and multiple-choice VQA. One key challenge in utilizing LMMs for discriminative tasks is the extraction of useful features from generative models. To overcome this issue, we propose an approach for finding features in the model's latent space to more effectively leverage LMMs for discriminative tasks. Toward this end, we present Sparse Attention Vectors (SAVs) -- a finetuning-free method that leverages sparse attention head activations (fewer than 1\\% of the heads) in LMMs as strong features for VL tasks.

However, recent progress in big data and artificial intelligence (AI) are bringing a transformative big data and AI-driven product design methodology with a significant impact on many industries. Big data in the product lifecycle contains valuable information, such as customer preferences, market demands, product evaluation, and visual display: online product reviews reflect customer evaluations and requirements, while product images contain shape, color, and texture information that can inspire designers to quickly generate initial design schemes or even new product images. This survey provides a comprehensive review of big data and AI-driven product design, focusing on how big data of various modalities can be processed, analyzed, and exploited to aid product design using AI algorithms. It identifies the limitations of traditional product design methods and shows how textual, image, audio, and video data in product design cycles can be utilized to achieve much more intelligent product design.

A primary theoretical approach was also conducted to identify BDACs previously cited in the literature.\n\nFindings\nFour main subdivisions of BDACs were identified: management capabilities, infrastructure flexibility, talent capability and technology. Management capabilities followed by big data technical knowledge and associated with talent capabilities generate a flexible infrastructure to enhance SV. A dynamic capability perspective of knowledge and information is also required for SV.\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nDespite the opportunity of this research and the originality of results, some limitations have to be mentioned and can constitute further directives for future researchers, such as the problem of result generalization. First, this research was based in Saudi Arabia, and a comparative approach to defining BDAC on an international level can be more beneficial in providing an exhaustive list of these capabilities. Second, reliability issues, in this research can be addressed due to the use of qualitative data collection which is considered by many researchers as unspecified and can lack scientific rigor. Future studies can improve the number of interviews during the data collection process and data process using an advanced methodological approach. Third, the effect of BDAC in SV according to the hierarchical final modal is not quantified, future work can use this research model to appreciate each effect using a quantitative approach such as correlation and structural equation modeling while considering respondents with different profiles to take into account different point of view in this concern.\n\nPractical implications\nThis research enriches the BDAC and MICMAC literature and contributes to this aspect in three main levels. First, by providing an additional empirical asset in this field, this study offers by the way a new case to the big data literature on the banking sector. Based on the limited knowledge as well as results collected from different databases and rigorously analyzed, this subject was not treated previously and the author could not find similar studies with the same approach dealing with the key BDACs in Saudi Arabia.\n\nSocial implications\nThis research presents three main implications for policymakers and researchers interested in big data analytics (BDA) through a capability and strategic perspective. First, to attain SV, they should prioritize the development of interactive interfaces and open platforms as the primary step before collecting information and deconstructing it to guarantee the generation of knowledge and make decisions effectively. Second, policymakers must introduce organizational technologies in terms of technology management, technical knowledge and technology for decision-making. This requires simultaneous sharing and communication according to relational management. Third, the research conclusions have many critical managerial ramifications for banks in Saudi Arabia while considering the adoption of BDAC. The importance of BDACs (especially technical aspects) in shaping the decision-making to be strategically vigilant emphasizes policymakers\u2019 orientation by paying close attention to these aspects and specific training programs to facilitate the use of such technologies and guarantee strong security measures.

It is also a new tool for measuring firms' value. This study employs a balanced panel data set of 114 publicly traded agricultural and food firms in China from 2016 to 2022. It empirically investigates the relationship between ESG and financial performance based on shareholder primacy theory and stakeholder theory. Employing a two\u2010way fixed effects (FE) model, our findings reveal a U\u2010shaped nonlinear pattern in how ESG impacts financial performance. It differs from previous studies that found predominantly positive relationships: Specifically, the average ESG score for firms is 0.396, the median is 0.390, and the inflection point of the U\u2010shape occurs at 0.53. When firms' ESG investments are less than 0.53, the high initial ESG cost makes it difficult to transform ESG into financial improvement. However, once this threshold is surpassed, good ESG can convey an excellent reputation to the public and increase anti\u2010risk ability\u2014which, in turn, significantly improves firms' financial performance and facilitates long\u2010term development. Also, our study demonstrates that firms' ownership and different positions in the supply chain differentially affect the relationship between ESG and financial performance.

A convenience sampling technique was used to select these respondents. Both online and offline modes were used to collect the data. Moreover, to evaluate the theoretical foundation of the investigation, the researchers employed PLS-SEM (partial least square structural equation modelling) on 346 useable samples.FindingsThe outcome reveals that attitude, subjective norm and perceived behaviour control (PBC) are significant predictors, supplementary constructs such as environmental concern are not significant predictors, whereas ethical obligation is a substantial predictor of purchase intention. Consumer purchase behaviour, in turn, is influenced by consumer purchase intention.Practical implicationsThe outcome of this research could help the country\u2019s legislators formulate policies and programs related to current environmental problems faced by our planet. Marketers could understand the factors that drive consumers' purchasing behaviour towards green electronic products and design effective marketing strategies accordingly. Thus, by enhancing the company\u2019s green image, marketers of green products may potentially increase future purchases, all of which contribute to solving worldwide environmental problems.Originality/valueThis research confirms the usefulness of TPB in understanding Indian consumers' purchasing intention and behaviour towards green electronic products. It further extends the TPB by showing that new components, environmental concerns and ethical obligations influence Indian consumers' purchasing intentions and behaviour. Moreover, prior studies mostly used both additional constructs for green products. Current research used specific types of green products, i.e. green electronic products, as very few studies are available on these products that apply TPB, which makes this study novel. In contrast to previous research that primarily examined purchase intention, this study takes a further step by investigating the connection between intentions and consumers' purchase behaviour. It establishes intention as a precursor to behaviour, specifically towards green electronic products.

A questionnaire was created and given to the selected respondents. Females who were at least 18\u2009years old made up the study\u2019s population. In addition, using a sample size of n = 237 was warranted and appropriate. Data were collected from Karak, Tafilah, Aqaba and Ma\u2019an, four cities in southern Jordan. Smart partial least squares version 4.0.9.2 and SPSS version 26 have been used for data analysis.\n\n\nFindings\nThe findings showed that attitudes, subjective norms, disease susceptibility and cues-to-action among females have a significant impact on their intention to undergo BCS. Whilst, the benefits of using BCS have not been shown to have a substantial impact on females\u2019 intentions to undergo BCS. Furthermore, this study indicated that there were no significant differences between females\u2019 intention to conduct BCS and the control variables (age and education).\n\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nThere are specific restrictions in place. First, although the study\u2019s sample size of respondents was adequate, it would be advantageous to have a larger sample size in the future to improve the reliability of the results. Second, the BCS behavior in Jordan\u2019s southern cities was the sole subject of this study. Therefore, it would be beneficial to also explore other areas of Jordan. Third, only female candidates for BCS were examined in this study. It might be necessary to do a more thorough investigation to find the obstacles preventing them from performing the test. Fourth, the current study did not analyze the actual behavior required to perform the BCS test; instead, it sought to understand females\u2019 intentions for undergoing the test. Therefore, it would be beneficial to research actual female behavior toward BCS in the future. The current study also used a quantitative research methodology. Therefore, more study is required using qualitative techniques like focus groups, interviews and brainstorming to better understand females\u2019 intentions toward BCS.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nAccording to the author\u2019s best knowledge, this study marks the first effort to highlight behavioral intentions toward performing BCS in the Jordanian context. In addition, by incorporating extra factors obtained from the health belief model within the context of BCS behavior, the current study broadens the theory of reasoned action. This can be viewed as a significant contribution to the subject\u2019s theoretical foundations. Besides, the current study incorporated demographic characteristics and used them as a control variable. This can be seen as another contribution to the literature on health-care marketing in the case of BCS.\n", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-11-26", "synthetic_support_claim": "Attitudes, subjective norms, disease susceptibility, and cues-to-action affect Jordanian females' intentions to undergo breast cancer screening.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Economic factors significantly influence females' intentions to undergo breast cancer screening in Jordan."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "327990bfbd64db857d43c9b5abd004f73c517dd5", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/327990bfbd64db857d43c9b5abd004f73c517dd5", "title": "The Influence of Liquidity Risk on Financial Performance: A Study of the UK\u2019s Largest Commercial Banks", "abstract": "The Basel III regulations turned the banking industry around worldwide and created new challenges for banks\u2019 financial stability, particularly in liquidity management.

However, when users have heterogeneous preferences, a single platform may not be as effective as multiple platforms from both a strategic perspective and an antitrust perspective. We study the role of network effects and platform differentiation in the context of a merger between the two largest platforms for pet-sitting services. To obtain causal estimates of network effects, we leverage geographic variation in premerger market shares and employ a difference-in-differences approach. Our results reveal that although users of the acquiring platform benefit from the merger thanks to network effects, those of the acquired platform are comparatively worse off because their preferred option is removed. Network effects and differentiation offset each other such that at the market level, users are not substantially better off with a combined platform than with two separate platforms. These findings have strategic and regulatory implications as well as highlight the importance of platform differentiation even in the presence of network effects.

Secondly, the average sum of shortages over different scenarios is consequently reduced by 36% as the recovery of primary suppliers improves. Thirdly, the feeling of shortage unfairness between distributors is significantly reduced by applying blockchain. Fourthly, unreliable direct suppliers resume their supply due to the availability of timely information through blockchain.

The economic impact of e-wallets is unclear because they provide not only a conduit to external bank accounts but also internal payment options, including the ever-popular Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL). We open the black box of e-wallets by examining transaction-level data matched with merchant and consumer information from a world-leading e-wallet provider in China, the userbase of which is representative of the population. We document that internal payment options, especially BNPL, dominate both online and on-site transactions. BNPL has greatly expanded credit access at the extensive margin through its adoption in two-sided payment markets. While BNPL crowds out other e-wallet payment options, it complements credit cards as seen in the behavior of users with both e-wallet credit and bank credit cards. Exploiting a randomized experiment, we also find that e-wallet credit through BNPL substantially boosts consumer spending. Nevertheless, users, especially those relying on e-wallets as their sole credit source, carefully moderate usage when incurring interest charges, likely as an attempt to improve their credit score.

Combining the expectation-confirmation theory and the expectation-confirmation model and information systems continuance, we propose a model for social commerce, illustrating how social media is utilised in online shopping as a three-fold process (pre-purchase, purchase, and post-purchase stages) from a consumer perspective. The model consists of three phases: social commerce motivation, social commerce adoption, and e-commerce effectiveness. Using two rounds of surveys, we find that (1) autonomous motivation and controlled motivation have positive effects on social commerce information seeking and sharing, and (2) social commerce information seeking formulates consumers\u2019 pre-purchase decisions, thus affecting their actual purchase outcomes, repurchase intentions, and social commerce information-sharing intentions in the post-purchase stage.

Particularly in the workplace, AI is depicted as an unstoppable force that shapes an entirely novel labour process. Consequently, efforts to regulate its introduction and deployment are dismissed as futile or even regressive. This paper argues for a different approach. Firstly, it proposes engaging with AI within the framework of Fordism-Taylorism, reflecting capital's long-standing aspirations for labour intensification, opacity of decision making and separation between conception and execution.

A series of methodically planned and executed surveys was conducted to elucidate the evolution of online consumer behavior over the past decade. The objective of this article is to diagnose changes in the behavior of selected types of e-consumers from Generations X and Y over the last decade, and link them to the concept of sustainable consumption. The 2020 study employed a sample possessing attributes similar to the 2010 research study, maintaining the sample distribution in terms of gender, education, and age. Characterizations of the identified consumer types were derived from prevalent psychographic traits, attitudes towards oneself and others, behavioral patterns, and determinants of buying behavior. Four distinct types of Polish e-consumers were identified: HQ_type (those seeking the Highest Quality products), MS_type (those intending to Save Money during shopping), LT_type (those dedicating the Least amount of Time to shopping), and DP_type (those Deriving Pleasure from the shopping experience). The identified Polish e-consumer types were subjected to a comparative analysis spanning a decade. The findings reveal significant alterations in the behavior of e-consumers representing various types, with a trend favoring sustainable consumption. Generally, Polish e-consumers are shown to demonstrate conscious and sustainable consumption behaviors, such as effective financial management, especially evident in the MS_type group. They typically purchase products within their means, avoiding expensive credits to fulfill their \u201cneeds.\u201d Half of the HQ_type, MS_type, and LT_type e-consumers recognize the importance of budgeting and spending tracking for informed consumption, whereas the DP_type, who enjoy shopping, tend to overlook active financial management, perceiving it as a burdensome task. Over the years, a positive shift in the HQ_type\u2019s attitude towards spending management has been observed. A significant aspect of conscious and sustainable consumption involves planned purchases. More than half of the HQ_type, MS_type, and LT_type e-consumers adhere to ready-made shopping lists, while the more impulsive DP_type frequently opts to shop in-store without any preceding planning. This research carries both theoretical and practical implications. The repeatability of the studies renders them a fundamental source of knowledge about the studied populations over time, and serves as an exclusive means of learning about changes in market phenomena and processes in a scientific manner.

This paper aims to investigate whether and how the pilot policy induces corporate green technology innovation. Based on the data on Chinese listed firms from 2008 to 2019 and the relevant theories of economics, management and organizational psychology, we find that the pilot policy can promote corporate green technology innovation. This indicates that the pilot policy, as an external force, will encourage firms to improve their adaptability through green technology innovation which is one type of organizational change, thus improving their organizational effectiveness. The heterogeneity analyses reveal that the promotion effect of the pilot policy on green innovation is stronger among firms in high-carbon industries, firms in the mature stage and firms that are not state-owned. The mechanism tests find that the credit allocation effect and innovation compensation effect generated by the pilot policy are the key channels to promote green technology innovation.

This paper extends the debate by focusing on board gender diversity and critical mass theory.Design/methodology/approachThe paper gives a conceptual viewpoint on the issues raised in the literature on board gender diversity through a critical mass theory lens.FindingsFollowing the 2022 European Union (EU) directive, all EU member states will have to attain a 40% women representation on large corporate boards to achieve board gender diversity and what has been termed a \u201ccritical mass\u201d. However, the literature indicates that gender diversity benefits may not be achieved if a critical mass is not composed of independent women directors who create a voice that produces a collective action. The\u00a0authors highlight why a critical mass may not be achieved. The inconsistency in prior research linking corporate board gender diversity to economic performance may result from the critical mass of women directors not reflecting an independent collective action. However, as gender-diverse boards evolve, the authors argue that women will not just be seen as female directors but will be accepted on equal terms with their male counterparts and have an equal voice; gender will no longer be an issue and critical mass theory may then become irrelevant.Practical implicationsFrom a corporate communications perspective, this study will focus the minds of human resources (HR) professionals on the importance of the composition of women on corporate boards if the HR professionals wish to obtain the full potential benefits of board gender diversity. Theoretically, this study highlights the importance of critical mass and collective action when researching the economic benefits of corporate board gender diversity. Investment analysts may wish to look more closely at the structure of corporate boards and not just the numbers.Originality/valueThis paper gives a conceptual viewpoint on the critical mass theory and corporate board gender diversity, identifying that it is not just the numbers that are important but also the issue of minority independence and collective action, and this is, therefore, unique in this respect. Future research should identify if a critical mass (not just numbers) of women on corporate boards has been achieved. Only then that the linkage, based on critical mass theory, between board gender diversity and corporate performance/profitability can be made. Knowing whether board sizes are being increased to accommodate the added female directors would be also interesting, or will the new female directors replace existing male directors?

However, designing effective reward functions remains a significant challenge. Traditional static reward functions often fail to adapt to dynamic environments, leading to inefficiencies in learning. This paper presents a novel approach, called Self-Rewarding Deep Reinforcement Learning (SRDRL), which integrates a self-rewarding network within the RL framework. The SRDRL mechanism operates in two primary phases: First, supervised learning techniques are used to learn from expert knowledge by employing advanced time-series feature extraction models, including TimesNet and WFTNet. This step refines the self-rewarding network parameters by comparing predicted rewards with expert-labeled rewards, which are based on metrics such as Min-Max, Sharpe Ratio, and Return. In the second phase, the model selects the higher value between the expert-labeled and predicted rewards as the RL reward, storing it in the replay buffer. This combination of expert knowledge and predicted rewards enhances the performance of trading strategies. The proposed implementation, called Self-Rewarding Double DQN (SRDDQN), demonstrates that the self-rewarding mechanism improves learning and optimizes trading decisions. Experiments conducted on datasets including DJI, IXIC, and SP500 show that SRDDQN achieves a cumulative return of 1124.23% on the IXIC dataset, significantly outperforming the next best method, Fire (DQN-HER), which achieved 51.87%.

Likewise, firms that engage in higher REM practices are less likely to allocate resources to innovation (i.e., lower R&D expenditure) and have a low innovation output (i.e., fewer patent applications). Nevertheless, firms with higher innovation input and/or higher innovation output exhibit higher ESG performance. Finally, the corporate innovation input and output mediate the relationship between REM practices and ESG performance, suggesting that the positive influence of innovation on ESG performance helps to mitigate the negative consequences of earnings management practices.

Some posts elicit positive responses while others do not, which raises questions about what firms can do to improve social media user responses to FGC and achieve their business goals. This research demonstrates that the number of arguments (i.e., the product attributes listed in the promotional message) included in FGC tends to benefit utilitarian products more than hedonic ones, which has systematic effects on users' perceptions of and responses to the FGC. In the contexts of FGC, argument numerosity can be effective in mitigating the tension and uncertainty related to online shopping (due to psychological risk), but we argue this is only the case for utilitarian products and not for hedonic ones. To test our predictions, we present five studies that represent a mix of controlled experiments with fictitious Instagram posts and an automated text analysis, on Twitter, of thousands of real branded tweets. As predicted, the results demonstrate that argument numerosity reduces the perceived psychological risk (manifested in the uncertainty and tension associated with typical social commerce behaviors), which in turn enhances users' engagement with FGC and purchase intention\u2014but only for utilitarian products.

Along these lines, the purpose of this research is to understand the nexus between the board's structural attributes and sustainability disclosures in an emerging economy such as India.Design/methodology/approachThe authors investigate this link using the system generalized method of moments (SGMM) panel regression on a sample of firms from the National Stock Exchange (NSE) Nifty 100 Index from 2013 to 2020. This econometric framework controls endogeneity among the variables, which has been a gap in the previous studies.FindingsThe authors find that board structural attributes, like board size, gender diversity, chief executive officer (CEO) duality and independence, have little bearing on sustainability disclosures of Indian companies. However, the board of directors, through the board's company's social responsibility (CSR) committee, strives for sustainability practices in Indian organizations. The authors also find that larger companies are more willing to disclose on ESG efforts than smaller ones, but the financial performance of the smaller ones (as proxied by Tobin's Q) does not matter.Research limitations/implicationsThis study is restricted to a sample of large cap listed companies and specific environment, resulting in the non-generalizability of the findings to different contexts because countries vary in their state of economic development, internal policy, regulations and governance.Practical implicationsA mandated CSR committee has helped Indian businesses to publicize their sustainability efforts. Besides the frontrunner in CSR regulations, Indian organizations have paid least attention to the environmental pillar of the ESG framework. Accordingly, the board of directors should put more emphasis on the environmental aspects of their business' sustainability efforts to help achieve sustainable development goals (SDGs) in the medium term and net neutrality in the long term.Originality/valueFrom the standpoint of an emerging economy like India, which has statutory CSR mandates for firms, this research adds a fresh perspective on the relationship between corporate governance and corporate responsibility by employing stakeholder theory, which is further substantiated by the use of system GMM as a robust methodology.

Three different algorithms of machine learning, widely applied to model real-world phenomena, regularized least squares, deep neural networks, and random forest are applied for this investigation. Results show that the most important patent features useful to predict IC refer to internal determinants, such as the technological scope of the company (technological domains and International Patent Classification classes), the backward citations, and technical concepts. Some external variables are also relevant, such as the family size, a time-related variable, and the timespan between the youngest and oldest patent of the family. Implications from this article concern two perspectives. From a methodological perspective, the study shows the usefulness of machine learning approaches in simplifying the decision-making process as they reduce the number of variables to be considered to investigate the company\u2019s IC and they provide accurate and easily interpretable result. From a managerial standpoint, this article points out the few and relevant patent variables to be considered when dealing with patents and IC.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-10-01", "synthetic_support_claim": "The technological scope, backward citations, and technical concepts of patents predict innovation capability effectively.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "IC is best predicted by external collaborations and alliances rather than internal patent features."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "4d60464ed0db1ed9caf2ce54fc0e7d27436f3d88", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4d60464ed0db1ed9caf2ce54fc0e7d27436f3d88", "title": "A multi-scale approach to quantifying metropolitan innovation and recycling behaviour", "abstract": "Urban infrastructures and services\u2014such as public transportation, innovation bodies and environmental services\u2014are important drivers for the sustainable development of our society.

Questionnaires were distributed among 159 SME owners in Kediri, East Java, Indonesia. Hypotheses were tested using PLS-SEM. The results indicate that the adoption of the Internet of Things demonstrates a significant positive effect (p = 0.0000, T-statistic = 4.6695), improving real-time monitoring and operational efficiency. Blockchain also positively affects SME internationalization (p-value = 0.0085, T-statistic = 2.6427), enhancing supply chain transparency and ensuring compliance with international standards. In contrast, the influence of artificial intelligence is marginally significant (p = 0.0799, T-statistic = 1.7548), constrained by financial limitations and lack of expertise. The moderating effects of eco-digital learning show mixed results. It significantly moderates the relationship between the Internet of Things and internationalization in a negative direction (coefficient = \u20130.0651, p = 0.0475), suggesting that increased eco-digital learning may add complexity, potentially delaying the benefits of the Internet of Things. For blockchain, eco-digital learning enhances its positive impact (p = 0.0277, T-statistic = 2.2085) by strengthening the organization\u2019s ability to leverage transparency and sustainability. However, no significant moderating effect is observed for artificial intelligence (p = 0.2066, T-statistic = 1.2646), indicating limited integration due to resource constraints.

We study how an advertiser maximizes total conversion (e.g. ad clicks) while satisfying aggregate return-on-investment (ROI) and budget constraints across all channels. In practice, an advertiser does not have control over, and thus cannot globally optimize, which individual ad auctions she participates in for each channel, and instead authorizes a channel to procure impressions on her behalf: the advertiser can only utilize two levers on each channel, namely setting a per-channel budget and per-channel target ROI. In this work, we first analyze the effectiveness of each of these levers for solving the advertiser's global multi-channel problem. We show that when an advertiser only optimizes over per-channel ROIs, her total conversion can be arbitrarily worse than what she could have obtained in the global problem. Further, we show that the advertiser can achieve the global optimal conversion when she only optimizes over per-channel budgets. In light of this finding, under a bandit feedback setting that mimics real-world scenarios where advertisers have limited information on ad auctions in each channels and how channels procure ads, we present an efficient learning algorithm that produces per-channel budgets whose resulting conversion approximates that of the global optimal problem.

A typical objective of the auto-bidder is to optimize the advertiser's cumulative value of winning impressions within specified budget constraints. However, such a problem is challenging due to the complex bidding environment faced by diverse advertisers. To address this challenge, we introduce ABPlanner, a few-shot adaptable budget planner designed to improve budget-constrained auto-bidding. ABPlanner is based on a hierarchical bidding framework that decomposes the bidding process into shorter, manageable stages. Within this framework, ABPlanner allocates the budget across all stages, allowing a low-level auto-bidder to bids based on the budget allocation plan. The adaptability of ABPlanner is achieved through a sequential decision-making approach, inspired by in-context reinforcement learning. For each advertiser, ABPlanner adjusts the budget allocation plan episode by episode, using data from previous episodes as prompt for current decisions. This enables ABPlanner to quickly adapt to different advertisers with few-shot data, providing a sample-efficient solution.

However, the most significant impediment to MSME development in low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries is a lack of access to both investment and working capital financing. Due to a lack of essential track record, appropriate collateral, and credit history, MSMEs are frequently denied business loans by traditional lending institutions. In addition, SMEs\u2019 inability to access funding is hindered by institutional, structural, and non\u2010financial factors. To address this, both the public and private sectors employ indirect and direct finance interventions to help MSMEs in developing and emerging economies enhance and increase their financing needs. Given the importance of MSMEs in the economy, a comprehensive overview of and systematic synthesizing of the evidence of the effects of financial access interventions for MSMEs, capturing a wide variety of outcome variables, is useful. Objectives The objective of this evidence and gap map (EGM) is to describe the existing evidence on the effects of various interventions dedicated to supporting and improving MSMEs\u2019 access to credit, as well as the corresponding firm performance and/or welfare outcomes. Methods An EGM is a systematic evidence product that displays the existing evidence relevant to a specific research question. An EGM's end product is a research article or report, but it can also be shared via an interactive map drawn as a matrix of included studies and their corresponding interventions and outcomes. Interventions in low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries that target specific population subgroups are included on the map. The EGM considers five types of interventions: (i) strategy, legislation and regulatory; (ii) systems and institutions; (iii) facilitate access; (iv) lending instruments or financial products; and (v) demand\u2010side interventions. The map, on the other hand, covers outcome domains for policy environment, financial inclusion, firm performance, and welfare. Impact evaluations or systematic reviews of relevant interventions for a previously defined target population are included in the EGM. Studies using experimental or non\u2010experimental designs, as well as systematic reviews, are eligible. The EGM excludes before\u2010and\u2010after study designs with no suitable comparison group. Furthermore, the map excludes literature reviews, key informant interviews, focus group discussions, and descriptive analyses. Search strings were used to conduct electronic searches in databases. To ensure that the research team had identified a significant portion of relevant research works, the search strategy was supplemented with gray literature searches and systematic review citation tracking. We have compiled studies that are either completed or in progress. For practical reasons, studies are limited to papers written in English and are not restricted by publication date. Selection Criteria We included studies that examined interventions to enhance MSMEs\u2019 access to finance in low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries targeting MSMEs including households, smallholder farmers and single person enterprise as well as financial institutions/agencies and their staff. The EGM considers five types of interventions that aim to: (i) deliver strategy, legislation, and regulatory aspects; (ii) systems and institutions that enable financing; (iii) facilitate access to finance; (iv) deliver different lending instruments or financial products, including traditional forms of microcredit; and (v) demand\u2010side interventions such as programs on financial literacy. The map includes outcome domains surrounding policy environment, financial inclusion, firm performance, and welfare. Eligible studies must be experimental, non\u2010experimental, or systematic reviews. In addition, the study designs must have a suitable comparison group before and after the implementation of interventions. Results The EGM includes 413 studies. The majority of the studies (379 studies) analyzed microenterprises, such as households and smallholder farmers; 7 studies analyzed community groups; while 109 studies analyzed small and medium enterprises. There were 147 studies on interventions that targeted multiple firm sizes. Lending instruments/financial products are the most common intervention across all firm types. When it comes to the types of firms that receive the said financial intervention, the data is overwhelmingly in favor of microenterprises (278 studies), followed by systems and organizations (138 studies) that support better access to such financial products and services. Welfare outcomes have the most evidence out of all of the outcomes of interest, followed by firm performance and financial inclusion. Among all firm types, welfare outcomes are primarily targeted at microenterprises. With 59 studies, we can say that small businesses have a significantly large number of enterprise performance outcomes. of the 413 studies, 243 used non\u2010experimental or quasi\u2010experimental designs (mainly propensity score matching and instrumental variable approaches), 136 used experimental methods, and 34 were systematic reviews. 175 studies (43%) provided evidence from Sub\u2010Saharan Africa, 142 studies (35%) from South Asia, 86 studies (21%) from East Asia and the Pacific, 66 studies (16%) from Latin America and the Caribbean, 28 studies (7%), Europe and Central Asia, and 21 studies (5%) from the Middle East and North Africa. Most of the included evidence covers low\u2010income (26%) and lower\u2010middle income countries (66%), and to a lesser extent upper\u2010middle\u2010income countries (26%). Conclusion This map depicts the existing evidence and gaps on the effects of interventions to enhance MSMEs\u2019 access to financial services in low and middle\u2010income countries. Interventions directed at microenterprises with welfare outcomes have a significant number of research outcomes in the literature. SME evaluations have looked at firm performance, with less focus to employment and the welfare effects on owners and employees, including poverty reduction. Microcredit/loans have been the focus of a large number of research papers (238 studies), indicating the field's growing popularity. However, emerging financial interventions such as facilitating access to digital financial services are relatively under\u2010studied. Several studies also investigate rural or population in remote areas with 192 studies, 126 studies on poor and disadvantaged, and 114 papers on women. Most of the research is conducted in Sub\u2010Saharan Africa (175 studies) and South Asia (142 studies) so further research in other regions could be conducted to allow a more holistic understanding of the effects of financial inclusion interventions. Credit lines, supply chain finance, and trade financing, which are some of the ADB's financial tools have limited evidence. Future studies should look into strategy, law, and regulation interventions, as well as interventions targeted at SMEs, and examine policy and regulatory environment outcomes as well as welfare outcomes. Interventions on the demand side and their impact on the policy and regulatory environment, as well as facilitating access are relatively understudied.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-07-05", "synthetic_support_claim": "Emerging financial interventions such as digital financial services are relatively under-studied for MSMEs.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Universal access to finance leads to significant poverty reduction among MSME owners and employees."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "63489c1187b8ab1dc68fc6b1574390114d196e7b", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/63489c1187b8ab1dc68fc6b1574390114d196e7b", "title": "The Impact of Financial Literacy, Inclusion, and Access on Msme Growth and Welfare in North Sumatra: A Mediating Role of Business Growth", "abstract": "This study examines the impact of financial literacy, financial inclusion, and financial access on the growth and welfare of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in North Sumatra, Indonesia, with business growth acting as a mediating factor.

These emerge as breakdown products of larger plastics and are omnipresent in marine, freshwater, and terrestrial ecosystems. They are primarily composed of polymers such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, and additives that enhance their performance. MPs also adsorb harmful environmental chemicals like persistent organic pollutants and heavy metals, posing risks to human and environmental health. Human exposure to MPs occurs mainly through ingestion and inhalation, with MPs detected in food products, water, and even the air. MPs have been shown to accumulate in the gastrointestinal tract, disrupting the gut microbiome, and causing dysbiosis-a harmful imbalance between beneficial and harmful bacteria. This disruption has been linked to various health issues, including gastrointestinal disorders, systemic inflammation, and chronic diseases. Furthermore, the gut-brain axis may be affected, with potential neuroinflammatory consequences. As research continues to unravel the health impacts of MP exposure, understanding the mechanisms of accumulation and the broader implications on human health is crucial. This review highlights the effects of MPs on human health, emphasizing their impact on the gut microbiome. We discuss the potential connections between MP exposure and cardiometabolic and inflammatory diseases, and disorders related to the Gut-Brain Axis.

This realization identified plastic pollution as one of the major global environmental issues. Majorities of plastic debris are neither recycled nor incinerated, as a result, it eventually makes its way into lakes, rivers, and oceans. Analysis of water and sediment worldwide indicates that microplastics and nanoplastic are ubiquitous in soils, freshwater, and marine ecosystems. Microplastic and nanoplastics are distributed throughout marine environments via processes such as biofouling and chemical leaching, contaminating both pelagic and benthic species. Despite growing recognition of the hazards posed by microplastics and nanoplastics, regulatory efforts remain hampered by limited understanding of their broader ecological impacts, particularly how diverse factors translate into population declines and ecosystem disruptions. This review examines the pathways of microplastic and nanoplastic pollution, their interactions with other environmental stressors such as climate change and chemical pollution, and their effects on marine food webs. The review highlights the urgent need for further research into the behavior and fate of nanoplastics, which are the degradation product of microplastics, owing to their nano size they pose additional risks, unique properties, and potential for widespread ecological impacts. Studies have demonstrated that smaller microplastics and nanoplastics, particularly nanoplastics, are more toxic than larger microplastics. Additionally, microplastics and nanoplastics serve as vectors for contaminants such as heavy metals, exacerbating their toxicity. They also translocate through marine food chains, posing potential health risks. While evidence of their impact continues to grow, the chronic toxicity of microplastics and nanoplastics remains poorly understood, emphasizing the need for further research, particularly at the cellular level, to fully understand their effects on marine ecosystems and human health. This review also concludes with a call for standardized measurement methods, effective mitigation strategies, and enhanced international cooperation to combat this escalating threat. Future research should prioritize the complex interactions between microplastics and nanoplastics, other pollutants, and marine ecosystems, with the ultimate goal of developing holistic approaches to manage and mitigate the impact of plastic pollution. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Microplastic/nanoplastic translocate through marine food webs, affecting species and human health.

Moreover, consumers who identify more strongly as feminists are more likely to pay more for women-owned restaurants when purplewashing is absent (vs present). Additionally, psychological closeness serves as an underlying mechanism that explains these effects.\n\nPractical implications\nThis study provides clear and actionable recommendations to help business stakeholders, owners and managers to market and advertise women-owned restaurants. For example, women-owned restaurant practitioners should feature women empowerment messaging in their advertisements to attract more consumers. However, they should avoid using purplewashing and other inauthentic brand activism practices in advertisements.\n\nOriginality/value\nThis research contributes to the hospitality literature on women entrepreneurship by exploring the effective marketing strategies of women-owned restaurants and investigating how to advertise women-owned businesses in the hospitality field. To the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge, it is also the very first study to explore the role of femvertising and purplewashing in consumers\u2019 food-related decision-making.\n", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-10-25", "synthetic_support_claim": "Femvertising increases consumers' willingness to pay a premium at women-owned restaurants compared to non-women-owned restaurants.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Femvertising leads to long-term customer loyalty and repeat patronage for women-owned restaurants independent of other factors."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "ca905c3f24b0f91ffa5d37b0784d4fc8e7bc9f39", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ca905c3f24b0f91ffa5d37b0784d4fc8e7bc9f39", "title": "Women\u2019s career and imposter syndrome: moderating effects of female role model and diversity management in the hospitality and tourism sector", "abstract": "\nPurpose\nThis study aims to examine the influence of imposter syndrome on women\u2019s careers in the hospitality and tourism industry drawing on the role congruity theory of prejudice.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nEmploying cross-sectional design, this research analyzed quantitative data from 574 women at various managerial levels using the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) technique.\n\n\nFindings\nThe results show that imposter syndrome significantly impacts women employees\u2019 engagement and organizational commitment.

By leveraging random forest (RF), long short-term memory (LSTM), and bi-directional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) models, the cryptocurrency trading system is equipped with strong predictive capacity and is able to optimize trading strategies for Bitcoin. The up-to-date price prediction information obtained by the machine learning model is incorporated by custom oracle contracts and is transmitted to portfolio smart contracts. The integration of smart contracts and on-chain oracles ensures transparency and security, allowing real-time verification of portfolio management.

Data was collected from Kuwait (n = 1,132) and the UAE (n = 190). Different statistical analyses and structured equation modeling-based analysis of moment structure are used to test the robustness of the research model.\n\n\nFindings\nThis study found customer satisfaction to be most important factor that mediates the effect independent factors on eWoM for s-commerce in both countries. Surprisingly, perceived enjoyment has no effect, and trust in Instagram and perceived risks are the most important factors that are considered imperative for customer satisfaction and positive feedback.\n\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nOne limitation of this study is that the author does not focus on the difference between the effects of textual and graphical information on customers\u2019 decisions and trust in buying merchandise. Another limitation is that this study focuses on Kuwait and the UAE. Other Gulf Cooperation Council countries are also growing exponentially, and mobile and internet penetration rates are booming; they could be a trigger for more studies on whether differences occur among all of them.\n\n\nPractical implications\nThe first implication is that it is the first in its field to extend the effects of eWoM. To the best of the author\u2019s knowledge, compared to the online research this study is unique because the authors examine six factors for eWoM in s-commerce using the Instagram platform as opposed to other platforms.\n\n\nSocial implications\nThe third implication of this study is that the previous ones have applied eWoM to different subjects of e-commerce such as tourism and marketing but have concentrated less on s-commerce, where in-depth research is needed much more to explore factors and theories that explain human behavior.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nFurthermore, most of these studies have focused on the intention to use (Dincer and Dincer, 2023; X.

This method first uses semantic differential and statistical methods to obtain users\u2019 evaluative vocabulary for the product\u2019s perceptual imagery. Then, morphological analysis and cluster analysis are employed to establish typical product samples and extract styling elements to create a styling feature library. Perceptual imagery ratings of these styling features are obtained through expert evaluation. fsQCA is then used to analyze the different grouping relationships between styling elements and their influence on product styling imagery, aiming to match user intentions through different element combination paths. The results show that this method achieves a consistency value of 0.9 for the most optimal styling configurations, demonstrating that fsQCA can effectively identify the multiple paths of product styling elements that meet users\u2019 needs. The contributions of this study to the related fields are: (1) providing a new perspective on the relationship between user perceptual imagery and predicted product styling elements, and (2) advancing the theoretical basis for studying multiple paths of product styling elements.

It also seeks to answer the question on whether the financial structure of a firm moderates the correlation between carbon emissions and firm value. We focus on analyzing data from non-financial firms registered on the GCC stock markets between 2010 and 2020. By applying the GLS technique, we assess the impact of carbon emissions on firm value and examine the manner in which a firm\u2019s financial structure either enhances or hinders this relationship. The results demonstrate that there is a strong and adverse connection between carbon emissions and corporate value, as increased emissions translate into lower corporate value. The study then moves on to emphasize the critical role that capital financing plays in mitigating the detrimental effects of carbon emissions. This is accomplished by balancing both debt and equity in terms of their proper proportions (optimal capital structure). However, excessive borrowing could have adverse consequences in terms of carbon emissions on company value. Moreover, the GMM estimator is also applied to carry out a robustness check and the results are consistent with the main findings. This study highlights the significance of financial strategy in advancing sustainability and protecting business value. These findings are supported by both stakeholder and signaling theory, proving that companies can use their capital financing to signal their dedication to sustainability. These results could be used by GCC policymakers to create rules and regulations that encourage environmentally friendly corporate activities and efforts to lower emissions. The research expands the existing literature by examining the difficulties and opportunities faced by GCC firms when combining financial strategy with environmental objectives.

The Impact of Disclosing Human Involvement on Customer Interactions with Hybrid Service Agents", "abstract": "To leverage the complementary strengths of humans and artificial intelligence (AI) in online service encounters, firms have begun to use hybrid service agents: combinations of AI agents (e.g., chatbots) and human agents (e.g., service employees) behind a single interface. However, it is unclear whether firms should be transparent about behind-the-scenes employees working in tandem with an AI-based chatbot to serve customers. Against this backdrop, we investigated the impact of human involvement disclosure on customer interactions with hybrid service agents. Our findings suggest that disclosing human involvement before or during an interaction with the hybrid service agent leads customers to adopt a more human-oriented communication style. This effect is driven by impression management concerns that are activated when customers become aware of humans working in tandem with the chatbot. The more human-oriented communication style ultimately increases employee workload because fewer customer requests can be handled automatically by the chatbot and must be delegated to a human. These findings provide novel insights into how and why disclosing human involvement affects customer communication behavior, reveal its negative consequences for employees working in tandem with a chatbot, and highlight the potential costs and benefits of providing transparency in customer\u2013hybrid service agent interactions.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-08-23", "synthetic_support_claim": "Disclosing human involvement leads customers to adopt a more human-oriented communication style with hybrid agents.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Disclosing human involvement with AI chatbots improves customer satisfaction with hybrid service agent interactions."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "3b07e44e9ec96d0091a3ec6c8884d48e56ddd849", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3b07e44e9ec96d0091a3ec6c8884d48e56ddd849", "title": "Toward Design Perspectives of AI Chatbots", "abstract": "This paper represents a perspective on the design of AI chatbots with respect to the concept of method engineering.

This paper argues that there are various barriers to implementing blockchain technology in the cold supply chain and aims to develop and validate a model for overcoming key barriers to implementing blockchain technology in the cold supply chain.Design/methodology/approachThe adoption of blockchain technology was proposed through interpretive structural modeling (ISM) and further it is validated using structural equation modeling (SEM).FindingsIn this study, ten key barriers to implementing blockchain technology in the cold supply chain were identified, modelled and analysed. Poor leadership style of top management was found to be the most important barriers to implementing blockchain technology in the cold supply chain. The results of SEM indicate that all the paths are supported. The findings showcase the barriers responsible for the lack of blockchain technology infrastructure that ultimately impacts the cold supply chains.Practical implicationsThis study highlights the fact that the fate of blockchain technology infrastructure development depends on the leadership style of top management. Demonstrating good leadership style by top management can help overcome the barriers. A good leader pulls the entire team instead of pushing the team. A\u00a0good leader can guide the entire team to improve IT governance, financial investment, digital footprint, digital readiness, skills and collaboration with service providers to implement blockchain technology.

Such is the effect that supply chains are disrupted to the point of failure, supply is halted and its adverse effect is seen on the consumer. While previous literature has extensively studied risk and resilience through mathematical modelling, this study aims to envision a novel supply chain model that integrates blockchain to support visibility and recovery resilience strategies.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThe stochastic bi-objective (cost and shortage utility) optimisation-based mixed-integer linear programming model integrates blockchain through a binary variable, which activates at a particular threshold risk-averse level of the decision-maker.\n\nFindings\nFirstly, visibility is improved, as identified by the average reduction of penalties by 36% over the different scenarios. Secondly, the average sum of shortages over different scenarios is consequently reduced by 36% as the recovery of primary suppliers improves. Thirdly, the feeling of shortage unfairness between distributors is significantly reduced by applying blockchain. Fourthly, unreliable direct suppliers resume their supply due to the availability of timely information through blockchain. Lastly, reliance on backup suppliers is reduced as direct suppliers recover conveniently.\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nThe findings indicate that blockchain can enhance visibility and recovery even under high-impact disruption conditions. Furthermore, the study introduces a unique metric for measuring visibility, i.e. penalty costs (lower penalty costs indicate higher visibility and vice versa). The study also improves upon shortages and recoveries reported in prior literature by 6%. Finally, blockchain application caters to the literature on shortage unfairness by significantly reducing the feeling of shortage unfairness among distributors.\n\nPractical implications\nThis study establishes blockchain as a pro-resilience technology. It advocates that organisations focus on investing in blockchain to enhance their visibility and recovery, as it effectively reduces absolute shortages and feelings of shortage unfairness while improving recovery and visibility.\n\nOriginality/value\nTo the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge, this is a unique supply chain model study that integrates a technology such as blockchain directly as a binary variable in the model constraint equations while also focusing on resilience strategies, costs, risk aversion and shortage unfairness.\n", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-11-29", "synthetic_support_claim": "Blockchain integration significantly reduces penalty costs and shortages by 36% in supply chains.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Blockchain eliminates all risks in business-to-business supply chains."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "905789c64e9d6d651487605b741efac3eebf04df", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/905789c64e9d6d651487605b741efac3eebf04df", "title": "A model for predicting factors affecting health information avoidance on WeChat", "abstract": "Objective WeChat serves as a crucial source of health information, distinguished by its highly personalized nature.

Particular attention is paid to software-based in vitro diagnostics (IVDs). With this point of view, a strong connection between DTx and IVDs is observed. Methods We investigated the current regulatory scenarios and reimbursement approaches adopted for DTx and IVDs. The initial assumption was that countries apply different regulations for the access to the market and adopt different reimbursement systems for both DTx and IVDs. The analysis was limited to the US, European countries (Germany, France, and UK), and Australia due to maturity in digital health product adoption and regulatory processes, and recent regulations related to IVDs. The final aim was to provide a general comparative overview and identify those aspects that should be better addressed to support the adoption and commercialization of DTx and IVDs. Results Many countries regulate DTx as medical devices or software integrated with a medical device, and some have a more specific pathway than others. Australia has more specific regulations classifying software used in IVD. Some EU countries are adopting similar processes to the Digital Health Applications (DiGA) under Germany's Digitale-Versorgung Gesetz (DVG) law, which deems DTx eligible for reimbursement during the fast access pathway. France is working on a fast-track system to make DTx available to patients and reimbursable by the public system. The US retains some coverage through private insurance, federal and state programs like Medicaid and Veterans Affairs, and out-of-pocket spending. The updated Medical Devices Regulation (MDR) and In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (IVDR) in the EU includes a classification system specifying how software integrated with medical devices, and IVDs specifically must be regulated. Conclusion The outlook for DTx and IVDs is changing as they are becoming more technologically advanced, and some countries are adapting their device classifications depending on specific features. Our analysis showed the complexity of the issue demonstrating how fragmented are regulatory systems for DTx and IVDs. Differences emerged in terms of definitions, terminology, requested evidence, payment approaches and the overall reimbursement landscape. The complexity is expected to have a direct impact on the commercialization of and access to DTx and IVDs.

However, current assessment and access frameworks, when they exist, are heterogeneous and fragmented. We analysed and compared health technology assessment (HTA) criteria for DTx across European countries that had assessed the same DTx products. This allowed us to conduct a direct comparison of these countries\u2019 DTx assessment frameworks. Methods A scoping review identified HTA DTx documents from European HTA bodies with specific DTx frameworks in place. The HTAs of the same DTx products assessed across multiple countries were then extracted and analysed. Results Deprexis and Velibra were the only DTx products assessed by multiple countries: Deprexis, indicated for depression, was assessed by Germany, the United Kingdom (UK) and France; and Velibra, indicated for anxiety, was assessed by Germany and the UK. There are notable differences among those frameworks, but what they share is an emphasis on the context-specific positioning of products within the disease landscape, choice of comparators and usage and usability data. Safety data are not a major focus in DTx assessments in these countries, but a request is often made for the addition and evaluation of risk-flagging systems. Conclusion The majority of European countries do not have a specific framework in place for the assessment of DTx, and major differences exist among recently implemented frameworks.

This study aimed to assess medical students\u2019 perceptions of plastic surgery as a specialty career and to examine factors influencing it, particularly understanding the impact of demographics, educational exposure, and media. Methods A cross-sectional study involved 777 medical students from diverse universities across Saudi Arabia. Students from both public and private medical colleges participated by completing an online questionnaire detailing their perceptions, exposure to plastic surgery, and career interests. Chi-square tests were used for the comparative analysis. Results The majority of participants were females, 64.2% (499 of 777), and only a small fraction expressed a strong interest in pursuing plastic surgery as a specialty, 10.9% (85 of 777), with social media and the internet emerging as influential sources of information. A majority of the students, 71.7% (557 of 777), acknowledged the impact of medical dramas on their career choice, while 42.3% (329 of 777) admitted to infrequently researching the topic online. Interestingly, while overall interest in plastic surgery was modest, preferences varied across clinical scenarios, with orthopedics and neurology/neurosurgery also receiving consideration. Academic performance, as measured by grade point average (GPA), did not significantly correlate with students' perceptions of plastic surgery. However, among female students, watching medical dramas was a significant influencing factor with a p-value of 0.001.

Methods: A cross-sectional questionnaire-based study was carried out at Liaquat University Hospital, Hyderabad, and Jamshoro. Participants included 108 house officers and postgraduate residents working in nonsurgical specialities. The study excluded doctors from other specialities related to surgery and dermatology due to overlaps in the scope of practice with plastic surgery. \u00a0Results: A majority of participants (79.6%) recognized that cosmetic surgery was a component of plastic surgery, while 12% considered them to be the same, and 3.7% disagreed.

This study, rooted in the psychology of sustainability and sustainable development, employs a primary prevention perspective to examine a relational factor, the leader\u2013member exchange (LMX), which might shield employees from exhaustion and turnover intention. Specifically, we propose a double-chained mediation model to investigate how high-quality LMX fosters a positive adjustment to employees\u2019 specific work modes, in-person or hybrid work, subsequently reducing employees\u2019 feelings of exhaustion and their intentions to leave the organisation. A convenience sample of 257 Italian employees participated in this study by completing an online self-report survey. Hypotheses were tested using the PROCESS macro in SPSS 25.0 (Model 6). The results indicate that positive LMX and adjustment to the work mode reduce exhaustion and turnover intention; furthermore, they highlight the existence of a more complex dynamic linking LMX to turnover intention through a double-chained mediation of adjustment to the work mode and exhaustion. Indeed, higher LMX quality favours adjustment to the work mode, decreasing employees\u2019 feelings of exhaustion and, in turn, their turnover intention. Specifically, the findings of this study add a novel contribution to the literature on the psychology of sustainability and sustainable development by emphasising the significance of positive LMX in becoming a factor of wellbeing and sustainability in the workplace through the promotion of the adjustment to both in-person and hybrid work modes.

This study explores the intricate relationship between corporate governance attributes and Business Ethical Practices (BEP), examining how CSR engagement moderates this relationship across 386 manufacturing firms in the BRICS countries from 2010 to 2022. Grounded in Stakeholder and Agency Theories, the research investigates three core governance strands: diversity, structural, and process attributes. Using the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimator, the findings reveal that gender diversity and age diversity positively influence BEP, while national diversity has a negative association, raising concerns about the alignment of foreign board members with local ethical standards. Board independence and board size significantly enhance ethical practices, while CEO duality negatively affects BEP, emphasizing the importance of independent oversight. Among process attributes, board meetings and board tenure positively contribute to BEP, while meeting attendance shows a negative association, suggesting that mere presence without meaningful participation may not guarantee ethical outcomes. Notably, CSR engagement amplifies positive governance effects and mitigates negative influences, reinforcing its critical role as a governance enhancer.

Study 1 compared eco-friendly storytelling with product-focused storytelling, considering perceived product aesthetic judgment as the moderator. Study 2 repeated the experiment with a founder story and a product-focused story, considering the perceived underdog as the moderator.FindingsThe findings suggest that the influence of eco-friendly storytelling, compared to product-focused storytelling, on higher purchase intention is fully mediated by brand trust. Consumers\u2019 perceived product aesthetic judgments toward an eco-friendly product can positively moderate the storytelling effect and brand trust. However, founder storytelling did not bring higher brand trust and, consequently, had no significant impact on purchase intention.

The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between corporate governance and corporate social responsibility as well as their effect on the performance of manufacturing firms via corporate image. The quantitative approach was used to collect data from a sample of 328 top executives of selected manufacturing firms in Ghana using the purposive sampling technique. The data collected was analyzed using AMOS and Process Macro. The study found that corporate governance has a high tendency to catalyze corporate social responsibility performance. The study further revealed that good corporate governance practices enhance both corporate image and performance of firms. Corporate social responsibility was also found to have a significant positive relationship with both corporate image and performance of manufacturing firms. The study further illuminated that corporate governance and corporate social responsibility have an indirect effect on firm performance through corporate image.

This essay examines the complex interplay between cost, usability, and sustainability in the context of packaging methods. The shifting nature of packaging trends from traditional uses to modern sustainable solutions emphasizes the role's flexibility. The sustainability imperative is examined, with a focus on how packaging materials affect the environment and how the regulatory environment is changing. Responsible packaging integration into supply chains necessitates multi-stakeholder cooperation, where manufacturers, suppliers, retailers, and consumers all work together to influence the course of sustainable projects. By transforming packaging from a passive defender to an active player in the customer experience, functional packaging innovations are being driven by advances in material science and user-centric design. The complicated balance between sustainability and financial feasibility is revealed by taking into account cost, including both initial investments and long-term consequences. Case studies from leading businesses in the sector highlight effective methods for implementing sustainable packaging while also highlighting the lessons discovered from difficulties encountered. Technological advancements transform the packaging industry by merging IoT-driven data and cutting-edge materials that support ecological obligations. The significance of packaging as a communication tool that communicates brand values and encourages loyalty has increased as a result of consumer perception and demand. The importance of packaging that connects with sustainability-conscious values is highlighted by the influence of the conscientious consumer on purchase decisions. But navigating problems like cost, convoluted supply networks, and consumer education calls for tact. The view for the future predicts trends including improved materials, digital integration, the adoption of the circular economy, and eco-design principles that will continue to influence supply chain packaging innovation.

We conducted a content analysis of the stand\u2010alone sustainability reports of 187 MNCs and 332 subsidiaries over a decade (2011\u20132020), comparing 1594 subsidiary reports with 983 parent reports. A path analysis approach assessed the mediating role of MNC parents, while random effects panel models assessed the moderating effects of local isomorphism and cultural distance. The results indicate that MNC parents positively and significantly influence the adoption of sustainability reporting practices by their subsidiaries. However, the successful implementation of these practices is moderated by local institutional context and cultural distance. Subsidiary transparency was positively influenced by industry characteristics and effective local governance, while financial constraints and the degree of alignment with international standards played a complex role in reporting practices. Our research indicates that MNCs need to adjust their global approaches to fit into local environments and improve the transparency of subsidiaries by utilizing industry\u2010specific tactics and robust local management. Policymakers need to prioritize enhancing local governance structures to improve sustainability reporting. This research contributes to the field of institutional theory by demonstrating how local isomorphism affects the dissemination of reporting practices within MNCs.

Reviewing progress to date in interventions that encourage less damaging diets or cut food loss and waste, we conclude that both are essential but far from sufficient. In terms of production, field studies from five continents quantifying the population-level impacts of land sharing, land sparing, intermediate and mixed approaches for almost 2000 individually assessed species show that implementing high-yield farming to spare natural habitats consistently outperforms land sharing, particularly for species of highest conservation concern. Sparing also offers considerable potential for mitigating climate change. Delivering land sparing nevertheless raises several important challenges\u2014in particular, identifying and promoting higher yielding farm systems that are less environmentally harmful than current industrial agriculture, and devising mechanisms to limit rebound effects and instead tie yield gains to habitat conservation. Progress will depend on conservationists forging novel collaborations with the agriculture sector. While this may be challenging, we suggest that without it there is no realistic prospect of slowing biodiversity loss.

Our paper focuses on CEOs, who are considered the strategic leaders of corporations, because of their crucial role in making important decisions.

The primary goal is to address these research questions: Do Asian industrial firms with female and male CEOs differ in their GI efforts? Is there a positive moderating influence of Asian industrial enterprises\u2019 size on the nexus between women in CEO positions and eco-innovation? Based on our research questions, firm size is likely a determining factor in the GI of female CEOs. This research employs rigorous econometric modeling to analyze a substantial dataset of listed Asian industrial companies from 2013 to 2022. We have found a significant positive correlation between female CEOs and GI in Asian industrial firms. It has been proven that female CEOs in the industrial sector are more inclined to promote environmentally friendly practices. Furthermore, the size of an industrial firm amplifies the beneficial influence of a female CEO on the firm\u2019s chances of engaging in GI initiatives. Regarding the moderating effect of size, the size of companies significantly magnifies the impact of female CEOs on GI. The effectiveness of female CEOs on environmentally friendly practices is more prominent in large corporations than in smaller ones. Our outcomes remain robust with respect to endogeneity issues using two-step GMM estimators. This study proposes that stakeholders, particularly in Asian countries, should promote the increased representation of females in CEO roles, particularly within large corporations.

In this circumstance, they must combine cutting-edge innovation to overcome growing sustainability concerns and technical revolutions to become smart farms. This study analyzes how dairy farmers might use cutting-edge technologies in their dairy sub-processes to determine the benefits of achieving additional productivity and efficiency. This paper examines precision livestock farming, information analytics, and alternative energy sources to reduce environmental hazards and increase resource efficiency. Using cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), robotics (RPA), Internet of Things (IoT), data analytics, system dynamics, and simulation modeling can assist the farmers in improving the results. Analyzing developing country case studies and best practices reveals crucial answers for reconciling sustainability stewardship and operational efficiency. The system dynamics method builds a simulation model and finds the projected results before implementing it in real life. The findings provide considerable waste reduction and productivity gains through technological deployments. The simulation model creates two scenarios of \u2018current\u2019 and \u2018technology-adopted\u2019 processes to examine the transformational benefits of sustainable practices.

Using panel regression analysis on Australian publicly listed firms from 2007 to 2021, we find that CSR performance positively influences financial performance. Furthermore, our industry-specific analysis uncovers notable distinctions. Specifically, within the consumer product markets, including recreational facilities, travel and tourism, lodging, dining, and leisure products, firms benefit from stakeholder rewards for their CSR efforts, leading to sustained financial gains. However, this positive association is absent for firms operating in industrial product markets, where stakeholders do not offer similar rewards for CSR performance. The significance of stakeholder engagement becomes evident in consumer market sectors, as firms with higher levels of CSR performance secure stakeholder support, resulting in superior long-term financial performance.

Variables specific to the industry might be significant in understanding these differences. This research examines the effect of CSR on financial performance in different sectors. Objective: The article aims to provide a thorough analysis of the impact of CSR programs on the financial performance of different companies. It aims to assess which sectors gain the most advantages from CSR initiatives and how industry variables impact this correlation. Methods: The study utilizes a combination of quantitative and qualitative analysis methods in a mixed-methods approach. Regression models were utilized to analyze financial data from 500 companies in ten sectors over a decade to assess the impact of CSR on financial results. Furthermore, case studies and interviews were conducted with industry professionals to gain a deeper insight into the operational mechanisms. Results: The findings show significant differences among industries in the relationship between CSR and financial performance. Industries that are highly visible to consumers, like retail and consumer goods, show a strong positive link between corporate social responsibility efforts and financial success. On the other hand, industries like heavy manufacturing, which have less interaction with consumers, demonstrate a less strong connection. Conclusion: The effect of CSR on economic performance differs depending on the industry. Increased visibility and interaction with customers enhance the advantages of CSR programs, suggesting that companies need to tailor their CSR approach to fit their specific industry.

Interestingly, while few studies suggest that engaging in unplanned purchase actions (i.e. impulsive buying) is not always associated with negative emotions among customers (i.e. postpurchase cognitive dissonance), others suggest that impulsive buying is directly associated with cognitive dissonance. This paper aims to investigate and understand the key antecedents of online impulsive buying among Moroccan Gen Z consumers, and how it contributes to postpurchase dissonance. The authors also try to gain deeper insights by investigating the disparities between males and females using mutigroup analysis.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nBased on data collected from 333 Moroccan Gen Zers, the hypothesized model was empirically tested using a partial least squares estimation.\n\n\nFindings\nFirst, the results confirm that impulsive buying is positively associated with postpurchase dissonance. Second, while hedonic shopping motivation, fear of missing out and materialism were found to significantly impact online impulsive buying, price value and online reviews had no significant effect on online impulsive purchases. The importance\u2013performance matrix also suggests that the fear of missing out is the most important factor leading to online impulsive buying, followed by hedonic shopping motivation and materialism. Finally, the results confirm that female shoppers are more likely to engage in impulsive buying behavior, and this was mainly due to higher fear of missing out, hedonic shopping motivation and materialism.\n\n\nPractical implications\nFirst, the study findings can help online merchants to construct well-designed online shopping platforms and effective e-marketing tactics to stimulate purchase intentions among Gen Z shoppers. Online merchants should also attempt to reduce the negative feelings associated with unplanned buying behavior by introducing additional incentives, effective consumer interactivity and flexible return policies. This would help online suppliers in retaining customers and transforming impulse purchases into more recurrent ones. Second, online retailers should take into consideration the differences between male and female consumers by appealing to the role of gender in purchase situations when marketing their products and services. Finally, the findings offer interesting implications to society by allowing online shoppers to make well-informed purchase decisions without being influenced by personal and products\u2019 traits.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nWhile prior research assessed the investigated constructs in separate models, the study suggests an integrated framework that incorporates different determinants of online impulsive shopping as well as its impact on postpurchase cognitive dissonance. Additionally, the authors explored the moderating effect of gender to gain deeper insights with regard to the disparities between males and females while engaging in online impulsive buying.

First, we undertake a comprehensive firm-level investigation (in a cross-country setting) to ascertain whether firms engaged in GVCs relative to non-GVC firms exhibited better survival instincts during the COVID-19 pandemic. Second, we uncover the heterogeneity of the shock across sectors and industries, considering the varied sectoral/industrial exposure to the COVID-19 pandemic.

For the bills the model deems as relevant, the model drafts a letter to the sponsor of the bill in an attempt to persuade the congressperson to make changes to the proposed legislation. We use hundreds of novel ground-truth labels of the relevance of a bill to a company to benchmark the performance of the model. It outperforms the baseline of predicting the most common outcome of irrelevance.

Institutional and stakeholder research suggests that firms may avoid the tragedy of the commons by aligning the interests of critical proximate stakeholders in ways that governments cannot accomplish. This phenomenological paper investigates this possibility by analyzing Amazon rainforest preservation by Natura, a Brazilian cosmetics company. The results indicate that Natura internalized environmental externalities by linking ecologically conscious consumers with rural Amazonian communities. A differences-in-differences analysis compares forest preservation and fire activity in the municipalities that Natura entered with those in which it did not enter. Natura\u2019s impact is identified through an instrumental variable analysis using missing satellite images, which Natura relied upon to decide which municipalities to enter. Quantitative results tie Natura\u2019s entry into municipalities with forest preservation. Analysis of three mechanisms associates Natura\u2019s involvement with stakeholder decisions to cultivate diverse forest-generated crops instead of clearing the land for conventional agriculture.

Furthermore, this novel piece of research explores the relationship between eWOM and purchase intention with brand equity as a mediator, particularly for branded apparel selected by Indian consumers.\n", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-07-13", "synthetic_support_claim": "eWOM positively influences brand equity and purchase intention with brand equity as a partial mediator.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "eWOM has no significant effect on purchase intention for branded apparel among Indian consumers."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "81d50c27b3807a97e6fb719b5a4e5502600b7f3f", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/81d50c27b3807a97e6fb719b5a4e5502600b7f3f", "title": "Impact of electronic word of mouth (e-WOM) on purchasing decisions: an\u00a0empirical study", "abstract": "PurposeIn today\u2019s fast-paced and interconnected market, companies must adapt to the evolving demands of their customers. Therefore, it is essential to examine the impact of online reviews on potential customers' intent to purchase. This study seeks to identify the characteristics of electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) that influence a buyer\u2019s intention to purchase goods and services.Design/methodology/approachWe used the snowball sampling method to collect data using a pre-tested survey instrument with a five-point Likert scale. We received 696 usable responses. We conducted assumption tests to ensure that we could use covariance-based structural equation modelling (CB-SEM) for data analysis. The collected data were analysed using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to compute the latent variables. We then tested our research hypotheses using CB-SEM.FindingsEight latent constructs \u2013 perceived persuasion, perceived information, image aesthetics, ease_of_experience, eWOM_credibility, eWOM_usefulness and eWOM_adoption \u2013 have been identified, which\u00a0determine the influence of eWOM on purchase intent (PI) for both tangible and experiential products.\u00a0Though the structural model emerged relatively similar, the constructs had differential impacts on\u00a0PI\u00a0for commodities and services. The perceived information quality and source trustworthiness had a greater\u00a0impact on eWOM credibility in the case of services than in the case of commodities, while image\u00a0aesthetics played a more crucial role in determining the eWOM credibility for commodities than services. In both cases, credible eWOM was found useful, but a persuasive eWOM influenced its perceived usefulness\u00a0more in the case of commodities. The likelihood of adopting a useful eWOM and converting it to positive PI is present in the case of both services and commodities, but the impact is much higher in the case of services.Research limitations/implicationsThe study has examined the interplay of three theoretical consumer behaviour models: elaboration likelihood model (ELM), stimulus-organism-response model (SOR), and information adoption model (IAM). Thus, it adds to the existing literature on the characteristics of eWOM that influence the PI of online buyers.Practical implicationsThis study\u2019s findings demonstrate how eWOM influences consumers' perceptions of the utility of goods and services, impacting their intention to purchase. It also provides valuable insights into marketing and consumer behaviour in the Indian market. Thus, this study assists marketers in adjusting their digital marketing strategies to ensure the effective use of eWOM characteristics to positively influence the PI of the target audience in the Indian market.Originality/valueThis research study examines the relationship between eWOM characteristics and PI\u00a0for both goods and services sectors. Most existing literature is skewed towards specific service sectors,\u00a0such\u00a0as hospitality and health care.

The combination of limited available land and increased demand drives house prices upward.Objective: To accommodate this, developers are increasingly constructing residential areas on the outskirts of cities, offering easier access to transportation such as trains and highways. These developers compete by offering competitive pricing, diverse housing options, simplified mortgage processes, and attractive promotions like zero down payments. Buying a house is a significant long-term investment, as property values typically appreciate over time. Therefore, a thorough analysis is crucial when purchasing a home. Several key factors, such as location, land size, building area, and property type, play a role in determining house prices.Method: This study adopts a quantitative approach, which involves systematically investigating phenomena by collecting measurable data and analyzing it through statistical, mathematical, or computational methods.\u00a0Result: This paper discusses the most effective techniques for data collection, pre-processing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

Coupling behavioral reasoning theory with a configurational perspective, this multimethod paper examines consumers' contextualized reasons for and against adoption of just walk out stores. Through qualitative field depth interviews (n\u2009=\u200960), Study 1 uncovers five reasons for (i.e., access convenience, transaction convenience, search convenience, no need for interaction, and limited social judgment) and seven reasons against (i.e., technology reliability concerns, entry inconvenience, payment unease, customer care inconvenience, privacy, contamination, and assortment\u2010related concerns) adoption of just walk out stores.

In response, loan insurance has emerged as a useful instrument to lift loan limits. To study the joint value of bank loans and loan insurance, this article investigates a supply chain composed of one supplier and one capital-constrained buyer who takes out a bank loan and potentially purchases loan insurance. The analysis reveals that both the supplier and the buyer can benefit from the bank financing with loan insurance in an insurance-cooperation region wherein the supplier is willing to reduce the wholesale price to entice the buyer to purchase insurance. Further still, in the insurance-cooperation region, worse contract terms of the bank loan benefit the supplier, whereas worse policy terms of loan insurance help the buyer. Such benefits can lead to a higher order quantity than the capital-abundant one and partially coordinate the entire supply chain. However, when production cost is low, the supplier and the buyer can encounter a Stackelberg prisoner\u2019s dilemma, in which both firms no longer cooperate with each other, and both are worse off. Nevertheless, a government subsidy for the insurance premium can not only reduce the Stackelberg prisoner\u2019s dilemma, but also improve the social welfare although it is not always optimal for the government to provide that subsidy. The main qualitative results are robust in a variety of extensions. This paper was accepted by Jayashankar Swaminathan, operations management.

However, medical institutions often exhibit reluctance toward data sharing due to apprehensions regarding data security and privacy safeguards. To navigate this conundrum, our research introduces and empirically validates a model grounded in evolutionary game theory, offering a robust theoretical framework and actionable strategies for facilitating healthcare data sharing while harmonizing the dual imperatives of data utility and privacy preservation. Methods In this paper, we construct an evolutionary game model involving medical institutions, big data innovation platforms, and insurance companies within the context of digital platforms. The model integrates exogenous causes of data breaches, endogenous causes of data breaches, compensation payments, government penalties, subsidies, unreasonable fees, claims efficiency, and insurance fraud. Results The stability analysis of the evolutionary game identifies eight equilibrium points among medical institutions, platforms, and insurance companies. Numerical simulations demonstrate convergence toward strategy E7 = (0, 0, 1), suggesting a trend for medical institutions to adopt a fully anonymous information-sharing strategy, platforms to implement strict regulation, and insurance companies to opt for an auditing approach. Sensitivity analysis reveals that the parameters selected in this study significantly influence the players' behavioral choices and the game's equilibria. Conclusions When breaches occur, medical institutions tend to seek co-sharing between platforms and insurance companies. This promotes enhanced regulation by platforms and incentivizes insurance companies to perform audits. If the responsibility for the breach is attributed to the platform or the insurance company, the liability sharing system will push healthcare organizations to choose a fully anonymous information sharing strategy. Otherwise, medical institutions will choose partially anonymous information sharing for more benefits. In case of widespread data leakage, the amount of compensation shall augment, and the role of compensation shall replace the role of government supervision. Then, the government shall penalize them, which shall reduce the motivation of each subject.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-11-06", "synthetic_support_claim": "Medical institutions will adopt a fully anonymous information-sharing strategy under the liability-sharing system.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "\"Real-time data sharing enhances patient outcomes significantly.\""}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "59985cde32fe4a1d1a7d9670b7b4d4e050797381", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/59985cde32fe4a1d1a7d9670b7b4d4e050797381", "title": "Dynamics of Deposit and Loan Volumes Model with Non-Performing Loan and Deposit Withdrawal Factors", "abstract": "Non-performing loan (NPL) and deposit withdrawal are two factors that can affect loan and deposit volumes in the bank.

Using a 2011-2022 dataset from A-share listed manufacturing companies on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges, the study employs multiple regression analysis with a two-way fixed-effects model to examine these relationships. Findings indicate that robust ESG practices significantly enhance company performance, mediated by green technological innovation. However, a negative moderating effect of corporate reputation suggests that higher corporate reputation weakens the ESG-financial performance relationship. Further analyses reveal that privately-owned firms, those in China's eastern region, and environmentally sustainable industries benefit most from strong ESG initiatives. This study addresses the challenge of disentangling key variables by analyzing their interconnected effects. The findings fill a gap in the existing literature by contributing to a deeper understanding of the relationship between ESG and corporate success, particularly through the mediating role of innovation and the moderating influence of reputation.

In cases where opportunities for diversification are rather limited, external knowledge that spills over from neighboring regions or from farther away might become an important driver of regional diversification. Despite the relative importance of interregional knowledge flows via collaborative work, we still have a very limited understanding of how collaboration networks across regions might facilitate diversification processes. The present study investigates the diversification patterns of European metropolitan and nonmetropolitan regions into new knowledge domains via technology classes reported in patent applications to the European Patent Office. The findings indicate that externally oriented inventor collaboration networks increase the likelihood that a new technology specialization enters a region, but this external orientation is less important for related diversification than for unrelated diversification. Further, the results demonstrate that interregional collaboration networks help diversification into unrelated technologies if external knowledge sourcing is based on a diverse set of regions and if collaboration is intense within companies located in distinct regions. Within-firm collaborations across regions can compensate for missing related skills in metropolitan and in nonmetropolitan regions alike but are especially important in nonmetropolitan regions. These results provide new evidence about the importance of knowledge flows within multilocation firms in the technological knowledge diversification of regions.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-09-21", "synthetic_support_claim": "Externally oriented inventor collaboration networks increase likelihood of new technology specialization in a region.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "\"Interregional collaboration networks are equally important for both related and unrelated diversification in all regions.\""}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "8014d070a99041fae8c1bd2020a0afd2242abe53", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8014d070a99041fae8c1bd2020a0afd2242abe53", "title": "Education, Science and Technology, and Talent Integrated Development: Evidence from China", "abstract": "Education, science and technology, and talent are significant factors driving economic growth.

This result reflects the need for high-quality audit services during the pandemic by such owners to improve their business decisions and limit agency-conflict issues. However, the analysis failed to find any effect of COVID-19 when it comes to family ownership.

Liking scores were not affected by gender, information provided to panellists (specifically that they were evaluating alcohol-free wines), and level of wine knowledge. Those who gave the highest scores were occasional wine drinkers and daily soft drink consumers. Conversely, non-wine consumers and non-soft-drink drinkers gave lower liking scores. Though these insights need to be confirmed on more samples of fully dealcoholised wine, they can assist winemakers in developing alcohol-free products and in targeting the right young consumers.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-11-05", "synthetic_support_claim": "Acceptability of alcohol-free Chardonnay is only achieved with 40 g/L added sugar, scoring 5-6/9.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "High sugar content in alcohol-free wines reduces their overall health benefits for young consumers."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "e42a388ddf669c732fb68fdf75eda9cd90c11006", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e42a388ddf669c732fb68fdf75eda9cd90c11006", "title": "Assessing the economic performance of agrivoltaic systems in vineyards \u2013 framework development, simulated scenarios and directions for future research", "abstract": "This paper introduces a framework for assessing the economic performance of agrivoltaic systems (AVS) in vineyards. The study aims to classify factors influencing the profitability of integrating photovoltaic (PV) systems with viticultural practices, emphasizing potential synergistic benefits. Focused on the geographic and climatic conditions of Geisenheim, Germany\u2014home to the first AVS installation in viticulture in Germany\u2014the framework highlights the need to explore economic and operational parameters to assess AVS feasibility.The study operationalized its framework by simulating various scenarios based on key variables such as capital expenditures (CAPEX), operational expenditures (OPEX), and revenue streams from grape and energy production. Key factors considered included solar radiation, panel transparency, and regulatory impacts. Scenarios evaluated included: i) Configurations with fully opaque and semi-transparent PV modules. Ii) Adjustments for full mechanization of viticulture practices. Iii) Self-consumption of the produced energy. The framework employed these simulations to evaluate economic outcomes and identify profitability determinants under different conditions.Findings indicate that under current conditions in Germany, AVS systems are not economically viable for widespread adoption. Key results include: Economic Outcomes: High initial costs (CAPEX) and insufficient revenue from combined grape and energy production lead to negative net present values over a 20-year period across all simulated scenarios. Profitability Determinants: CAPEX and energy prices emerged as critical factors, while viticulture-related costs and revenues had a minor impact on overall profitability. Potential Improvements: Scenarios incorporating multiple positive changes\u2014such as premium wine pricing, higher feed-in tariffs, and increased self-consumption of energy\u2014demonstrated potential for economic feasibility.The study underscores that high CAPEX and low revenues from grape and energy production are the main barriers to AVS profitability. For AVS systems to achieve economic sustainability, substantial reductions in installation costs, increases in energy prices, or technological advances in efficiency are required. Promising configurations combining multiple favorable changes suggest a pathway toward economic feasibility but highlight the need for further development and innovation. The framework provides valuable guidance for future research and investment strategies, emphasizing the importance of: i) Long-term Trials: To evaluate viticultural impacts and synergistic benefits. Ii) Dynamic Models: Incorporating evolving revenue streams, cost structures, and regulatory impacts. iii) Broad Assessments: Exploring the environmental and social benefits of AVS alongside economic performance. Continuous updates to the framework will ensure its relevance, reflecting advancements in PV technology, viticultural practices, and policy environments. This approach will help bridge the gap between renewable energy and sustainable agriculture.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-12-05", "synthetic_support_claim": "Under current conditions in Germany, AVS systems are not economically viable for widespread adoption.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "The integration of agrivoltaic systems in vineyards enhances grape yield significantly under all climatic conditions."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "da03a7b8cbe3e55a5f01f4a804c77902b6aecf65", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/da03a7b8cbe3e55a5f01f4a804c77902b6aecf65", "title": "Social Media's Effect on Millennials and Generation Z's Green Purchasing Habits", "abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of researching the impact of social media on millennials' and Generation Z's green purchasing habits is to better understand how these platforms influence their attitudes and behaviours\u00a0towards environmentally conscious consumer choices.
