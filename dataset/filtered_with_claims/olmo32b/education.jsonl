This rapid review of the literature aims to enrich our understanding of ChatGPT\u2019s capabilities across subject domains, how it can be used in education, and potential issues raised by researchers during the first three months of its release (i.e., December 2022 to February 2023). A search of the relevant databases and Google Scholar yielded 50 articles for content analysis (i.e., open coding, axial coding, and selective coding). The findings of this review suggest that ChatGPT\u2019s performance varied across subject domains, ranging from outstanding (e.g., economics) and satisfactory (e.g., programming) to unsatisfactory (e.g., mathematics). Although ChatGPT has the potential to serve as an assistant for instructors (e.g., to generate course materials and provide suggestions) and a virtual tutor for students (e.g., to answer questions and facilitate collaboration), there were challenges associated with its use (e.g., generating incorrect or fake information and bypassing plagiarism detectors).

Developing these LLMs involves a complex yet poorly understood workflow requiring training with human feedback. Replicating and understanding this instruction-following requires tackling three major challenges: the high cost of data collection, the lack of trustworthy evaluation, and the absence of reference method implementations. We address these challenges with AlpacaFarm, a simulator that enables research and development for learning from feedback at a low cost. First, we design LLM prompts to simulate human feedback that are 50x cheaper than crowdworkers and display high agreement with humans. Second, we propose an automatic evaluation and validate it against human instructions obtained on real-world interactions. Third, we contribute reference implementations for several methods (PPO, DPO, best-of-n, expert iteration, and more) that learn from pairwise feedback. Finally, as an end-to-end validation of AlpacaFarm, we train and evaluate eleven models on 10k pairs of real human feedback and show that rankings of models trained in AlpacaFarm match rankings of models trained on human data. As a demonstration of the research possible in AlpacaFarm, we find that methods that use a reward model can substantially improve over supervised fine-tuning and that our reference PPO implementation leads to a +10% improvement in win-rate against Davinci003.

Motivated by this, we propose Critic-RM, a framework that improves reward models using self-generated critiques without extra supervision. Critic-RM employs a two-stage process: generating and filtering high-quality critiques, followed by joint fine-tuning on reward prediction and critique generation. Experiments across benchmarks show that Critic-RM improves reward modeling accuracy by 3.7%-7.3% compared to standard reward models and LLM judges, demonstrating strong performance and data efficiency.

Specifically, energy loss in the final layer of a Large Language Model (LLM) gradually increases during the RL process, with an excessive increase in energy loss characterizing reward hacking. Beyond empirical analysis, we further provide a theoretical foundation by proving that, under mild conditions, the increased energy loss reduces the upper bound of contextual relevance in LLMs, which is a critical aspect of reward hacking as the reduced contextual relevance typically indicates overfitting to reward model-favored patterns in RL. To address this issue, we propose an Energy loss-aware PPO algorithm (EPPO) which penalizes the increase in energy loss in the LLM's final layer during reward calculation to prevent excessive energy loss, thereby mitigating reward hacking. We theoretically show that EPPO can be conceptually interpreted as an entropy-regularized RL algorithm, which provides deeper insights into its effectiveness.

The paper has a dual purpose, i.e., to build an effective classifier, ensuring accurate information dissemination in medical discussions and combating fake news, and to explore also the representational capabilities of various LLMs, especially concerning BERT, Mistral and GPT-4. The latter is investigated using the in-context learning approach. Finally, data visualization tools are used to evaluate the semantic embeddings with respect to the achieved performance. This investigation, focusing on classification performance, compares the classic BERT and several hybrid versions (i.e., employing different training strategies and approximate Support Vector Machines in the classification layer) against LLMs and several Bag-of-Words based embedding (notably, one of the earliest approaches in text classification).

Patients and health professional students commonly utilize these models due to their accessibility. The increasing use of LLMs in healthcare necessitates an evaluation of their ability to generate accurate and reliable responses. Objective: This study assessed the performance of LLMs in answering orthodontic-related queries through a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: A comprehensive search of PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Scopus, and Google Scholar was conducted up to 31 October 2024. The quality of the included studies was evaluated using the Prediction model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST), and R Studio software (Version 4.4.0) was employed for meta-analysis and heterogeneity assessment. Results: Out of 278 retrieved articles, 10 studies were included. The most commonly used LLM was ChatGPT (10/10, 100% of papers), followed by Google\u2019s Bard/Gemini (3/10, 30% of papers), and Microsoft\u2019s Bing/Copilot AI (2/10, 20% of papers). Accuracy was primarily evaluated using Likert scales, while the DISCERN tool was frequently applied for reliability assessment. The meta-analysis indicated that the LLMs, such as ChatGPT-4 and other models, do not significantly differ in generating responses to queries related to the specialty of orthodontics. The forest plot revealed a Standard Mean Deviation of 0.01 [CI: 0.42\u20130.44]. No heterogeneity was observed between the experimental group (ChatGPT-3.5, Gemini, and Copilot) and the control group (ChatGPT-4). However, most studies exhibited a high PROBAST risk of bias due to the lack of standardized evaluation tools. Conclusions: ChatGPT-4 has been extensively used for a variety of tasks and has demonstrated advanced and encouraging outcomes compared to other LLMs, and thus can be regarded as a valuable tool for enhancing educational and learning experiences.

To address this, we conducted a systematic scoping review of 118 peer\u2010reviewed papers published since 2017 to pinpoint the current state of research on using LLMs to automate and support educational tasks. The findings revealed 53 use cases for LLMs in automating education tasks, categorised into nine main categories: profiling/labelling, detection, grading, teaching support, prediction, knowledge representation, feedback, content generation, and recommendation. Additionally, we also identified several practical and ethical challenges, including low technological readiness, lack of replicability and transparency and insufficient privacy and beneficence considerations. The findings were summarised into three recommendations for future studies, including updating existing innovations with state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art models (eg, GPT\u20103/4), embracing the initiative of open\u2010sourcing models/systems, and adopting a human\u2010centred approach throughout the developmental process.

An automatically generated next-step hint can help them make forward progress and support their learning. It is important to know what makes a good hint or a bad hint, and how to generate good hints automatically in novice programming tools, for example using Large Language Models (LLMs). Method and participants: We recruited 44 Java educators from around the world to participate in an online study. We used a set of real student code states as hint-generation scenarios. Participants used a technique known as comparative judgement to rank a set of candidate next-step Java hints, which were generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) and by five human experienced educators. Participants ranked the hints without being told how they were generated. Findings: We found that LLMs had considerable variation in generating high quality next-step hints for programming novices, with GPT-4 outperforming other models tested. When used with a well-designed prompt, GPT-4 outperformed human experts in generating pedagogically valuable hints. A multi-stage prompt was the most effective LLM prompt. We found that the two most important factors of a good hint were length (80--160 words being best), and reading level (US grade 9 or below being best). Offering alternative approaches to solving the problem was considered bad, and we found no effect of sentiment. Conclusions: Automatic generation of these hints is immediately viable, given that LLMs outperformed humans -- even when the students' task is unknown.

Specifically, Scene Copilot consists of Scene Codex, BlenderGPT, and Human in the loop. Scene Codex is designed to translate textual user input into commands understandable by the 3D scene generator. BlenderGPT provides users with an intuitive and direct way to precisely control the generated 3D scene and the final output video. Furthermore, users can utilize Blender UI to receive instant visual feedback. Additionally, we have curated a procedural dataset of objects in code format to further enhance our system's capabilities. Each component works seamlessly together to support users in generating desired 3D scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the capability of our framework in customizing 3D scenes and video generation.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-11-26", "synthetic_support_claim": "Leveraging 3D scenes provides precise control over scene entities, resolving artifacts in video generation.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Scene Copilot can generate videos indistinguishable from real-life footage in all scenarios."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "15ddd8f674ba4c652cafdba2ece5dbe7ec6bc904", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/15ddd8f674ba4c652cafdba2ece5dbe7ec6bc904", "title": "The Impact of Artificial Intelligence Enhanced No-Code Software Development Platforms on Software Processes: A Literature Review", "abstract": "This literature review examines the impact of artificial intelligence-based (AI-based) no-code software \ndevelopment platforms on software processes.

It also discussed the challenges faced by teachers in promoting a healthy relationship with their learners. Globally teachers are faced with violent acts perpetrated by learners against them, and these acts disturb teaching and learning as well as their relationships. The paper which was couched in Critical Social Theory (CST), argued that human beings should be emancipation and liberated from the circumstances that enslave them. CST challenges the status quo and strives for a balanced and democratic society. It is concerned with the issue of power relations within society and the interaction of education, economy, religion, and other social institutions that contribute to a social system. The study adopted Participatory Action Research (PAR). PAR advocates for community engagements. PAR was adopted because it advocates for open, clear communication and critical self-reflection among co-researchers during action. The paper responded to two questions. What are teachers\u2019 perspectives on Religious Education in schools and how can religious education curb learners-on-teacher violence in schools? The study found that teaching RE in schools fostered tolerance and respect for diversity and teachers. In light of the findings, the study recommends that teaching RE at school requires reintroduction to curb learner-on-teacher violence. This study will bring a unique perspective on sustainable teacher-learner relationships through Religious Education and make policymakers aware about the significance of RE in schools.\n\nKeywords: Religious Education, Leaner-On-Teacher Violence, School Safety, Self-Reflection", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-11-28", "synthetic_support_claim": "Teaching Religious Education in schools fosters tolerance and respect, reducing learner-on-teacher violence.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Religious Education eliminates all forms of violence in schools."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "a8c71bae3edf7326c416bb4d45d60cb5ad5ff241", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a8c71bae3edf7326c416bb4d45d60cb5ad5ff241", "title": "Pandangan Hadis terhadap Fashion Celana Gomrong dan Korelasinya dengan Larangan Isbal", "abstract": "Fashion telah menjadi aspek integral dari budaya dan gaya hidup masyarakat modern, termasuk tren penggunaan celana gombrong (longgar dan lebar) yang kini banyak digemari.

Both researchers and practitioners have discovered that these tools can generate correct solutions to a variety of introductory programming assignments and accurately explain the contents of code. Given their current capabilities and likely advances in the coming years, how do university instructors plan to adapt their courses to ensure that students still learn well? To gather a diverse sample of perspectives, we interviewed 20 introductory programming instructors (9 women + 11 men) across 9 countries (Australia, Botswana, Canada, Chile, China, Rwanda, Spain, Switzerland, United States) spanning all 6 populated continents. To our knowledge, this is the first empirical study to gather instructor perspectives about how they plan to adapt to these AI coding tools that more students will likely have access to in the future. We found that, in the short-term, many planned to take immediate measures to discourage AI-assisted cheating. Then opinions diverged about how to work with AI coding tools longer-term, with one side wanting to ban them and continue teaching programming fundamentals, and the other side wanting to integrate them into courses to prepare students for future jobs.

An automatically generated next-step hint can help them make forward progress and support their learning. It is important to know what makes a good hint or a bad hint, and how to generate good hints automatically in novice programming tools, for example using Large Language Models (LLMs). Method and participants: We recruited 44 Java educators from around the world to participate in an online study. We used a set of real student code states as hint-generation scenarios. Participants used a technique known as comparative judgement to rank a set of candidate next-step Java hints, which were generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) and by five human experienced educators. Participants ranked the hints without being told how they were generated. Findings: We found that LLMs had considerable variation in generating high quality next-step hints for programming novices, with GPT-4 outperforming other models tested. When used with a well-designed prompt, GPT-4 outperformed human experts in generating pedagogically valuable hints. A multi-stage prompt was the most effective LLM prompt. We found that the two most important factors of a good hint were length (80--160 words being best), and reading level (US grade 9 or below being best). Offering alternative approaches to solving the problem was considered bad, and we found no effect of sentiment. Conclusions: Automatic generation of these hints is immediately viable, given that LLMs outperformed humans -- even when the students' task is unknown. The fact that only the best prompts achieve this outcome suggests that students on their own are unlikely to be able to produce the same benefit. The prompting task, therefore, should be embedded in an expert-designed tool.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-11-27", "synthetic_support_claim": "GPT-4 outperformed human experts in generating pedagogically valuable next-step hints for programming novices.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Introducing standardized hint formats improves students' programming skills more effectively than context-specific, personalized hints."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "00fb4157eedc203ec909f266ac4bf6724da5d4f4", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00fb4157eedc203ec909f266ac4bf6724da5d4f4", "title": "Directions for using Generative Artificial Intelligence in Introductory Programming", "abstract": "This paper provides a review of the literature on the use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in introductory programming education at universities.

Objective We aim to synthesize the status and opinions of using ChatGPT according to different nursing fields, as well as assess ChatGPT\u2019s strengths, weaknesses, and the potential impacts it may cause. Methods This scoping review was conducted following the framework of Arksey and O\u2019Malley and guided by the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews). A comprehensive literature research was conducted in 4 web-based databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and CINHAL) to identify studies reporting the opinions of using ChatGPT in nursing fields from 2022 to September 3, 2023. The references of the included studies were screened manually to further identify relevant studies. Two authors conducted studies screening, eligibility assessments, and data extraction independently. Results A total of 30 studies were included. The United States (7 studies), Canada (5 studies), and China (4 studies) were countries with the most publications. In terms of fields of concern, studies mainly focused on \u201cChatGPT and nursing education\u201d (20 studies), \u201cChatGPT and nursing practice\u201d (10 studies), and \u201cChatGPT and nursing research, writing, and examination\u201d (6 studies). Six studies addressed the use of ChatGPT in multiple nursing fields. Conclusions As an emerging artificial intelligence technology, ChatGPT has great potential to revolutionize nursing education, nursing practice, and nursing research.

While their fluency across a variety of domains is impressive, modern AI systems fall short on tests requiring symbolic processing and abstraction - a glaring limitation given the necessity for interpretable and reliable technology. Despite a surge of reasoning benchmarks emerging from the academic community, no comprehensive and theoretically-motivated framework exists to quantify reasoning (and more generally, symbolic ability) in AI systems. Here, we adopt a framework from computational complexity theory to explicitly quantify symbolic generalization: algebraic circuit complexity. Many symbolic reasoning problems can be recast as algebraic expressions. Thus, algebraic circuit complexity theory - the study of algebraic expressions as circuit models (i.e., directed acyclic graphs) - is a natural framework to study the complexity of symbolic computation. The tools of algebraic circuit complexity enable the study of generalization by defining benchmarks in terms of their complexity-theoretic properties (i.e., the difficulty of a problem). Moreover, algebraic circuits are generic mathematical objects; for a given algebraic circuit, an arbitrarily large number of samples can be generated for a specific circuit, making it an optimal testbed for the data-hungry machine learning algorithms that are used today.

In this paper, we introduce a synthetic learning task,\"FTCT\"(Fragmented at Training, Chained at Testing), to validate the potential of Transformers in replicating this skill and interpret its inner mechanism. In the training phase, data consist of separated knowledge fragments from an overall causal graph. During testing, Transformers must infer complete causal graph traces by integrating these fragments.

In this paper, we propose a simple curriculum-based technique, termed Curriculum Temperature for Knowledge Distillation (CTKD), which controls the task difficulty level during the student's learning career through a dynamic and learnable temperature. Specifically, following an easy-to-hard curriculum, we gradually increase the distillation loss w.r.t. the temperature, leading to increased distillation difficulty in an adversarial manner. As an easy-to-use plug-in technique, CTKD can be seamlessly integrated into existing knowledge distillation frameworks and brings general improvements at a negligible additional computation cost.

However, they often produce biased predictions caused by sensitive attributes, such as religion or gender, an issue that has been largely overlooked in existing methods. Recently, numerous studies have focused on reducing biases in GNNs. However, these approaches often rely on training with partial data (e.g., using either node features or graph structure alone), which can enhance fairness but frequently compromises model utility due to the limited utilization of available graph information. To address this tradeoff, we propose an effective strategy to balance fairness and utility in knowledge distillation. Specifically, we introduce FairDTD, a novel Fair representation learning framework built on Dual-Teacher Distillation, leveraging a causal graph model to guide and optimize the design of the distillation process. Specifically, FairDTD employs two fairness-oriented teacher models: a feature teacher and a structure teacher, to facilitate dual distillation, with the student model learning fairness knowledge from the teachers while also leveraging full data to mitigate utility loss. To enhance information transfer, we incorporate graph-level distillation to provide an indirect supplement of graph information during training, as well as a node-specific temperature module to improve the comprehensive transfer of fair knowledge.

Traditional machine learning, known as centralized learning, involves collecting data from multiple sources for the model development, which poses significant privacy risks. To address the conflict between the need for data sharing and the protection of privacy, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising solution. This approach allows for the continuous sharing of model updates between a central server and numerous local devices, fostering collaborative model development. However, it also brings about considerable communication costs and raises privacy concerns due to the potential for sensitive information leakage from the central server and local devices. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight and accuracy-lossless privacy-preserving FL scheme based on gradient clipping. The central server introduces noise to the global model to prevent clients from extracting valuable information, and then the local devices train these models using their data. To reduce the communication load, parameters with less impact on the model are removed using the Fisher information matrix. Additionally, to enhance privacy protection, the client-computed parameters are perturbed using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange method.

Proponents of the theory have developed interventions to influence students' mindsets, claiming that these interventions lead to large gains in academic achievement. Despite their popularity, the evidence for growth mindset intervention benefits has not been systematically evaluated considering both the quantity and quality of the evidence. Here, we provide such a review by (a) evaluating empirical studies' adherence to a set of best practices essential for drawing causal conclusions and (b) conducting three meta-analyses. When examining all studies (63 studies, N = 97,672), we found major shortcomings in study design, analysis, and reporting, and suggestions of researcher and publication bias: Authors with a financial incentive to report positive findings published significantly larger effects than authors without this incentive. Across all studies, we observed a small overall effect: d\u00af = 0.05, 95% CI = [0.02, 0.09], which was nonsignificant after correcting for potential publication bias. No theoretically meaningful moderators were significant. When examining only studies demonstrating the intervention influenced students' mindsets as intended (13 studies, N = 18,355), the effect was nonsignificant: d\u00af = 0.04, 95% CI = [-0.01, 0.10].

Monuments, archaeological sites, historical centres, and museums are progressively recognising the transformative potential of extended reality (XR) technologies. Among these, virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a particularly effective tool for communicating information and engaging visitors. These technologies facilitate the creation of immersive, interactive experiences that provide access to vast datasets, often difficult to explore within the limitations of physical settings. This study investigates these emerging paradigms, specifically focusing on the roles played by digital surveying, data interpretation, Historic Building Information Modelling (HBIM), and visual programming languages (VPL) in developing innovative VR solutions. These advancements allow for the transformation of static BIM into dynamic interactive virtual environments (IVE) and virtual objects (IVO), which respond to user input in real-time, thereby fostering engaging and dynamic digital experiences. A case study of the Ospedale Maggiore in Milan\u2014designed by Filarete in the mid-15th century and currently housing the University of Milan\u2014serves as an exemplary model of the potential of these technologies.

However, the impact of this technology on the quality of education is still unknown considering the risks and concerns surrounding ChatGPT use. Therefore, it is necessary to assess the usability and acceptability of this promising tool. As an innovative technology, the intention to use ChatGPT can be studied in the context of the technology acceptance model (TAM). Objective This study aimed to develop and validate a TAM-based survey instrument called TAME-ChatGPT (Technology Acceptance Model Edited to Assess ChatGPT Adoption) that could be employed to examine the successful integration and use of ChatGPT in health care education. Methods The survey tool was created based on the TAM framework. It comprised 13 items for participants who heard of ChatGPT but did not use it and 23 items for participants who used ChatGPT. Using a convenient sampling approach, the survey link was circulated electronically among university students between February and March 2023. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used to assess the construct validity of the survey instrument. Results The final sample comprised 458 respondents, the majority among them undergraduate students (n=442, 96.5%). Only 109 (23.8%) respondents had heard of ChatGPT prior to participation and only 55 (11.3%) self-reported ChatGPT use before the study. EFA analysis on the attitude and usage scales showed significant Bartlett tests of sphericity scores (P<.001) and adequate Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measures (0.823 for the attitude scale and 0.702 for the usage scale), confirming the factorability of the correlation matrices. The EFA showed that 3 constructs explained a cumulative total of 69.3% variance in the attitude scale, and these subscales represented perceived risks, attitude to technology/social influence, and anxiety. For the ChatGPT usage scale, EFA showed that 4 constructs explained a cumulative total of 72% variance in the data and comprised the perceived usefulness, perceived risks, perceived ease of use, and behavior/cognitive factors. All the ChatGPT attitude and usage subscales showed good reliability with Cronbach \u03b1 values >.78 for all the deduced subscales. Conclusions The TAME-ChatGPT demonstrated good reliability, validity, and usefulness in assessing health care students\u2019 attitudes toward ChatGPT. The findings highlighted the importance of considering risk perceptions, usefulness, ease of use, attitudes toward technology, and behavioral factors when adopting ChatGPT as a tool in health care education.

Currently, many centralized irrigation systems use a one-by-one watering approach, requiring multiple sensors to monitor each plant's condition, making them less efficient. To address this issue, this research developed an automated irrigation system controlled by Node-RED and robotic technology. The system is designed to require only one sensor to monitor the entire agricultural area, while still efficiently distributing water to many plants. Node-RED manages data from soil moisture and environmental temperature sensors, then activates the watering robot to distribute water according to the plants' needs. The system was tested by comparing manual and automatic methods using polybags. The soil moisture sensor sends data to Node-RED, which activates the watering robot when soil moisture falls below a set threshold. Test results show that the automated system can save up to 20% of water usage compared to manual methods, while keeping soil moisture within the optimal range.

Businesses and individuals worldwide are increasingly depending on ICTs to facilitate trade and enhance their standard of living. This trend has sparked the argument that ICTs play a crucial role in driving economic development. However, the rise of ICTs has also led to challenges, including cybercrime, intellectual property violations and cyberwarfare, prompting questions about the need for regulation. In spite of these pressing issues, there is a notable lack of empirical research on the relationship between the use of ICTs (by businesses and individuals), their regulation and economic development.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nBecause of the limited empirical evidence regarding the connections between ICT use, ICT regulations, and economic development, this study aims to explore these relationships. The authors specifically examine the mediating role of ICT regulations in the impact of ICT use on economic development, as well as the direct effects of ICT use on economic development. To achieve this, the authors develop a hypothesised model that is validated using the technology\u2013organisation\u2013environment framework and capability theory. Additionally, the authors analyse secondary data from 130 countries using partial least squares-structural equation modelling.\n\n\nFindings\nThe findings of this study show that both business and individual use of ICTs positively influences economic development. Furthermore, the authors discovered that ICT regulation plays a positive and partial mediating role in the relationship between ICT use and economic development.

In comparison to traditional classroom teaching models, smart education is a collaborative and visual model that adopts the latest AI technologies to reach a learning outcome. However, a problem that should be considered is how a smart education model, enabled by the Edu-Metaverse, can be developed to enhance better learning outcomes for students. Such a model should highlight smart pedagogy in the context of the Edu-Metaverse, together with a smart teaching environment, multimodal teaching resources, and AI-enabled assessment. In this study, we focused on the teaching of college English to 60 students from Zhejiang Open University. We investigated the effectiveness of a smart education model, which was empowered by the Edu-Metaverse, in enhancing better learning outcomes for the students, using a combination of qualitative and quantitative research.

However, not all teachers are prepared for this. Despite this, the sudden changes caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have compelled schools to adopt digital technology tools (DTT) to continue the teaching-learning process. This rapid shift called for greater support and training for educators to adapt effectively. Using a mixed-methods design, this paper explored the usage and effectiveness of DTT in science teaching in public junior high schools in Caloocan City, Philippines. Through purposive sampling, 41 science teachers from three schools participated by answering a questionnaire. It revealed that Messenger, PowerPoint, and Google Meet were the most used DTT during online teaching, while Messenger, PowerPoint, and Canva were the most effective. Messenger facilitates communication, PowerPoint enhances lesson delivery through visual presentations, Google Meet enables virtual interactions, and Canva allows teachers to create engaging and visually appealing materials. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) did not reveal significant relationships between demographics and DTT usage of science teachers; it suggested other areas to explore, such as years of teaching, which might influence their preferences for specific DTT like Messenger or Zoom. In the face-to-face classes, teachers continued DTT usage \u2013 most teachers used PowerPoint, Messenger, and Canva, which were also the most effective DTT for them.

Usefulness, social presence and legitimacy of the tool, as well as enjoyment and motivation, contribute to a favorable attitude toward using this tool in a learning environment. However, perceived ease of use was not found to be a significant determinant in the adoption and utilization of ChatGPT by the students.\n\n\nPractical implications\nThis research is intended to benefit enterprises, academic institutions and the global community by offering light on how students perceive the ChatGPT service in an educational setting. Furthermore, the application enhances confidence and interest among learners, leading to improved literacy and general awareness. Eventually, the outcome of this research will help AI developers to improve their product and service delivery, as well as benefit regulators in regulating the usage of AI-based bots.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nDue to its novelty, the current research on AI-based ChatGPT usage in the education sector is rather restricted. This study provides the adoption aspects of ChatGPT, a new AI-based technology for students, thereby contributing significantly to the existing research on the adoption of advanced education technologies.

Data from the 2021 Adolescent Behaviors and Experiences Survey (ABES) indicate that 37.1% of U.S. high school students reported poor mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, with 19.9% considering and 9.0% attempting suicide in the preceding year (1).

Also included are aspects of a child's environment that can undermine their sense of safety, stability, and bonding. Associations between ACEs occurring during the pandemic and mental health or suicidal behaviors among U.S. high school students were examined using ABES data.

Nonetheless, we lack a coherent understanding of the neuronal mechanisms through which ACEs impact gene expression and, thereby, the development of psychopathology. Methods: This observational pilot study used a novel marker of neuronal functioning (brain-derived micro ribonucleic acids, or miRNAs) collected via saliva to explore the connection between ACEs and neuronal gene expression in 45 adolescents with a collectively high ACE exposure (26 males and 19 females of diverse races/ethnicities, with six cumulative ACEs on average). We aimed to determine the feasibility of using salivary microRNA for probing neuronal gene expression with the goal of identifying cellular processes and genetic pathways perturbed by childhood adversity.

Findings suggest that although some believe AI may eventually replace teachers, the majority of participants argue that human teachers possess unique qualities, such as critical thinking, creativity, and emotions, which make them irreplaceable. The study also emphasizes the importance of social-emotional competencies developed through human interactions, which AI technologies cannot currently replicate. The research proposes that teachers can effectively integrate AI to enhance teaching and learning without viewing it as a replacement. To do so, teachers need to understand how AI can work well with teachers and students while avoiding potential pitfalls, develop AI literacy, and address practical issues such as data protection, ethics, and privacy. The study reveals that students value and respect human teachers, even as AI becomes more prevalent in education. The study also introduces a roadmap for students, teachers, and universities.

The findings show that educational information systems significantly enhance learning accessibility by providing flexible access to resources, facilitating real-time feedback, and supporting personalized learning paths. These systems also improve student engagement by enabling convenient access to materials and fostering a collaborative learning environment that accommodates different learning styles. However, the study identifies several barriers, including gaps in digital literacy, usability challenges, and unequal access to the necessary infrastructure, which can limit the effectiveness of these systems in reaching all students equally. Additionally, concerns around data privacy and system complexity are noted as areas needing attention to build user trust and ensure smoother system integration. The study concludes that while educational information systems hold great promise for improving accessibility and inclusivity in higher education, addressing these barriers through targeted training, digital equity initiatives, and robust data protection policies is essential for maximizing their potential. These insights offer valuable guidance for educational institutions aiming to create more inclusive learning environments through strategic integration of educational information systems.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2024-11-27", "synthetic_support_claim": "Educational information systems significantly enhance learning accessibility by providing flexible access to resources and personalized learning paths.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Educational information systems lead to better academic performance and higher grades for all students universally."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "9db7ba7adfb703b403040f0e08b92a4e5a94db7d", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9db7ba7adfb703b403040f0e08b92a4e5a94db7d", "title": "Stakeholders' Emotional Perceptions of Online Education Courses Based on New Media Big Data and Strategies for Integrating and Using Course Resources", "abstract": "Online education is an important component of education reform and one of the important learning modes in today's society, which can achieve the goal of learning anytime, anywhere and for everyone.

Physicians and academicians frequently make customized education materials for their patients. An artificial intelligence (AI)-based writer can help them write an article. Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT) is a conversational language model developed by OpenAI (openai.com). The model can generate human-like responses. Objective: We aimed to evaluate the generated text from ChatGPT for its suitability in patients' education. Materials and Methods: We asked the ChatGPT to list common dermatological diseases. It provided a list of 14 diseases. We used the disease names to converse with the application with disease-specific input (e.g., write a patient education guide on acne). The text was copied for checking the number of words, readability, and text similarity by software. The text's accuracy was checked by a dermatologist following the structure of observed learning outcomes (SOLO) taxonomy. For the readability ease score, we compared the observed value with a score of 30. For the similarity index, we compared the observed value with 15% and tested it with a one-sample t-test. Results: The ChatGPT generated a paragraph of text of 377.43 \u00b1 60.85 words for a patient education guide on skin diseases. The average text reading ease score was 46.94 \u00b1 8.23 (P < 0.0001), and it indicates that this level of text can easily be understood by a high-school student to a newly joined college student.

In the greater Boston area, only two school districts \u2014 the Boston and neighboring Chelsea districts \u2014 sustained masking requirements through June 2022. The staggered lifting of masking requirements provided an opportunity to examine the effect of universal masking policies on the incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) in schools. Methods We used a difference-in-differences analysis for staggered policy implementation to compare the incidence of Covid-19 among students and staff in school districts in the greater Boston area that lifted masking requirements with the incidence in districts that sustained masking requirements during the 2021\u20132022 school year. Characteristics of the school districts were also compared. Results Before the statewide masking policy was rescinded, trends in the incidence of Covid-19 were similar across school districts. During the 15 weeks after the statewide masking policy was rescinded, the lifting of masking requirements was associated with an additional 44.9 cases per 1000 students and staff (95% confidence interval, 32.6 to 57.1), which corresponded to an estimated 11,901 cases and to 29.4% of the cases in all districts during that time. Districts that chose to sustain masking requirements longer tended to have school buildings that were older and in worse condition and to have more students per classroom than districts that chose to lift masking requirements earlier. In addition, these districts had higher percentages of low-income students, students with disabilities, and students who were English-language learners, as well as higher percentages of Black and Latinx students and staff. Our results support universal masking as an important strategy for reducing Covid-19 incidence in schools and loss of in-person school days. As such, we believe that universal masking may be especially useful for mitigating effects of structural racism in schools, including potential deepening of educational inequities.

The study builds upon other previous studies on the topic of artificial intelligence (AI) tools. However, it is unique in terms of its context and the focus on integrity.\n\n\n\nA questionnaire was used to collect data from 383 finalist student teachers, and other 30 students were involved in focus group discussions (FGDs). Data for this study were analysed using IBM-SPSS Statistics Versions 25 to obtain descriptive statistics for the quantitative part and thematic analysis was used along with QDA Miner Lite for the qualitative part to generate themes.\n\n\n\nStudent teachers consider ChatGPT as a transformative AI technology to ease the accomplishment of their assessment tasks. However, a large percentage of them did not pay much attention to academic integrity while using the AI tool. About 199 (52%) out of 383 respondents said ChatGPT is a useful tool in generating answers for their assessment tasks compared to 192 (50.1%) of respondents who had negative opinions.\n\n\n\nGiven the sensitivity of the topic on academic integrity some participants were hesitant to share information until when the researchers clarified the purpose of the study. Participants were told that the information they would provide was purely for academic purpose. Also, this study was conducted when students\u2019 regular classes were in progress, such that it was challenging to set universal time to conduct FGDs where all intended participants could attend. The researcher was flexible enough to find hours which were conducive for participants to participate in FGDs.\n\n\n\nFor practitioners, given the fact that ChatGPT is a relatively new AI tool, training for raising awareness of its use should be conducted. Besides, specific academic integrity guidelines for its ethical use should be formulated and implemented. Likewise, instructors should set questions that prompt students original thinking which the AI tool cannot easily give contextualized solutions.\n\n\n\nThe university where the AI tool is used is an open system that is within the society, and the impacts of AI technologies are inevitable in social domains. The society, therefore, should be informed about the emerging AI tools with their associated potentials and shortcomings to safeguard the norms and interests of the society.\n\n\n\nThe study provides a comprehensive overview of student teachers\u2019 ChatGPT use and its implication on academic integrity.

This study integrates three models into one integrated model: TAM, UTAUT, and SCT. These three models are combined to understand how GenAI self-efficacy, perceived ethics, academic integrity, social influence, facilitating conditions, perceived risks, ease of use, and perceived usefulness influenced the participants\u2019 intention to adopt GenAI in research. Following this, data were collected from Egyptian academics linked to Egyptian universities. There were 742 responses to this question. Data were analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM). The paper's results showed that GenAI self-efficacy, social influence, and perceived ethics are significantly related to perceptions of ease of use, usefulness, and intention to use GenAI. Facilitating conditions have a negative effect on perceived ease of use, and perceived risk does not affect perceived usefulness or intention to use significantly. Notably, the result found that ethics and academic integrity affect perceptions of GenAI's usage and utility. This guide illustrates how universities must take proactive steps to influence how AI will be used and reinforces the importance of using these tools within an ethical lens.

The article analyzes the pros and cons of AI in HE, based on the views of eighteen academics from five Romanian universities. There is a large and heated debate about the proliferation of AI in many domains, with strong supporters and determined deniers. Studies that research the implications of AI enrich the evidence-based literature on the advantages, disadvantages, threats, or opportunities that AI creates for us, for businesses, or for societies. Though many aspects are still less well known, attitudes toward AI are still under construction. HE is a domain where the implications of AI create passionate discussions. HE is, eventually, the sector that shapes the masterminds of societies\u2019 leaders. There is a quest to find the perspectives of those who will apply AI, who will work with or for AI, and those who are opposed to or in favor of implementing AI in HE. The conclusions revealed by this study are in line with similar studies that exist in the literature. The positive aspects of AI implementation in HE are related, in the view of academics, to gains in the learning\u2013teaching process, improvements in students skills and competences, better inclusion, and greater efficiency in administrative costs. Similarly, the negative aspects revealed by the research are linked to psychosocial effects, data security, ethical aspects, and unemployment threats. However, there are some aspects (mostly negative) related to implementing AI in HE that are less exposed by the interviewed academics, which are mostly related to the costs and efforts of implementing AI in HE. The possible explanation of this situation is related to the lack of strategic vision on what, in fact, the implementation of AI in HE means, what this process involves, and the fact that digitalization in Romanian universities (as well as in the Romanian economy) is in its infancy. The contribution of the results of this research is mainly empirical and practical.

This study aims to evaluate the performance of Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT), a generative AI-based application, on a wide range of assessments used in contemporary healthcare education and discusses the implications for undergraduate dental education.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nThis was an exploratory study investigating the accuracy of ChatGPT to attempt a range of recognised assessments in healthcare education curricula. A total of 50 independent items encompassing 50 different learning outcomes (n\u2009=\u200910 per item) were developed by the research team. These included 10 separate items based on each of the five commonly used question formats including multiple-choice questions (MCQs); short-answer questions (SAQs); short essay questions (SEQs); single true/false questions; and fill in the blanks items. Chat GPT was used to attempt each of these 50 questions. In addition, ChatGPT was used to generate reflective reports based on multisource feedback; research methodology; and critical appraisal of the literature.\n\n\nRESULTS\nChatGPT application provided accurate responses to majority of knowledge-based assessments based on MCQs, SAQs, SEQs, true/false and fill in the blanks items. However, it was only able to answer text-based questions and did not allow processing of questions based on images. Responses generated to written assignments were also satisfactory apart from those for critical appraisal of literature. Word count was the key limitation observed in outputs generated by the free version of ChatGPT.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nNotwithstanding their current limitations, generative AI-based applications have the potential to revolutionise virtual learning.

This study systematically evaluates the epistemic reasoning capabilities of modern LMs, including GPT-4, Claude-3, and Llama-3, using a new dataset, KaBLE, consisting of 13,000 questions across 13 tasks. Our results reveal key limitations. First, while LMs achieve 86% accuracy on factual scenarios, their performance drops significantly with false scenarios, particularly in belief-related tasks. Second, LMs struggle with recognizing and affirming personal beliefs, especially when those beliefs contradict factual data, which raises concerns for applications in healthcare and counseling, where engaging with a person's beliefs is critical. Third, we identify a salient bias in how LMs process first-person versus third-person beliefs, performing better on third-person tasks (80.7%) compared to first-person tasks (54.4%). Fourth, LMs lack a robust understanding of the factive nature of knowledge, namely, that knowledge inherently requires truth.

The ability of teachers to analyze and evaluate students\u2019 classroom behavior is becoming a crucial criterion for quality teaching. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based behavior recognition techniques can help evaluate students\u2019 attention and engagement during classroom sessions. With rapid digitalization, the global education system is adapting and exploring emerging technological innovations, such as AI, the Internet of Things, and big data analytics, to improve education systems. In educational institutions, modern classroom systems are supplemented with the latest technologies to make them more interactive, student centered, and customized. However, it is difficult for instructors to assess students\u2019 interest and attention levels even with these technologies. This study harnesses modern technology to introduce an intelligent real-time vision-based classroom to monitor students\u2019 emotions, attendance, and attention levels even when they have face masks on. We used a machine learning approach to train students\u2019 behavior recognition models, including identifying facial expressions, to identify students\u2019 attention/non-attention in a classroom. The attention/no-attention dataset is collected based on nine categories. The dataset is given the YOLOv5 pre-trained weights for training. For validation, the performance of various versions of the YOLOv5 model (v5m, v5n, v5l, v5s, and v5x) are compared based on different evaluation measures (precision, recall, mAP, and F1 score). Our results show that all models show promising performance with 76% average accuracy.

Traditional manual attendance systems are frequently inefficient and prone to errors, such as proxy attendance and missed entries, which may impact the accuracy of attendance records. To address these challenges, an automatic attendance system that uses camera-based facial recognition technology is proposed. The latest technology records accurate attendance by taking visuals of students as soon as the class starts and comparing them to an already-existing database. Face recognition happens through human detection. The concept used here is deep learning. For students, this automated solution streamlines attendance management by ensuring that records are accurate and up to date without the need for manual entry. The system efficiently keeps track of the presence of teachers, notifying the Head of Department (HOD) right away in the case of an excused absence, therefore preventing disruptions during scheduled lessons.

Nonetheless, there is a scarcity of studies examining their performance in medical examinations, especially those conducted in languages other than English, and in direct comparison with medical students. Analyzing the performance of LLMs in state medical examinations can provide insights into their capabilities and limitations and evaluate their potential role in medical education and examination preparation. Objective This study aimed to assess and compare the performance of 3 LLMs, GPT-4, Bing, and GPT-3.5-Turbo, in the German Medical State Examinations of 2022 and to evaluate their performance relative to that of medical students. Methods The LLMs were assessed on a total of 630 questions from the spring and fall German Medical State Examinations of 2022. The performance was evaluated with and without media-related questions. Statistical analyses included 1-way ANOVA and independent samples t tests for pairwise comparisons. The relative strength of the LLMs in comparison with that of the students was also evaluated. Results GPT-4 achieved the highest overall performance, correctly answering 88.1% of questions, closely followed by Bing (86.0%) and GPT-3.5-Turbo (65.7%). The students had an average correct answer rate of 74.6%. Both GPT-4 and Bing significantly outperformed the students in both examinations. When media questions were excluded, Bing achieved the highest performance of 90.7%, closely followed by GPT-4 (90.4%), while GPT-3.5-Turbo lagged (68.2%). There was a significant decline in the performance of GPT-4 and Bing in the fall 2022 examination, which was attributed to a higher proportion of media-related questions and a potential increase in question difficulty.

This study evaluated the efficacy of online case-based tutorials using a serious game tutorial [PlayMed\u2122 (PM)], as compared to a traditional slideshow tutorial (TT). Methods We performed a prospective, mixed-methods, randomised controlled trial on undergraduate medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic, from May 2020 to January 2021. Students were block randomised into the PM or TT groups. Tutors conducted online teaching on bronchiolitis and gastroenteritis cases using PM or TT to facilitate the presentation. Educational experience was assessed using a continuous interval scale (0\u2013100; with pre-defined categories) and free text responses. Immediate and long-term knowledge acquisition was assessed using 6 multiple-choice questions (MCQ) for each case (total of 12 MCQ). A modified intention-to-treat mixed methods and a sensitivity per-protocol analysis were performed to compare outcomes between PM and TT groups. Results In total, 80\u2009PM and 73 TT participants attended at least one tutorial. Sixty-five (81%) PM and 52 (71%) TT participants completed at least one survey and were included for analysis.

ChatGPT has been widely applied in general medical education and cardiology, but its application in pharmacy has been lacking. This study examined the accuracy of ChatGPT on the Taiwanese Pharmacist Licensing Examination and investigated its potential role in pharmacy education. Methods: ChatGPT was used on the first Taiwanese Pharmacist Licensing Examination in 2023 in Mandarin and English. The questions were entered manually one by one. Graphical questions, chemical formulae, and tables were excluded. Textual questions were scored according to the number of correct answers. Chart question scores were determined by multiplying the number and the correct rate of text questions. This study was conducted from March 5 to March 10, 2023, by using ChatGPT 3.5. Results: The correct rate of ChatGPT in Chinese and English questions was 54.4% and 56.9% in the first stage, and 53.8% and 67.6% in the second stage. On the Chinese test, only pharmacology and pharmacochemistry sections received passing scores. The English test scores were higher than the Chinese test scores across all subjects and were significantly higher in dispensing pharmacy and clinical pharmacy as well as therapeutics. Conclusion: ChatGPT 3.5 failed the Taiwanese Pharmacist Licensing Examination. Although it is not able to pass the examination, it can be improved quickly through deep learning. It reminds us that we should not only use multiple-choice questions to assess a pharmacist\u2019s ability, but also use more variety of evaluations in the future.

The purpose of this study was to quantitatively evaluate and comprehensively analyze ChatGPT\u2019s performance in handling questions for the National Nursing Licensure Examination (NNLE) in China and the United States, including the National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses (NCLEX-RN) and the NNLE. Objective This study aims to examine how well LLMs respond to the NCLEX-RN and the NNLE multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in various language inputs. To evaluate whether LLMs can be used as multilingual learning assistance for nursing, and to assess whether they possess a repository of professional knowledge applicable to clinical nursing practice. Methods First, we compiled 150 NCLEX-RN Practical MCQs, 240 NNLE Theoretical MCQs, and 240 NNLE Practical MCQs. Then, the translation function of ChatGPT 3.5 was used to translate NCLEX-RN questions from English to Chinese and NNLE questions from Chinese to English. Finally, the original version and the translated version of the MCQs were inputted into ChatGPT 4.0, ChatGPT 3.5, and Google Bard. Different LLMs were compared according to the accuracy rate, and the differences between different language inputs were compared. Results The accuracy rates of ChatGPT 4.0 for NCLEX-RN practical questions and Chinese-translated NCLEX-RN practical questions were 88.7% (133/150) and 79.3% (119/150), respectively. Despite the statistical significance of the difference (P=.03), the correct rate was generally satisfactory. Around 71.9% (169/235) of NNLE Theoretical MCQs and 69.1% (161/233) of NNLE Practical MCQs were correctly answered by ChatGPT 4.0. The accuracy of ChatGPT 4.0 in processing NNLE Theoretical MCQs and NNLE Practical MCQs translated into English was 71.5% (168/235; P=.92) and 67.8% (158/233; P=.77), respectively, and there was no statistically significant difference between the results of text input in different languages. ChatGPT 3.5 (NCLEX-RN P=.003, NNLE Theoretical P<.001, NNLE Practical P=.12) and Google Bard (NCLEX-RN P<.001, NNLE Theoretical P<.001, NNLE Practical P<.001) had lower accuracy rates for nursing-related MCQs than ChatGPT 4.0 in English input. English accuracy was higher when compared with ChatGPT 3.5\u2019s Chinese input, and the difference was statistically significant (NCLEX-RN P=.02, NNLE Practical P=.02). Whether submitted in Chinese or English, the MCQs from the NCLEX-RN and NNLE demonstrated that ChatGPT 4.0 had the highest number of unique correct responses and the lowest number of unique incorrect responses among the 3 LLMs. Conclusions This study, focusing on 618 nursing MCQs including NCLEX-RN and NNLE exams, found that ChatGPT 4.0 outperformed ChatGPT 3.5 and Google Bard in accuracy.

We also assessed whether these self-reports of cheating increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, along with an evaluation of the quality of the research evidence which addressed these questions. 25 samples were identified from 19 Studies, including 4672 participants, going back to 2012. Online exam cheating was self-reported by a substantial minority (44.7%) of students in total. Pre-COVID this was 29.9%, but during COVID cheating jumped to 54.7%, although these samples were more heterogenous. Individual cheating was more common than group cheating, and the most common reason students reported for cheating was simply that there was an opportunity to do so. Remote proctoring appeared to reduce the occurrence of cheating, although data were limited. However there were a number of methodological features which reduce confidence in the accuracy of all these findings. Most samples were collected using designs which makes it likely that online exam cheating is under-reported, for example using convenience sampling, a modest sample size and insufficient information to calculate response rate. No studies considered whether samples were representative of their population.

Additionally, in order to study student engagement in more depth, it is crucial to focus factors that influence student engagement. In this paper, 30 articles from three databases, Google Scholar, Taylor & Francis Online, and SAGE, were screened for data analysis based on the inclusion criteria.

But where and with whom is this social-belonging intervention effective? Here we report a team-science randomized controlled experiment with 26,911 students at 22 diverse institutions. Results showed that the social-belonging intervention, administered online before college (in under 30 minutes), increased the rate at which students completed the first year as full-time students, especially among students in groups that had historically progressed at lower rates.

It also shows that a low-cost, scalable intervention generalizes its effects to 749 4-year institutions in the United States. Description Editor\u2019s summary The rate of earning university degrees in the United States is very unequal across social class, race, and ethnicity. Interventions that promote academic persistence also work differently for students from different backgrounds and operate differently across contexts. Walton et al. conducted a randomized controlled trial to systematically explain and understand these heterogenous effects in a brief online intervention across 22 universities and colleges (see the Perspective by Bowman). The intervention was designed to remedy students\u2019 concerns about belonging through a reading-and-writing activity that emphasized how worries about fitting in, struggling in class, and feeling homesick during the college transition are common and improve over time. They found that the intervention improved retention and persistence in school, particularly among historically underrepresented students, when the school context offered students opportunities to belong.

This paper reviews the relevant literature regarding risk factors and digital interventions for anxiety disorders among college students from the perspectives of different stakeholders. Risk factors at the national and societal levels include class differences and the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. College-level risk factors include the indoor environment design of the college environment, peer relationships, student satisfaction with college culture, and school functional levels. Family-level risk factors include parenting style, family relationship, and parental level of education. Individual-level risk factors include biological factors, lifestyle, and personality. Among the intervention options for college students' anxiety disorders, in addition to traditional cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based interventions, psychological counseling, and group counseling, digital mental health interventions are increasingly popular due to their low cost, positive effect, and convenient diagnostics and treatment. To better apply digital intervention to the prevention and treatment of college students' anxiety, this paper suggests that the different stakeholders form a synergy among themselves. The nation and society should provide necessary policy guarantees, financial support, and moral and ethical supervision for the prevention and treatment of college students' anxiety disorders. Colleges should actively participate in the screening and intervention of college students' anxiety disorders. Families should increase their awareness of college students' anxiety disorders and take the initiative to study and understand various digital intervention methods. College students with anxiety disorders should actively seek psychological assistance and actively accept and participate in digital intervention projects and services.

Understanding medical students\u2019 perceptions of ChatGPT is crucial for optimising its use in educational settings. Objectives To evaluate how medical students perceive ChatGPT for educational purposes and to assess its perceived advantages and disadvantages. Methods A cross-sectional study was carried out using a questionnaire with five main domains to explore Jordanian medical students\u2019 perceptions, practices, and concerns regarding the ChatGPT. This study was conducted from May to July, 2023, and the data were collected using the convenience sampling technique through Google Forms shared within medical students\u2019 Facebook groups. Descriptive statistics summarised participant demographics, while logistic regression identified factors influencing ChatGPT usage. Variables with a P-value\u2009\u2264\u20090.05 in multiple regression were considered statistically significant.

Therefore, we propose a lightweight object counting method named EdgeCount to effectively balance inference speed and object counting accuracy. Specifically, we construct a network composed of a student model (EdgeCount) and a teacher model (EdgeCount-T) with the same encoder-decoder structure based on density map knowledge distillation (DMKD), allowing the EdgeCount to learn object density distribution from the EdgeCount-T. After that, we introduce spatial and channel reconstruction convolution (SCConv), composed of a spatial reconstruction unit (SRU) and a channel reconstruction unit (CRU), to decrease spatial and channel redundancy with lower computational costs. Moreover, a low parameter weighted multi-scale feature fusion module (LWMFFM) is designed to further improve the countering ability through segmenting minor structural discrepacies among multi-scale features. Extensive experiments conducted on challenging remote sensing and dense crowd object counting datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.

Especially in intelligent education, which has become increasingly popular recent decades, cognitive diagnosis serves as a fundamental module for discovering the proficiency level of students on specific knowledge concepts. Existing approaches usually mine linear interactions of student exercising process by manually designed function (e.g., logistic function). However, the cognitive interactions between students and exercises is a complex process, and excessive simplifications would lead to under fitting and thus get inaccurate diagnostic results. Besides, the manually designed interaction functions are relatively inflexible and limits their extensibility. This consequently causes lack of consideration about useful non-numerical information in the cognitive process besides response logs. In this article, we propose a general Neural Cognitive Diagnosis (NeuralCD) framework as well as several implemented models (a basic implementation NeuralCDM and three extensions), where we project students and exercises to factor vectors and incorporates neural networks to learn the complex exercising interactions. To ensure the interpretability of diagnostic results, which is essential for cognitive diagnosis, we apply an monotonicity assumption to our NeuralCD framework. Moreover, NeuralCD is a general framework and has good extensibility. We show the generality of NeuralCD through proving how it can cover some traditional models. Then, we demonstrate the extensibility of NeuralCD, which benefits future developments. On one hand, we demonstrate content-based extensions where we provide examples of exploring the rich contents of exercise texts (CNCD-Q and CNCD-F). On the other hand, we demonstrate a knowledge-association based extension to show that NeuralCD is flexible for structural adjustments so as to solve specific problems.

This issue occurs because CAT systems do not effectively utilize the abundant prior information about the examinee available from other courses on online platforms. These response records, due to the commonality of cognitive states across different knowledge domains, can provide valuable prior information for the target domain. However, no prior work has explored solutions for the CSIP task. In response to this gap, we propose Diffusion Cognitive States TransfeR Framework (DCSR), a novel domain transfer framework based on Diffusion Models (DMs) to address the CSIP task. Specifically, we construct a cognitive state transition bridge between domains, guided by the common cognitive states of examinees, encouraging the model to reconstruct the initial ability state in the target domain. To enrich the expressive power of the generated data, we analyze the causal relationships in the generation process from a causal perspective. Redundant and extraneous cognitive states can lead to limited transfer and negative transfer effects.

Moreover, to address the discrepancy between the language space and the cognitive diagnosis space, we propose language-cognitive mappers in LRCD to learn the mapping from the former to the latter. Then, these profiles can be easily and efficiently integrated and trained with existing CDMs. Extensive experiments show that training LRCD on real-world datasets can achieve commendable zero-shot performance across different target domains, and in some cases, it can even achieve competitive performance with some classic CDMs trained on the full response data on target domains.

Towards this dilemma, in this paper, we explore a stronger logit distillation method via making better utilization of logit outputs.

Through this framework, the prediction alignment is not only conducted at the instance level, but also at the batch and class level, through which the student model learns instance prediction, input correlation, and category correlation simultaneously. In addition, a prediction augmentation mechanism based on model calibration further boosts the performance.

In contrast, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) benefit from hardware-compatible acceleration libraries, making them more suitable for real-time processing on resource-constrained IoT devices. To achieve high performance while meeting these real-time requirements, a promising approach is to apply knowledge distillation from a ViT teacher to a CNN student. However, existing knowledge distillation methods are typically designed for homogeneous teacher-student pairs, such as CNN-to-CNN transfers, and prove ineffective when applied to cross-architecture networks. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method called cross-architecture heterogeneous knowledge distillation (HTKD). Specifically, we introduce learnable queries to interact with extracted features through a cross-attention mechanism, mapping the disparate features across heterogeneous networks into a shared feature space.

From a neurodiversity perspective, these differences in the way people perceive, learn about and interact with the world are conceptualised as naturally occurring cognitive variation, akin to biodiversity in the natural environment, which may bring unique strengths and challenges for individuals. An implication of this approach is that interventions designed to create contexts in which neurodivergent people can thrive are needed, in addition to those that seek to ameliorate individual-level difficulties. In this conceptual review, we consider how higher education can offer a context in which cognitive diversity can be noticed, welcomed and accepted with warmth. In universities, neurodiversity is one dimension of difference within an increasingly diverse student population, which overlaps \u2013 but is not synonymous \u2013 with disability. We argue that improving experience and outcomes for neurodivergent students should be a priority for universities aiming to produce graduates equipped to tackle the complex problems of contemporary society. Drawing on the foundational principles of compassion-focused psychological therapies, we consider how compassion can be enacted within interpersonal interaction, curriculum design, and leadership culture in universities.

Appealing to Expert Judgement for Evaluating Human and AI Next-Step Hints for Novice Programmers", "abstract": "Motivation: Students learning to program often reach states where they are stuck and can make no forward progress. An automatically generated next-step hint can help them make forward progress and support their learning. It is important to know what makes a good hint or a bad hint, and how to generate good hints automatically in novice programming tools, for example using Large Language Models (LLMs). Method and participants: We recruited 44 Java educators from around the world to participate in an online study. We used a set of real student code states as hint-generation scenarios. Participants used a technique known as comparative judgement to rank a set of candidate next-step Java hints, which were generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) and by five human experienced educators. Participants ranked the hints without being told how they were generated. Findings: We found that LLMs had considerable variation in generating high quality next-step hints for programming novices, with GPT-4 outperforming other models tested. When used with a well-designed prompt, GPT-4 outperformed human experts in generating pedagogically valuable hints. A multi-stage prompt was the most effective LLM prompt. We found that the two most important factors of a good hint were length (80--160 words being best), and reading level (US grade 9 or below being best). Offering alternative approaches to solving the problem was considered bad, and we found no effect of sentiment. Conclusions: Automatic generation of these hints is immediately viable, given that LLMs outperformed humans -- even when the students' task is unknown. The fact that only the best prompts achieve this outcome suggests that students on their own are unlikely to be able to produce the same benefit. The prompting task, therefore, should be embedded in an expert-designed tool.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-11-27", "synthetic_support_claim": "GPT-4 outperformed human experts in generating pedagogically valuable next-step hints for programming novices.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "LLMs will consistently generate better next-step programming hints than human educators in all cases."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "2f5a7e6cb437e8e27546ee92027230aa525beee1", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2f5a7e6cb437e8e27546ee92027230aa525beee1", "title": "In-IDE Programming Courses: Learning Software Development in a Real-World Setting", "abstract": "While learning programming languages is crucial for software engineers, mastering the necessary tools is equally important.

Virtual reality (VR) technology offers innovative training solutions to enhance nurses\u2019 clinical skills and preparedness. However, extensive studies on its effectiveness in isolation ward environments are still limited. Objective This study aims to develop a nonimmersive VR (NIVR) simulation training program for isolation wards and further validate its feasibility and training effectiveness in aiding nurses in adapting to isolation ward settings. Methods This study was a prospective, parallel, open-label, randomized controlled trial. A total of 90 nurses from 3 hospitals in China were randomly assigned to either the control or intervention group, with 45 (50%) individuals in each group. Both groups received training on isolation ward layout and nursing procedures. The control group underwent a 4-hour conventional training session consisting of 2 hours of face-to-face lectures and 2 hours of ward visits. The intervention group received a 4-hour NIVR simulation training session. Subsequently, both groups completed approximately 4 hours of emergency drills and assessments. Results After the intervention, there were no significant differences in theoretical test or performance assessment scores between the 2 groups (t88=\u20130.30, P=.75; Cohen d=\u20130.06; z score=0.00, P>.99), using a 2-tailed t test. However, the intervention group completed 6 tasks faster than the control group (t88=5.10, P<.001; Cohen d=1.08), with an average reduction of about 3 minutes (control group: mean 43.91, SD 2.99 min; intervention group: mean 40.77, SD 2.85 min). Notably, they completed task 3 (patient reception inward) and task 6 (exiting the isolation area) significantly quicker (t88=3.22, P=.002; Cohen d=0.68; t88=3.03, P=.003; Cohen d=0.64, respectively), with no significant differences for the other tasks. Conclusions This study highlights the potential of NIVR simulation training for nurses working in isolation wards. Although NIVR simulation training does not significantly surpass traditional methods in imparting theoretical knowledge, it does reduce task completion time for specific activities. Its capacity for safe, repetitive practice and realistic scenario simulation makes NIVR a valuable tool in medical education. Further research and optimization of VR simulation training programs are recommended to enhance nurses\u2019 practical skills and pandemic preparedness.

Contemporary technologies involving AI are opening a wide spectrum of possibilities for enhancing creativity and sustainability within the creation of performance artworks, which is traditionally seen as an individual process of a human creator. The main research question within this study is as follows: How can performance and workshop creation through collaboration between humans and AI and humans and technology be understood as post-humanist artistic research? The sub-question is: How is such a creation process different from artistic creation using traditional tools associated with artistic work? These questions are answered by investigating a case of Techno-Lab in Sapmi and a performance artwork creation process through the method of post-humanist artistic research. The key findings outline the main differences of post-humanist vs. anthropocentric artistic research and art production.

Our analysis is framed within pedagogical theories, including social constructivism and competency-based learning, highlighting the importance of balancing human expertise and AI capabilities. We also address broader ethical concerns associated with GenAI, such as the risks of bias, the digital divide, and the environmental impact of AI technologies. This paper argues that while GenAI can provide substantial benefits in terms of automation and efficiency, its integration must be managed with care to avoid undermining the authenticity of student work and exacerbating existing inequalities. Finally, we propose a set of recommendations for educational institutions, including developing GenAI literacy programmes, revising assessment designs to incorporate critical thinking and creativity, and establishing transparent policies that ensure fairness and accountability in GenAI use. By fostering a responsible approach to GenAI, higher education can harness its potential while safeguarding the core values of academic integrity and inclusive education.", "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-01-09", "synthetic_support_claim": "GenAI's integration into education necessitates robust ethical frameworks to maintain academic integrity and equity.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "GenAI will completely replace human educators in higher education."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "4360bb29cfb6e41f5338576f550a71b28531cb77", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4360bb29cfb6e41f5338576f550a71b28531cb77", "title": "Pentingnya Evaluasi dalam Proses Pembelajaran dan Akibat Memanipulasinya", "abstract": "Evaluation is an important activity carried out by educators in the learning process.

Several fuzzy extensions of formal concept analysis have a great potential to visualize and evaluate students\u2019 solutions, to categorize the solutions into overlapping biclusters (formal concepts) or to generate the attribute implications between extracted attributes. Research Question: Does formal concept analysis describe the various solutions and the relationships between the extracted attributes of students\u2019 solutions in the educational and computational thinking game Light-Bot? Methodology: Targeting the evaluation of 64 students\u2019 solutions in the Light-Bot game, we construct the formal contexts of the extracted attributes. We apply formal concept analysis to construct the concept lattices from two binary formal contexts and to generate attribute implications and their fuzzy counterparts to find the dependencies between the extracted attributes. Findings: The results of our paper provide a description of various students\u2019 solutions which are visualized in the concept lattices. 1) Regarding the concept lattice of binary formal contexts, we obtained the characterization of the largest biclusters which includes a description of the largest group of similar solutions. 2) The attribute implications mainly reveal the characterization of similar solutions, e.g., with a higher count of executed commands in solutions. 3) Using fuzzy attribute implications, we obtained the characterization of solutions with unnecessary commands, going out of the game area, or using indirect recursion.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-01", "synthetic_support_claim": "Using fuzzy attribute implications, we obtained the characterization of solutions with unnecessary commands.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Formal concept analysis can improve overall student performance in computational thinking beyond solution categorization."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "a32db995c65f3e547cdb4ed86c82ead88a7acf47", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a32db995c65f3e547cdb4ed86c82ead88a7acf47", "title": "Leading Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) in Education: Bibliometric and Content Analysis From the Web of Science (2018\u20132022)", "abstract": "Emerging virtual reality and augmented reality (VR/AR) technologies in education have the potential to revolutionize the whole educational experience.

This Joanna Brings Institute (JBI) approach was used to investigate hazard recognition and prevention with AR and VR interventions. A total of six reliable databases were included: Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, PubMed, Scopus, and APA PsycNet, focusing on records and publications from the last five years. The review identified 5438 publications, with 22 meeting final inclusion criteria. The major findings include the use of AR and VR for teaching new skills, ensuring health and safety, enhancing realism, developing cognitive skills, improving performance, increasing engagement, and stimulating a sense of presence. Limitations identified include limited or non-diverse sample size, absence of real-world scenarios or contextual learning, inadequate game mechanics, insufficient validation of test results, lack of dynamic game behaviour, insufficient expert inclusion, technology issues, long-term impact assessment, and cost comparisons with traditional approaches. Technological issues have emerged as an additional impediment, limiting the efficacy of AR/VR applications in hazard recognition and prevention.

Although the world moves at different speeds and any generalization is bound to have some exceptions, there is evidence from research conducted in different places and contexts that educational methods are becoming increasingly digitized and driven by technological innovation. Among the technological trends fueled in many cases by the COVID-19 pandemic and the need to stay at home but online, augmented reality solutions received an additional boost as a valid and versatile educational technology worth exploring and eventually integrating into several teaching methods already in use. Although the technology still faces problems related to affordability, accessibility, and the technical skills required of users, some ongoing projects have already provided evidence that using augmented reality solutions as teaching and learning tools can improve teacher and student learning outcomes by increasing engagement and interactivity. The same issues arose when personal computers, tablets, and smartphones were first discussed as valuable tools for education and have now found their way into most classrooms. This paper reviews some of the key concepts related to augmented reality, as well as some current trends, benefits, and concerns related to its integration into educational contexts in areas such as life sciences, engineering, and health.

AR technology is developing rapidly, supporting medical education by presenting models of human anatomy as digital objects overlaid in the real world via mobile or head-mounted display (HMD). The purpose of this systematic review is to provide a post-pandemic analysis of AR compared with other methods for teaching anatomy and to determine the effects of AR on learning outcomes (LOs). Original research published between January 2020 and April 2024 was obtained from the WOS, Scopus, MEDLINE(Ovid), EMBASE, and PubMed databases, following PRISMA 2020 protocols. Articles included for analysis compared AR with alternative pedagogical methods of teaching undergraduate human anatomy. Studies that described AR as \"mixed reality\" (MR) were included, while those describing \"virtual reality\" (VR) were not considered. Risk of bias and limitations in individual studies were assessed using the Quality Assessment with Diverse Studies (QuADS) tool. Data were synthesized using a convergent integrated approach with LOs tabulated for visual analysis. A total of 17 articles were eligible for review: nine studies comparing AR via HMD hardware, and eight comparing mobile AR. The LOs of 12 studies were overwhelmingly reported as non-significant. Insufficient data precluded an accurate meta-analysis of LOs, and critical analysis revealed a considerable risk of bias and lack of justified methodology. While AR holds potential for supporting undergraduate students in learning anatomy, definitive outcomes from the current literature are limited by the heterogeneous nature of the studies and inconsistent use of terminology.

The participants were divided into two groups: a control group and an experimental group. The control group was taught using traditional teaching methods and the experimental group was taught using augmented reality. At the end of an 8-week product creativity design course, the course was evaluated using a course evaluation scale that has been used by the college for many years.

In this work, we first conduct a systematic analysis of the existing calibration methods, where we both provide a unified view and reveal the failure cases. Inspired by these analyses, we propose Batch Calibration (BC), a simple yet intuitive method that controls the contextual bias from the batched input, unifies various prior approaches, and effectively addresses the aforementioned issues. BC is zero-shot, inference-only, and incurs negligible additional costs. In the few-shot setup, we further extend BC to allow it to learn the contextual bias from labeled data.

Teachers did not achieve many digital competencies, resulting in an inability to facilitate the students' learning by using technology creatively to overcome challenges. Accordingly, developing teachers' digital competencies to facilitate the teaching and learning process will: positively impact students' innovative use of digital technology in completing their tasks;consequently, develop their digital competencies;prepare them for jobs that do not yet exist;and support them for unexpected challenges they might face.This study investigates the impact of the upskilling training programme on developing teachers' digital competence, where the aim is to investigate if the teachers' digital competence has improved from the expected intermediate level stated by the World Bank Report in 2021, where strategies for the Digital Skills Action Plan were mentioned. For instance, strategy 2 \"Reform of Digital Skills programmes\u201d stated that students must acquire at least intermediate level of general digital skills. Strategy 3 \"Enhance use of technologies in teaching and learning\u201d aims to advance teachers' digital competencies to be above the intermediate level. Accordingly, the above average level was used in the hypothesis as a benchmark of the teachers' levels after attending the upskilling training programme. The upskilling training programme of this study is a 10\u2010week training session using blended learning approach with instructor leading. The training's long\u2010term goals aim to construct a higher level of competency in a set of skills, attitudes as well as knowledge, which include digital citizenship;communication and collaboration;critical thinking, problem\u2010solving, and decision\u2010making;creativity and innovation;using technology as a tool.A sequential mixed\u2010method approach using quantitative and qualitative data was used. An online survey with closed\u2010ended items was adopted to collect quantitative data from teachers. The qualitative data was collected through teachers' focus group discussions using the Zoom conference meetings platform. The participants are K\u201012 teachers from a group of national charity schools in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).The study results revealed that the upskilling training programme efficiently developed teachers' digital competence where they construct knowledge and skills. Teachers exhibit a positive attitude towards using technology that supports collaboration, learning, and productivity, consequently developing their digital competence. As a result, this will also lead to the development of the students' digital competencies, where they will be able to overcome challenges they might face in this changing world, especially after the pandemic of Covid\u201019, where there is reliance on the use of technology.These findings aid in understanding the impact of the upskilling training programme on the development of the teachers' digital competence. Educators need to provide teachers with suitable online and face\u2010to\u2010face training that meets the teachers' needs. However, understanding the difference between upskilling and reskilling training programmes is vital to delivering training that develops the teachers' capabilities.

Technology has become an integral part of the recent teaching\u2013learning setup and it can significantly impact student satisfaction. Additionally, student engagement is vital for sustainable student satisfaction. Engaged students are more likely to take an active role in their education, participate in discussions, and ask questions. When students are engaged, they feel a sense of ownership over their learning experience, which can lead to higher levels of satisfaction. Therefore, educational institutions should strive to provide students with technology that is intuitive and easy to use and create an environment that fosters engagement and collaboration. By doing so, institutions can increase student satisfaction and improve overall academic outcomes. This research study was primarily conducted to understand the potential of the technology interface (TI) and student engagement (SE) in enhancing student satisfaction (SS). The study uses a survey to collect responses from 400 respondents from higher educational institutions (HEIs). PLS-SEM has been used to test the proposed hypothesis. Three dimensions of the technology interface (TI) include cyber infrastructure, quality of e-content, and technology-assisted facilities. It is essential to understand how the technology interface influences student engagement (SE) through three dimensions, viz. new skills development, active involvement, and academic achievements. The student satisfaction scale has an employability perspective, teaching perspective, and learning perspective as subscales. Initially, the study examines the influence of the technology interface on student engagement. The findings support a positive impact on student engagement. The next step was to study the direct effect of the technology interface on student satisfaction. The results lend support to a positive influence. An attempt was also made to investigate the mediation of student engagement between the technology interface and student satisfaction. The findings highlight that with the mediation of student engagement, the influence of the technology interface on student satisfaction is improved. This study is one of the pioneering empirical studies highlighting the importance of the technology interface on the mediation of student engagement in student satisfaction. Technology may be a prerequisite, but it needs to be translated to student satisfaction by using it with student engagement (new skills development, active involvement, and academic achievements).

This research project investigates what are the major benefits and risks of Chinese students using ChatGPT for academic activities. Also, the project assesses how, if applicable, should ChatGPT be regulated in Chinese academic settings in order to maintain academic integrity and ethical standards. Methodology. The collection of primary data from relevant newspaper articles serves as the foundation of this research project. Here, the content analysis is used for primary data collection. A combination of keywords [\u201cChatGPT\u201d AND (\u201cChina\u201d OR \u201cChinese\u201d) AND (\u201cstudents\u201d OR \u201cstudent\u201d)] were typed on the Google news search engine on 12 April 2023. A sum of 40 newspaper articles were deemed eligible for data analysis. Both qualitative and quantitative data were extracted and analyzed. Findings. The opinion of using ChatGPT to fulfil academic responsibilities has been polarized in China. The conservative camps worry that students are using ChatGPT to commit academic cheating. However, some Chinese educators believe AI-powered technologies should be incorporated into academic learning as AI-enabled writing tools can help improve the quality of academic outputs. A major concern that Chinese educators hold, to date, is plagiarism violations by students as an act of academic cheating. Most newspaper articles presented the use of ChatGPT in Chinese academic settings neutrally. Newspaper articles published in March 2023 contained more positive and negative word(s) about the use of ChatGPT in academic learning. Conclusions. Given the benefits ChatGPT can provide and the near-infeasibility of massively ban the use of AI-powered software, more regulations should be set up in Chinese academia.

This policy change stems from the shift in educational priorities driven by globalization and the integration of international standards, which emphasize proficiency in globally dominant languages like English. This paper explored the perceptions of Filipino teachers about the removal of the Filipino subject from senior high school (SHS) curriculum. A total of 76 secondary-level Filipino teachers were purposively selected based on the results of a preliminary open-ended survey. This paper analyzed responses from one-on-one interviews, identifying themes that highlight the impact of the removal of the subject on language usability and relatability. The findings revealed that the proposed removal of the Filipino subject from the Philippine curriculum raised significant concerns about its implications for cultural identity, language preservation, and education. Filipino teachers expressed apprehension that the exclusion of the subject could lead to language shift, wherein students increasingly prioritized English as a marker of success and global competitiveness, relegating Filipino to informal and limited contexts. Teachers highlighted that Filipino language and literature were essential for preserving the nation\u2019s heritage, encouraging cultural pride, and maintaining linguistic diversity. Also, the removal of the subject could have accelerated language attrition, where students lost proficiency in Filipino, particularly in formal settings, further marginalizing its use. To address these challenges, it was essential for educators and administrators to implement strategies that promoted the use of the Filipino language across various academic contexts, ensured an effective integration of English proficiency and Filipino language preservation within the curriculum, and provided ongoing professional development for teachers.

In a very short time span, consumers and a wide range of organizations have adopted generative AI technologies with astonishing capabilities (Bove 2023). These new technological developments have accelerated the integration of AI into many tools, apps, and areas of our daily life, but the transformative AI technology is perhaps most deeply impacting the world of advertising. AI-enabled advertising spending worldwide in 2022 was estimated to be $370 billion, with predictions of $1.3 trillion in the next ten years (Statista 2023). While the viral sensation and enormous popularity of ChatGPT are generating unprecedented attention and interest in AI right now, AI, as both a theoretical concept and version of its technological implementations and applications, has a long history with its origin going back to the 1950s. In the advertising field, the first research article on the topic of AI in connection to advertising was published in 1988 (Cook and Schleede 1988). The authors described \u201cdecision support systems\u201d (i.e., expert systems) as probably the \u201cmost widely implemented and well-known applications of AI\u201d (48). As described, these systems used databases and models to solve problems, such as help with direct-mail systems and newspaper advertising placement. Since then, AI has changed the business of media and advertising and attracted attention from both advertising practitioners and scholars. Although there is no standard definition, Rodgers (2021) defined AI advertising as \u201cbrand communication that uses a range of machine functions that learn to carry out tasks with intent to persuade with input by humans, machines, or both\u201d (2) and positioned AI advertising as a subdiscipline of advertising \u201csituated at the intersection of cognitive science, computer science, and advertising\u201d (2). Advertisers are using AI technologies in automated market segmentation and targeting, ad creative development and personalization, improving ad buying and placement, and optimizing advertising investment (Kietzmann, Paschen, and Treen 2018). Following the trend of increasing AI adoption in advertising, advertising scholars have organized sessions at the American Academy of Advertising (AAA) conference, such as the 2014 preconference, \u201cBig Data for Advertising Research and Education,\u201d and the joint AAA-ANA Educational Foundation luncheon panel with the provocative title, \u201cThe Future of Advertising\u2014Will We Be Replaced by Robots?\u201d in 2018. The Journal of Advertising (JA) has published multiple themed collections on AI-related topics, starting with a Special Section on Artificial Intelligence and Advertising, guest-edited by Hairong Li (2019). This collection of articles explored the potential and actual application of AI technologies to enhance advertising efficiency, effects, and effectiveness across the entire spectrum of the advertising campaign process, from situation analysis and consumer insight generation to advertising message creation, to media planning and buying, and to advertising effect assessment (see the Journal of Advertising, vol. 48, no. 4). Another Special Section on Advances in Computational Advertising in 2020, guest edited by Jisu Huh and Ed Malthouse (2020), addressed broad implications of evolving computer science technologies for data-driven, AI-powered computational advertising, and proposed a future research agenda in the areas of macro and exogenous factors, consumers\u2019 roles in computational advertising, AI-powered ad content generation, computational advertising media planning strategy shifts from purchasing exposure to focusing on meaningful consumer engagement, and computational advertising measurement systems (see the Journal of Advertising, vol. 49, no. 4). A year later, JA published an up-to-date comprehensive Themed Issue on Promises and Perils of Artificial Intelligence and Advertising (2021, vol. 50, no. 1). In her editorial, the previous editor, Shelly Rodgers (2021) proposed an AI classification schema to systematically understand and develop subdomains", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-07-13", "synthetic_support_claim": "AI-enabled advertising spending worldwide is predicted to reach $1.3 trillion in the next ten years.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "AI advancements will entirely replace human roles in advertising within the next decade."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "33937ccda505d9d6bce2106f9cf98479a71824a3", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/33937ccda505d9d6bce2106f9cf98479a71824a3", "title": "Examining Ethical Applications of AI in Advertising and Marketing Industries*", "abstract": "Artificial intelligence infused into advertising has changed the nature of campaigns to increased efficiency and targets.

Moral education of youth is one of the key components in shaping values across various contexts. Among the many approaches to such education, a special role is assigned to sports and physical activity and their influence on personality development. The potential of sports to foster moral education underscores the need for effective approaches to teaching moral values through sport. The aim of the study is to compare the effectiveness of active discussion and passive observation approaches in developing moral competencies among amateur and professional sports students.\nMaterial and Methods. The study included 259 first-year sports students. Among them, 131 were professional athletes. In the pre-test phase, all participants completed Lind\u2019s Moral Judgment Test and the Moral Judgment Test in Physical Education. After a seven-week intervention, participants completed only the Moral Judgment Test in Physical Education as a post-test. The intervention involved three groups. Groups E1 and E2 viewed films that portrayed contrasting behaviors in sports. Group E3 participated in discussions based on the Konstanz Method of Dilemma-Discussion.\nResults. Significant differences (p = .01) in sport-related moral competence were observed in the post-test. Group E3, which participated in moral dilemma discussions, achieved the highest scores in sport-related moral competence. Among amateur athletes, the intervention significantly improved sport-related moral competencies from pre- to post-test.\nConclusion. The results show that engaging in discussions about moral dilemmas can shape young athletes' perceptions and judgments.

The primary goal of these initiatives was to enhance the academic performance of freshmen. In Method 300, for students to benefit from grade improvements, they must assist each other, regularly attend team meetings, and commit to the activities that constitute the method. The method was implemented only during the first half of the course, fortunately it also implicated into the second part of the course, showing that a tenth of the students who performed poorly at the beginning achieved satisfactory and excellent performance in the last assessment, even though the content was more complex. According to the assessment system of the whole course, by monitoring students who initially had poor academic performance, it was found that half of them achieved satisfactory performance by the end of the course, which contributed to a final approval rate above 73% of all students. The condition of student heterogeneity is crucial for the effective application of Method 300; without it, this could become a potential limitation to its successful implementation. In addition to this strategy, the course was supported by voluntary extracurricular tutors, although these were underutilized by the freshmen, prompting us to consider new ways of providing support.

Experience of chronic stress is a risk factor for poor mental and physical well-being, and burnout. There is limited knowledge regarding optimal interventions to address stress and burnout among teachers. Objective: To undertake a scoping review of the literature in the last five years to determine various psychological interventions to address stress and burnout among teachers. Method: The PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews was followed. Relevant search terms were used to determine different interventions adopted to reduce teachers\u2019 stress and burnout. Articles published between 2018 and 2022 were identified using five bibliographic databases. Relevant articles were extracted, reviewed, collated, and thematically analyzed, and findings s were summarized. Results: Forty studies conducted in Asia, North America, Oceania, Europe, and Africa, met the inclusion criteria. Sixteen kinds of burnout and stress-reduction interventions were identified. The most popularly studied intervention were Mindfulness-Based Interventions alone or in combination with yoga or Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), followed by Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy (REBT). Mindfulness-Based Interventions led to decreased overall Teacher Stress Inventory (TSI) and emotional exhaustion subscale scores. REBT, primarily used with special education teachers, especially in Africa, has also shown positive results. Other interventions reporting positive outcomes include Inquiry-Based Stress Reduction (IBSR), the Stress Management and Resiliency Training Program (SMART), Cyclic Meditation, Group Sandplay, Progressive Muscle Relaxation, Autogenic Training, Sport-Based Physical Activity, Emotional Intelligence Ability Models and Christian Prayer and Prayer-Reflection. Conclusions: Stress and burnout can have a negative impact on teachers and, very often, on the students they teach.

Despite the availability of various psychosocial interventions, comprehensive evidence of their effectiveness and implementation is limited for this occupational group, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This mixed methods study aims to conduct a scoping review of characteristics, effectiveness, and implementation outcomes of psychosocial interventions for teachers\u2019 mental health and mental problems, integrating these with teachers\u2019 lived experiences to inform the implementation of mental health interventions in LMICs. Methods The study combines a scoping review with insights from an advisory group of teaching professionals with relevant lived experiences (PWLEs). The review will focus on examining psychosocial interventions studies promoting mental health or addressing mental problems among grade 1\u201312 school teachers of all genders, ages and contexts, except those working in specialized settings, such as special education centers, or disaster- or crisis-stricken zones. Intervention studies exclusively focusing on physical health or job-related outcomes will be excluded. Using pre-defined search terms, quantitative and qualitative research studies, including unpublished literature, will be searched across multiple databases. Titles and abstracts of identified studies will be screened against inclusion criteria, and the potentially relevant sources will be retrieved in full. Data will be extracted using a data extraction sheet developed for the study covering variables related to participant characteristics, intervention characteristics, study context, effectiveness and implementation outcomes. A purposively selected sample of 10 PWLEs will form the study advisory group and participate in four online workshop-group discussions. The meetings will include a presentation of the scoping review findings, followed by discussions on the relevance of these intervention packages for LMICs, adaptations needed to make them acceptable among school teachers and feasible for delivery in low-resourced settings like India. The synthesis of the data will employ narrative and thematic approaches to generate actionable insights for implementing psychosocial interventions in LMICs. Discussion This study will provide comprehensive evidence on the characteristics and outcomes of psychosocial interventions for teachers\u2019 mental health and mental problems. By integrating insights from teachers with relevant lived experiences, the study will provide practical guidelines for adapting and implementing psychosocial interventions among school teachers in LMICs.

The most affected areas include organizations\u2019 process of leveraging high-tech medical equipment from abroad to facilitate a practical approach to learning. Also, as countries implemented COVID-19 safety regulations, it became difficult for organizations to conduct face-to-face training. Consequently, non-face-to-face learning methods have been introduced in the medical field to enable instructors to remotely engage with learners. The current research investigated the students' perceptions of the use of metaverse systems in medical training within the medical community of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). \nMethods: A conceptual model comprising the adoption properties of personal innovativeness, perceived enjoyment, and Technology Acceptance Model concepts was utilised. The current research targeted students in UAE medical universities.

In addition, the language used by students is different from the language in journals and Wikipedia, which are training sources of BERT and its existing variants. All these suggest that a domain-specific model pre-trained using science education data may improve model performance. However, the ideal type of data to contextualize pre-trained language model and improve the performance in automatically scoring student written responses remains unclear. Therefore, we employ different data in this study to contextualize both BERT and SciBERT models and compare their performance on automatic scoring of assessment tasks for scientific argumentation. We use three datasets to pre-train the model: 1) journal articles in science education, 2) a large dataset of students' written responses (sample size over 50,000), and 3) a small dataset of students' written responses of scientific argumentation tasks. Our experimental results show that in-domain training corpora constructed from science questions and responses improve language model performance on a wide variety of downstream tasks.

Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in addressing this issue, particularly in alphabetic languages like English. However, their applicability to logographic languages is less explored. This study investigates the potential of fine-tuning ChatGPT, a leading LLM, to automatically score scientific explanations written in Chinese. Student responses to seven scientific explanation tasks were collected and automatically scored, with scoring accuracy examined in relation to reasoning complexity using the Kendall correlation. A qualitative analysis explored how linguistic features influenced scoring accuracy. The results show that domain-specific adaptation enables ChatGPT to score Chinese scientific explanations with accuracy. However, scoring accuracy correlates with reasoning complexity: a negative correlation for lower-level responses and a positive one for higher-level responses. The model overrates complex reasoning in low-level responses with intricate sentence structures and underrates high-level responses using concise causal reasoning. These correlations stem from linguistic features--simplicity and clarity enhance accuracy for lower-level responses, while comprehensiveness improves accuracy for higher-level ones. Simpler, shorter responses tend to score more accurately at lower levels, whereas longer, information-rich responses yield better accuracy at higher levels.

For the use of ChatGPT in education, research and healthcare, different perspectives exist with some level of ambiguity around its acceptability and ideal uses. However, the literature is acutely lacking in establishing a link to assess the intellectual levels of ChatGPT in the medical sciences. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the knowledge level of ChatGPT in medical education both in basic and clinical medical sciences, multiple-choice question (MCQs) examination-based performance and its impact on the medical examination system. In this study, initially, a subject-wise question bank was established with a pool of multiple-choice questions (MCQs) from various medical textbooks and university examination pools. The research team members carefully reviewed the MCQ contents and ensured that the MCQs were relevant to the subject\u2019s contents. Each question was scenario-based with four sub-stems and had a single correct answer. In this study, 100 MCQs in various disciplines, including basic medical sciences (50 MCQs) and clinical medical sciences (50 MCQs), were randomly selected from the MCQ bank. The MCQs were manually entered one by one, and a fresh ChatGPT session was started for each entry to avoid memory retention bias. The task was given to ChatGPT to assess the response and knowledge level of ChatGPT. The first response obtained was taken as the final response. Based on a pre-determined answer key, scoring was made on a scale of 0 to 1, with zero representing incorrect and one representing the correct answer. The results revealed that out of 100 MCQs in various disciplines of basic and clinical medical sciences, ChatGPT attempted all the MCQs and obtained 37/50 (74%) marks in basic medical sciences and 35/50 (70%) marks in clinical medical sciences, with an overall score of 72/100 (72%) in both basic and clinical medical sciences.

Prior to the pandemic, depression and anxiety were already on the rise among college students, but the changes associated with it may have exacerbated these issues. Our study aimed to explore factors influencing college students\u2019 mental health and identify common trends in their experiences that could assist organizations and policymakers in the future. Methods The study participants (n = 571) were chosen using a convenience sample of undergraduate and graduate students attending a Central Texas university. We employed the Qualtrics survey platform to collect data on multiple demographic variables, behavioral health, and other health outcomes of students in the summer semester of 2021. Our objective in this study was to investigate the various factors that contribute to mental health conditions, particularly anxiety, and depression, independently and jointly, by employing two validated tools - Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), which measures depression, and General Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7), which measures anxiety. Results Both the tools displayed satisfactory internal consistency, with Cronbach\u2019s alpha coefficients (\u03b1) of 0.921 for the PHQ-9 (9-item) scale and 0.943 for the GAD-7 (7-item) scale. The prevalence of depression and anxiety among participants was 39.4% and 40.1%, respectively, with 31% of participants overall reporting both conditions. Among the explored factors, age, race, parent/guardian\u2019s level of education, campus residence status, and health insurance status were associated with depression (p < 0.05), whereas gender, age, race, and parent/guardian\u2019s level of education were associated with anxiety (p < 0.05). Academically, several factors related to learning difficulties (i.e., staying motivated to learn, finding a quiet place to learn) were associated with the severity of depression and anxiety severity, demonstrated through composite scores.

Recent studies have applied multiple types of deep neural networks to solve the KT problem. However, there are two important factors in real-world educational data that are not well represented. First, most existing works augment input representations with the co-occurrence matrix of questions and knowledge components1 (KCs) but fail to explicitly integrate such intrinsic relations into the final response prediction task. Second, the individualized historical performance of students has not been well captured. In this paper, we proposed AT-DKT to improve the prediction performance of the original deep knowledge tracing model with two auxiliary learning tasks, i.e., question tagging (QT) prediction task and individualized prior knowledge (IK) prediction task. Specifically, the QT task helps learn better question representations by predicting whether questions contain specific KCs. The IK task captures students\u2019 global historical performance by progressively predicting student-level prior knowledge that is hidden in students\u2019 historical learning interactions. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three real-world educational datasets and compare the proposed approach to both deep sequential KT models and non-sequential models. Experimental results show that AT-DKT outperforms all sequential models with more than 0.9% improvements of AUC for all datasets, and is almost the second best compared to non-sequential models.

In Brazil, literature teachers often complain about students' resistance to the content and insufficient reading practice. To address these challenges, this work presents a serious game in which students can chat with Machado de Assis, an important writer of the Brazilian literature. The game was developed by integrating with ChatGPT. The validation was conducted with 15 high school students for them to interpret the book \"Dom Casmurro\". The MEEGA+ instrument was used to evaluate the usability and the experience with the game. The main findings were that students better understood the book, found the game easy to use, and felt immersed in the conversation with Machado de Assis, although they assessed the texts as long and tiring. In a world dominated by faster and visually stimulating forms of entertainment, such as video games and social networks, students may have different expectations regarding the reading experience. If they are not used to reading denser and more introspective texts, they may find it difficult to maintain interest when chatting with Machado de Assis. Finally, another implicit point in the game dynamics is observed: the (re)signification of the methodology to be adopted by the teacher, who will perceive the need to complement interactions with the writer in class according to what he can or should answer, tending to responses that stimulate students to study more about what is within the realm of knowledge about Machado de Assis.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2024-10-07", "synthetic_support_claim": "Students better understood \"Dom Casmurro\" after using the serious game featuring Machado de Assis via ChatGPT.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Generative AI-driven serious games improve overall academic performance in literature classes significantly."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "28f451fdb4a766d4a7f6a93df84320a21112886e", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/28f451fdb4a766d4a7f6a93df84320a21112886e", "title": "Beyond borders or building new walls?", "abstract": "\n Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has been offering unprecedented opportunities for language education.\n However, its capacity to embrace linguistic diversity, particularly for learners of dialect-rich languages like Vietnamese and\n Mandarin, remains underexamined.

Describe the differences in the integration of the SDGs in higher education across high-income countries (HICs) and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Methods Following a scoping review methodology, we searched Medline, Web of Science, Global Health, and Educational Resources Information Center, as well as websites of key institutions including universities, identifying peer-reviewed articles and grey literature published between September 2015 and December 2021. Results We identified 20 articles and 38 grey literature sources. Since 2018, the number of publications about the topic has been increasing. The SDGs were most frequently included in bachelor-level education and disciplines such as engineering and technology; humanities and social sciences; business, administration, and economics. Methods of integrating the SDGs into higher education included workshops, courses, lectures, and other means. Workshops and courses were the most frequent. The methods of integration varied in high-income countries compared to low- and middle-income countries. High-income countries seemed to follow a more academic approach to the SDGs while low- and middle-income countries integrate the SDGs with the aim to solve real-world problems. Conclusion This study provides examples of progress in integrating the SDGs into higher education.

Clinical natural language processing applications must navigate complex language and ensure privacy compliance. Prompt engineering offers a novel approach by designing tailored prompts to guide models in exploiting clinically relevant information from complex medical texts. Despite its promise, the efficacy of prompt engineering in the medical domain remains to be fully explored. Objective The aim of the study is to review research efforts and technical approaches in prompt engineering for medical applications as well as provide an overview of opportunities and challenges for clinical practice. Methods Databases indexing the fields of medicine, computer science, and medical informatics were queried in order to identify relevant published papers. Since prompt engineering is an emerging field, preprint databases were also considered. Multiple data were extracted, such as the prompt paradigm, the involved LLMs, the languages of the study, the domain of the topic, the baselines, and several learning, design, and architecture strategies specific to prompt engineering. We include studies that apply prompt engineering\u2013based methods to the medical domain, published between 2022 and 2024, and covering multiple prompt paradigms such as prompt learning (PL), prompt tuning (PT), and prompt design (PD). Results We included 114 recent prompt engineering studies. Among the 3 prompt paradigms, we have observed that PD is the most prevalent (78 papers). In 12 papers, PD, PL, and PT terms were used interchangeably. While ChatGPT is the most commonly used LLM, we have identified 7 studies using this LLM on a sensitive clinical data set. Chain-of-thought, present in 17 studies, emerges as the most frequent PD technique. While PL and PT papers typically provide a baseline for evaluating prompt-based approaches, 61% (48/78) of the PD studies do not report any nonprompt-related baseline. Finally, we individually examine each of the key prompt engineering\u2013specific information reported across papers and find that many studies neglect to explicitly mention them, posing a challenge for advancing prompt engineering research.

It is also a significant tool for achieving success in life. One of the important aspects influencing any educational institution's success is its students' academic achievement. In educational institutions, student dropout is a complex problem. Educational managers consider it vital to predict a student's risk of dropping out as soon as possible. It still needs to be easier to predict accurately in advance. The major problems in the present research work include overfitting in a predictive model, complex variable relationships, insufficient feature extraction, and data pre-processing complexity. The key goal of this study is to improve student achievement, decrease the number of dropouts, create support plans, and constantly modify these plans based on ongoing progress monitoring. Specifically, this research aims to identify at-risk students early using machine learning algorithms, allowing educational institutions to take timely and targeted interventions.

However, to date, no study has comprehensively summarized the status and opinions of using ChatGPT across different nursing fields. Objective We aim to synthesize the status and opinions of using ChatGPT according to different nursing fields, as well as assess ChatGPT\u2019s strengths, weaknesses, and the potential impacts it may cause. Methods This scoping review was conducted following the framework of Arksey and O\u2019Malley and guided by the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews). A comprehensive literature research was conducted in 4 web-based databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and CINHAL) to identify studies reporting the opinions of using ChatGPT in nursing fields from 2022 to September 3, 2023. The references of the included studies were screened manually to further identify relevant studies. Two authors conducted studies screening, eligibility assessments, and data extraction independently. Results A total of 30 studies were included.

However, a large percentage of them did not pay much attention to academic integrity while using the AI tool. About 199 (52%) out of 383 respondents said ChatGPT is a useful tool in generating answers for their assessment tasks compared to 192 (50.1%) of respondents who had negative opinions.\n\n\n\nGiven the sensitivity of the topic on academic integrity some participants were hesitant to share information until when the researchers clarified the purpose of the study. Participants were told that the information they would provide was purely for academic purpose. Also, this study was conducted when students\u2019 regular classes were in progress, such that it was challenging to set universal time to conduct FGDs where all intended participants could attend. The researcher was flexible enough to find hours which were conducive for participants to participate in FGDs.\n\n\n\nFor practitioners, given the fact that ChatGPT is a relatively new AI tool, training for raising awareness of its use should be conducted. Besides, specific academic integrity guidelines for its ethical use should be formulated and implemented. Likewise, instructors should set questions that prompt students original thinking which the AI tool cannot easily give contextualized solutions.\n\n\n\nThe university where the AI tool is used is an open system that is within the society, and the impacts of AI technologies are inevitable in social domains. The society, therefore, should be informed about the emerging AI tools with their associated potentials and shortcomings to safeguard the norms and interests of the society.\n\n\n\nThe study provides a comprehensive overview of student teachers\u2019 ChatGPT use and its implication on academic integrity. Given the novelty nature of ChatGPT use in education, course instructors and students may benefit from insights into responsible utilization of this AI technology without compromising integrity and quality of education.\n", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2025-01-14", "synthetic_support_claim": "Student teachers at University of Dar es Salaam often overlook academic integrity when using ChatGPT.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "ChatGPT significantly improves students' understanding and mastery of subject material in their academic courses."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "af9d7afe9aeb87d12bf44b82306c26d195969dc9", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/af9d7afe9aeb87d12bf44b82306c26d195969dc9", "title": "Teachers' Views on Integrating Augmented Reality in Education: Needs, Opportunities, Challenges and Recommendations", "abstract": "The integration of augmented reality (AR) in education is promising since it enhances teaching and offers more engaging and appealing learning experiences.

Data analyzed used Mann Whitney.\nResults: The Mann-Whitney test shows p = 0.001, concluding that there is a difference in the accuracy of depth and compression speed in CPR between the intervention and control groups. This means the\u00a0NAC metronome can improve CPR performance in compression depth and compression rate. CPR uses a neo-automatic code metronome to ensure the user breathes regularly and helps the rescuer to constantly give compression.\nConclusion: Neo automatic code can improve the quality of CPR in Indonesian society.

So, current study was planned to assess the knowledge and attitude about BLS measures among high school students. Methodology: From the four selected schools of Ludhiana district, 400 students of 9th and 10th class were included in the study after approval from school administration. A preformed questionnaire was introduced to the students followed by an interaction on concept of BLS by the investigators. The data was analysed using percentages, proportion and Chi square test for qualitative variables. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results: Out of 400 students, only 128 (31.75%) had heard about BLS/CPR and 30.2% of students had seen someone performing BLS/CPR. Nearly 83% of students did not have any formal training on BLS and 81% felt that their knowledge regarding BLS was insufficient. Approximately 77% students were willing to perform CPR after receiving training and 81% suggested that it should be made part of school curriculum. Higher number of students in the age group of 16-18 years felt the need of BLS training as compared to that in 13-15 years (83.7% vs. 77.6%) and were willing to perform CPR after being trained (82.9% vs. 74.7%). Conclusions: Current knowledge in high school students about BLS is low, yet if given appropriate training, these students have the potential to save lives and moreover, students are willing to learn.

Surgical simulation can be used to improve surgical skills in a secure and risk-free environment. Animal models, simulated patients, virtual reality, and mannequins are some types of surgical simulation. As a result, feedback encourages students to reflect on their strengths and weaknesses, enabling them to focus on improvement. Healthcare simulation is a strong educational instrument, and the main goal of this is to give the students an opportunity to do a practical application of what they have learned through theory. Before taking it to the patients, they will already have certain tools they have previously acquired during the practice. This makes it easier for students to identify the knowledge gaps that they must fill to improve patient outcomes. Moreover, simulation brings a wonderful opportunity for students to acquire skills, gain confidence, and experience success before working with real patients, especially when their clinical exposure is limited. The use of simulation to teach technical skills to surgical trainees has become more prevalent. The cost of setting up a simulation lab ranges from $100,000 to $300,000. There are several ways to evaluate the effectiveness of simulation-based surgical training. Repetitive surgical simulation training can improve speed and fluidity in general surgical skills in comparison to conventional training. Few previous studies compared learners who received structured simulation training to a group of trainees who did not receive any simulation training in single-center randomized control research. Significantly faster and less time-consuming skill proficiency was noticeable in simulated trainees. Despite being anxious in the operating room for the first time, simulated trainees completed the surgery on time, demonstrating the effectiveness of surgical simulation training. Traditional surgical training involves senior-surgeon supervision in the operating room. In simulation-based training, the trainees have full control over clinical scenarios and settings; however, guidance and assessment are also crucial. Simulators allow users to practice tasks under conditions resembling real-life scenarios. Simulators can be compared with traditional surgical training methods for different reasons. For example, intraoperative bleeding may occasionally show up not only visibly on the screen but also by shaking the trocars erratically. Without haptics, training on virtual simulators can cause one's pulling and pushing forces, which are frequently greater than what the tissue needs, to be distorted. A good method of simulation training is using virtual reality simulators with haptics and simulated patients. The availability of these facilities is limited, though, and a typical session might include an exercise involving stacking sugar cubes and box trainers. The degree of expertise or competency is one area that needs clarification as medical education transitions to a competency-based paradigm.

This study explores the usability and effectiveness of Mobile Virtual Patients (MVPs) in supporting healthcare professionals and medical students to develop skills related to symptom management, diagnosis, and treatment in the context of the H2020 SHAPES project for older adults. Fourteen participants, divided into two groups of seven each from the University of Nicosia and Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, respectively, participated in PBL sessions using MVPs. These cases encompassed various conditions, from neurodegenerative diseases to chronic conditions, focusing on participants active engagement and inquiry-based learning. The System Usability Scale (SUS) and the Electronic Virtual Patients (eViP) toolkit were applied, which brought usability, technology acceptance, and clinical reasoning into perspective. Results showed high usability, with healthcare professionals giving an SUS of 86.2, compared to 77.5 for medical students. Both groups reported positive experiences, but medical students rated the learning effect and coaching higher than healthcare professionals. This suggests that MVPs are valuable instruments in enhancing clinical reasoning and knowledge acquisition.

ChatGPT, a freely accessible AI-powered large language model designed to generate human-like text responses to users, has been utilized in several areas, such as the healthcare industry, to facilitate interactive dissemination of information and decision-making. Academic advising has been essential in promoting success among university students, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds. Unfortunately, however, student advising has been marred with problems, with the availability and accessibility of adequate advising being among the hurdles. The current study explores how AI-powered tools like ChatGPT might serve to make academic advising more accessible, efficient, or effective. The authors compiled a list of questions frequently asked by current and prospective students in a teacher education bachelor\u2019s degree program in the United States. Then, the questions were typed into the free version of ChatGPT, and the answers generated were explored and evaluated for their content and delivery. ChatGPT generated surprisingly high-quality answers, written in an authoritative yet supportive tone, and it was particularly adept at addressing general and open-ended career-related questions, such as career outlook, in a clear, comprehensive, and supportive manner using plain language.

These experiences often result in high stress levels that contribute to burnout and, consequently, a breach of teachers\u2019 occupational wellbeing. Promoting positive teacher wellbeing substantially influences teaching quality, with a flow-on effect on student wellbeing and academic development. This literature review utilised a framework to systematically explore the factors that impact the occupational wellbeing of kindergarten, primary, and secondary schoolteachers. Thirty-eight (38) studies from an initial 3766 peer-reviewed articles sourced from various databases (CINAHL, Emcare, PychINFO, Scopus, ERIC, and PsycARTICLES) were utilized for this systematic review. Four major factors were identified, including personal capabilities, socioemotional competence, personal responses to work conditions, and professional relationships. Findings highlight the importance of teachers\u2019 occupational wellbeing in dealing with numerous challenges and competing demands, with the need for a high level of self-efficacy for instruction and behavioural management being critically significant. Teachers require adequate organisational support to successfully carry out their roles with stronger resilience and efficient job execution.

Many of them opted to go entirely online for both teaching and assessment. Even the most reluctant teachers have been forced overnight to adapt their knowledge assessment and examination practices to online methods. This transition took place as a matter of urgency, and the move to online examinations often consisted of reusing traditional methods and adapting them in an ad hoc and empirical manner to the distance communication tools available. After this period, it seems interesting to see how practices have evolved once everyone has been systematically exposed to online and computer-based examinations. Have we returned to the traditional examination methods of the pre-Covid era in a form of epidermal reaction to reject this period? Have we moved on to a massive and voluntary adoption of online modalities? Or are we witnessing another phenomenon that is part of the more general post-digital movement in education that we are currently observing? Well before the COVID epidemic, the University of Geneva had set up an infrastructure and support service enabling teachers to take their exams online on a voluntary basis. This infrastructure was rapidly reinforced to ensure the organization of all distance examinations at the time of the COVID epidemic. In this study, we propose to analyze the evolution of the infrastructure supporting online examinations, before, during and after the COVID epidemic. We also propose to analyze the evolution of examination modalities during these three periods to better understand how the institution adapted and evolved, but also how teachers modified their assessment practices during these periods. We will conclude by discussing the impact that the arrival of AI tools, and in particular generative AI, may have on the use of online and digital examinations.", "publicationTypes": ["Conference"], "publicationDate": "2024-11-06", "synthetic_support_claim": "Online examination practices evolved significantly at the University of Geneva due to the COVID-19 pandemic.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Online examinations have been shown to provide more accurate assessments of student knowledge than traditional methods."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "1cf3968f3e79a5f3557fcd7cfd9fa44429203899", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1cf3968f3e79a5f3557fcd7cfd9fa44429203899", "title": "Mapping Tomorrow\u2019s Teaching and Learning Spaces: A Systematic Review on GenAI in Higher Education", "abstract": "This collective systematic literature review is part of an Erasmus+ project, \u201cTaLAI: Teaching and Learning with AI in Higher Education\u201d.

This increase in complexity presents a twofold challenge for the field of computer architecture. First, no individual architect can fully comprehend the complexity of the entire microarchitecture of the core. This leads to increasingly specialized architects, who treat parts of the core outside their particular expertise as black boxes. Second, with increasing complexity, the field becomes decreasingly accessible to new students of the field. When learning core microarchitecture, new students must first learn the big picture of how the system works in order to understand how the pieces all fit together. The tools used to study microarchitecture experience a similar struggle. As with the microarchitectures they simulate, an increase in complexity reduces accessibility to new users. In this work, we present ChampSim. ChampSim uses a modular design and configurable structure to achieve a low barrier to entry into the field of microarchitecural simulation.

Many workloads, especially those involving large memory, frequently experience TLB misses, making virtual-to-physical address translation a significant performance bottleneck. This issue is even more pronounced on virtualized platforms, such as cloud environments. One major reason for the slow nested or virtualized address translations is that current virtualized systems organize page tables in a multilevel tree structure that is accessed sequentially. As a result, a nested translation may require up to twenty-four sequential memory accesses. To address this challenge, this paper introduces Ninja, a novel hardware-assisted guest page table (gPT) management approach. Ninja leverages hardware to transparently replace the guest physical address (gPA) in frequently accessed gPT entries with the corresponding host physical address (hPA) in the caches. Consequently, Ninja directly offers the guest page table walker with the hPA of the gPT frames, bypassing the traditional gPA\u21d2hPA translation, thus eliminating the need for nested TLB (NTLB) lookups and significantly reducing the number of nested page table walks. Our design ensures that, from the guest operating system's perspective, the gPT entries still contain gPA, maintaining software transparency. In contrast to software-based shadow paging methods, Ninja eliminates VM-exit overhead and additional DRAM usage. Furthermore, in comparison to other cache-based optimization techniques, Ninja does not incur any additional cache occupancy. Evaluations show that Ninja outperforms the hardware-assisted scheme in modern CPUs by 17%. In comparison to the state-of-the-art Victima design, Ninja also achieves 8.5 % speedup.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Conference"], "publicationDate": "2024-11-18", "synthetic_support_claim": "Ninja reduces the number of nested page table walks and eliminates the need for nested TLB lookups.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Ninja can completely eliminate all TLB misses in large memory workloads on virtualized platforms."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "d9ef3aac91105d7f2638bcdcb43c3d3d41678bee", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d9ef3aac91105d7f2638bcdcb43c3d3d41678bee", "title": "Uncovering the Intricacies and Synergies of\u00a0Processor Microarchitecture Mechanisms Using\u00a0Explainable\u00a0AI", "abstract": "This paper defines a data-driven methodology seamlessly combining machine learning (ML) and eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to address the challenge of understanding the intricate relationships between microarchitecture mechanisms with respect to system performance.

The perspective and understanding of medical students are critical for guiding the development of educational curricula and training. Objective This study aims to assess and compare medical AI-related attitudes among medical students in general medicine and in one of the visually oriented fields (pathology), along with illuminating their anticipated role of AI in the rapidly evolving landscape of AI-enhanced health care. Methods This was a cross-sectional study that used a web-based survey composed of a closed-ended questionnaire. The survey addressed medical students at all educational levels across the 5 public medical schools, along with pathology residents in 4 residency programs in Jordan. Results A total of 394 respondents participated (328 medical students and 66 pathology residents). The majority of respondents (272/394, 69%) were already aware of AI and deep learning in medicine, mainly relying on websites for information on AI, while only 14% (56/394) were aware of AI through medical schools. There was a statistically significant difference in awareness among respondents who consider themselves tech experts compared with those who do not (P=.03). More than half of the respondents believed that AI could be used to diagnose diseases automatically (213/394, 54.1% agreement), with medical students agreeing more than pathology residents (P=.04). However, more than one-third expressed fear about recent AI developments (167/394, 42.4% agreed). Two-thirds of respondents disagreed that their medical schools had educated them about AI and its potential use (261/394, 66.2% disagreed), while 46.2% (182/394) expressed interest in learning about AI in medicine. In terms of pathology-specific questions, 75.4% (297/394) agreed that AI could be used to identify pathologies in slide examinations automatically. There was a significant difference between medical students and pathology residents in their agreement (P=.001). Overall, medical students and pathology trainees had similar responses.

When implemented effectively, virtual reality technologies may enable highly engaging learning activities and interactive simulations. However, implementation processes present challenges, and the key to successful implementation is identifying barriers and facilitators as well as finding strategies to address them. Objective This scoping review aimed to identify the literature on virtual reality implementation in health professions education, identify barriers to and facilitators of implementation, and highlight gaps in the literature in this area. Methods The scoping review was conducted based on the Joanna Briggs Institute Evidence Synthesis methodologies. Electronic searches were conducted in the Academic Search Elite, Education Source, and CINAHL databases on January 5, 2022, in Google Scholar on February 2 and November 18, 2022, and in PubMed database on November 18, 2022. We conducted hand searches of key items, reference tracking, and citation tracking and searches on government webpages on February 2, 2022. At least 2 reviewers screened the identified literature. Eligible studies were considered based on predefined inclusion criteria. The results of the identified items were analyzed and synthesized using qualitative content analysis. Results We included 7 papers and identified 7 categories related to facilitators of and barriers to implementation\u2014collaborative participation, availability, expenses, guidelines, technology, careful design and evaluation, and training\u2014and developed a model that links the categories to the 4 constructs from Carl May\u2019s general theory of implementation. All the included reports provided recommendations for implementation, including recommendations for careful design and evaluation, training of faculty and students, and faculty presence during use. Conclusions Virtual reality implementation in health professions education appears to be a new and underexplored research field. This scoping review has several limitations, including definitions and search words, language, and that we did not assess the included papers\u2019 quality. Important implications from our findings are that ensuring faculty\u2019s and students\u2019 competence in using virtual reality technology is necessary for the implementation processes. Collaborative participation by including end users in the development process is another factor that may ensure successful implementation in higher education contexts. To ensure stakeholders\u2019 motivation and potential to use virtual reality, faculty and students could be invited to participate in the development process to ensure that the educational content is valued. Moreover, technological challenges and usability issues should be resolved before implementation to ensure that pedagogical content is the focus. This accentuates the importance of piloting, sufficient time resources, basic testing, and sharing of experiences before implementation.

CTE is an educational domain often overlooked in discussions about teaching and learning and notably omitted in the extant literature about AI\u2019s application in educational settings. Although much of the existing literature focuses on AI in K-12 and higher education, CTE faces distinct challenges and opportunities in both education and the application of AI because CTE programming is more hands-on and industry-connected. This paper, grounded in Diffusion of Innovations theory, examines AI tool adoption processes among CTE educators by analyzing both barriers and opportunities. Key findings suggest that while AI offers significant benefits, its adoption is hindered by systemic factors. This paper contributes to the literature by highlighting the importance of contextualizing AI adoption within the distinct pedagogical practices and industry partnerships of CTE. It emphasizes the need for targeted strategies that address CTE-specific challenges, including robust infrastructure, equitable resource distribution, and fostering a culture of innovation among educators.

Virtual reality (VR) technology offers innovative training solutions to enhance nurses\u2019 clinical skills and preparedness. However, extensive studies on its effectiveness in isolation ward environments are still limited. Objective This study aims to develop a nonimmersive VR (NIVR) simulation training program for isolation wards and further validate its feasibility and training effectiveness in aiding nurses in adapting to isolation ward settings. Methods This study was a prospective, parallel, open-label, randomized controlled trial. A total of 90 nurses from 3 hospitals in China were randomly assigned to either the control or intervention group, with 45 (50%) individuals in each group. Both groups received training on isolation ward layout and nursing procedures. The control group underwent a 4-hour conventional training session consisting of 2 hours of face-to-face lectures and 2 hours of ward visits. The intervention group received a 4-hour NIVR simulation training session. Subsequently, both groups completed approximately 4 hours of emergency drills and assessments. Results After the intervention, there were no significant differences in theoretical test or performance assessment scores between the 2 groups (t88=\u20130.30, P=.75; Cohen d=\u20130.06; z score=0.00, P>.99), using a 2-tailed t test. However, the intervention group completed 6 tasks faster than the control group (t88=5.10, P<.001; Cohen d=1.08), with an average reduction of about 3 minutes (control group: mean 43.91, SD 2.99 min; intervention group: mean 40.77, SD 2.85 min). Notably, they completed task 3 (patient reception inward) and task 6 (exiting the isolation area) significantly quicker (t88=3.22, P=.002; Cohen d=0.68; t88=3.03, P=.003; Cohen d=0.64, respectively), with no significant differences for the other tasks. Conclusions This study highlights the potential of NIVR simulation training for nurses working in isolation wards. Although NIVR simulation training does not significantly surpass traditional methods in imparting theoretical knowledge, it does reduce task completion time for specific activities. Its capacity for safe, repetitive practice and realistic scenario simulation makes NIVR a valuable tool in medical education. Further research and optimization of VR simulation training programs are recommended to enhance nurses\u2019 practical skills and pandemic preparedness.

Several challenges may arise when implementing e-learning, including an insufficient budget or problems with adoption. Nevertheless, the role of digitalization is to ensure the university\u2019s long-term sustainability. Indeed, the future of e-learning depends on future generations, which increasingly accept new technologies. Objectives This study aimed to analyze the factors that stimulate university students\u2019 acceptance of technology. Methodology The study population comprised Romanian university students who took online courses during the COVID-19 pandemic. A questionnaire survey was employed to gather primary data. The surveys were distributed between January and February 2022. In particular, 1,875 questionnaires were received from students, who were the focus of this study (the results for teachers were presented in previous research). To process and interpret the data, the method of modeling with structural equations (SEM) was used. The data collected were processed using SPSS and AMOS.

promoting psychological well-being and creating opportunities for growth. Family and educational systems play a pivotal role in supporting these competencies. This study aims to analyze the relationships between humanization competencies, academic burnout, and family functionality, to examine sex differences in these variables, and to explore the mediating effect of family functionality. Methods The sample comprised 1,092 secondary school students (584 females and 508 males) from Almer\u00eda, Spain, aged 12 to 17 (M =\u202f14.5\u202fyears). Results The findings show that family functionality is positively associated with humanization competencies and academic efficacy, and negatively associated with emotional exhaustion and cynicism. Notable sex differences emerged, with males scoring higher in optimism, self-efficacy, and affect, while females scored higher in sociability and cynicism. Mediation analysis revealed that family functionality partially mediates the relationship between humanization competencies and academic burnout, specifically impacting cynicism, academic efficacy, and emotional exhaustion.

Gamification methods aim to motivate learners to participate in learning by incorporating intrinsic and extrinsic motivational factors. However, the effectiveness of gamification has yielded varying outcomes, prompting researchers to explore adaptive gamification as an alternative approach. Nevertheless, there needs to be more research on adaptive gamification approaches, particularly concerning motivation, which is the primary objective of gamification. In this study, we developed and tested an adaptive gamification environment based on specific motivational and psychological frameworks. This environment incorporated adaptive criteria, learning strategies, gaming elements, and all crucial aspects of science education for six classes of third-grade students in primary school. We employed a quantitative approach to gain insights into the motivational impact on students and their perception of the adaptive gamification application. We aimed to understand how each game element experienced by students influenced their motivation. Based on our findings, students were more motivated to learn science when using an adaptive gamification environment.

Many students still need help achieving optimal academic achievement, which is caused by the lack of holistic support from the home and school environment. Research shows that harmony between the home and school environment plays an important role in shaping students' character, motivation, and positive attitudes towards learning. When parents and educators work together and provide consistent support, students are more likely to develop in natural and social sciences. This study aims to explore the influence of learning interest and learning environment on the learning outcomes of fourth-grade students in science. This study uses a quantitative method with an ex post facto design. The study population was fourth-grade students, with a sample of 66 students selected randomly. Interviews, questionnaires, and recording of learning objectives were used to collect data. Data analysis was carried out using descriptive, simple, and multiple regression techniques.

Key findings reveal a generally positive perception among the teacher educators, who recognize GenAI\u2019s potential to support academic achievement, increase student engagement, and improve communication within teacher education settings. The findings further indicate that the teacher educators\u2019 background factors, such as age, years of teaching experience, department, and college, do not significantly predict their perceptions of GenAI. Since none of these measured background factors were significant predictors, this suggests that training and resources for using GenAI should be broadly prioritized, accessible, and not heavily tailored to specific demographic groups. However, the study identified significant concerns within the barriers and challenges factors, including ethical issues, fairness in student assessment, and possible adverse effects on the teacher educator-student relationship. The communication and independence factors highlight a need for professional development, with teacher educators emphasizing the importance of training in GenAI usage to optimize its educational potential.

Medical students, as early adopters of technology and future health care providers, play a crucial role in shaping the future of health care. However, little is known about the utilization of, perceptions on, and intention to use AI chatbots among medical students in China. Objective This study aims to explore the utilization of, perceptions on, and intention to use generative AI chatbots among medical students in China, using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) framework. By conducting a national cross-sectional survey, we sought to identify the key determinants that influence medical students\u2019 acceptance of AI chatbots, thereby providing a basis for enhancing their integration into medical education. Understanding these factors is crucial for educators, policy makers, and technology developers to design and implement effective AI-driven educational tools that align with the needs and expectations of future health care professionals. Methods A web-based electronic survey questionnaire was developed and distributed via social media to medical students across the country. The UTAUT was used as a theoretical framework to design the questionnaire and analyze the data. The relationship between behavioral intention to use AI chatbots and UTAUT predictors was examined using multivariable regression. Results A total of 693 participants were from 57 universities covering 21 provinces or municipalities in China. Only a minority (199/693, 28.72%) reported using AI chatbots for studying, with ChatGPT (129/693, 18.61%) being the most commonly used. Most of the participants used AI chatbots for quickly obtaining medical information and knowledge (631/693, 91.05%) and increasing learning efficiency (594/693, 85.71%).

The participants who received mostly positive recognition developed research, teaching, and altruistic science identities. Most of the positive recognition was associated with research accomplishments, which is not surprising since doctoral programs in chemistry focus primarily on research training. Conversely, the participants who received mostly negative forms of recognition developed disrupted science identities.

In education, laboratory safety is an essential component of undergraduate laboratory classes. The institution provides formal training for the students working in the labs that involve potential exposure to a wide range of hazards, including chemical, biological, and physical agents. During the laboratory safety lessons, the instructor explains the lab safety protocols and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) to prevent unwanted accidents. However, it is not always guaranteed that students follow safety procedures throughout all lab sessions. Currently, the lab supervisors monitor the use of PPE, which is time consuming, laborious, and impossible to see each student. Consequently, students may unintentionally commit unrecognizable unsafe acts, which can lead to unwanted situations. Therefore, the aim of the research article was to propose a real-time smart vision-based lab-safety monitoring system to verify the PPE compliance of students, i.e., whether the student is wearing a mask, gloves, lab coat, and goggles, from image/video in real time. The YOLOv5 (YOLOv5l, YOLOv5m, YOLOv5n, YOLOv5s, and YOLOv5x) and YOLOv7 models were trained using a self-created novel dataset named SLS (Students Lab Safety). The dataset comprises four classes, namely, gloves, helmets, masks, and goggles, and 481 images, having a resolution of 835 \u00d7 1000, acquired from various research laboratories of the United Arab Emirates University. The performance of the different YOLOv5 and YOLOv7 versions is compared based on instances\u2019 size using evaluation metrics such as precision, F1 score, recall, and mAP (mean average precision). The experimental results demonstrated that all the models showed promising performance in detecting PPE in educational labs.

Despite advancements in safety training, laboratory personnel may still unknowingly engage in unsafe practices. With the increasing reliance on large language models (LLMs) for guidance in various fields, including laboratory settings, there is a growing concern about their reliability in critical safety-related decision-making. Unlike trained human researchers, LLMs lack formal lab safety education, raising questions about their ability to provide safe and accurate guidance. Existing research on LLM trustworthiness primarily focuses on issues such as ethical compliance, truthfulness, and fairness but fails to fully cover safety-critical real-world applications, like lab safety. To address this gap, we propose the Laboratory Safety Benchmark (LabSafety Bench), a comprehensive evaluation framework based on a new taxonomy aligned with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) protocols. This benchmark includes 765 multiple-choice questions verified by human experts, assessing LLMs and vision language models (VLMs) performance in lab safety contexts. Our evaluations demonstrate that while GPT-4o outperforms human participants, it is still prone to critical errors, highlighting the risks of relying on LLMs in safety-critical environments.

METHODS Two cohorts of senior medical students participated in either a 2019 in-person or 2021 virtual advanced communication skills OSCE. Students were grouped in triads and rotated through three of five possible cases. Afterwards, students participated in a faculty-led debrief (in-person in 2019, virtual in 2021). Inductive thematic analysis was used to compare the themes and the ratio of comments related to the themes were compared between the virtual and in-person OSCEs. RESULTS Thematic analyses for both in-person and virtual OSCEs identified the same four major themes (Case Review, Emotional Response, Feedback, and Reflection) and 11 subthemes. However, the ratio of comments related to Case Review was lower in the virtual OSCE compared to in-person (P\u2009<\u2009.0001). Analysis of subthemes within Case Review revealed the percentage of comments was higher for Content and lower for Challenges in the virtual OSCE compared to in-person (both P\u2009<\u2009.0001). There were no differences in the ratios of comments related to Emotional Response, Feedback, and Reflection, or their subthemes. CONCLUSION A virtual advanced communications skills OSCE for medical students showed identical qualitative themes to that from a prior in-person OSCE. However, students in the virtual OSCE focused more on matter-of-fact discussions about case content and less about the challenges they experienced. The findings suggest that some medical students may struggle with experiential learning in the virtual format, and have difficulty accessing or practicing their reflective observation skills based on Kolb's learning theory.

Furthermore, large language models (LLMs) encounter difficulties handling domain-specific formulas, executing reasoning steps accurately, and integrating code effectively when tackling chemical reasoning tasks. To address these challenges, we present ChemAgent, a novel framework designed to improve the performance of LLMs through a dynamic, self-updating library. This library is developed by decomposing chemical tasks into sub-tasks and compiling these sub-tasks into a structured collection that can be referenced for future queries. Then, when presented with a new problem, ChemAgent retrieves and refines pertinent information from the library, which we call memory, facilitating effective task decomposition and the generation of solutions. Our method designs three types of memory and a library-enhanced reasoning component, enabling LLMs to improve over time through experience.

It involves developing positive human qualities that lead to an optimistic outlook on life and greater job satisfaction (Rehal &Nieuwerburgh, 2022). Research indicates that flourishing improves work outcomes, including increased productivity and reduced turnover (Freire et al., 2020). The Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) model (Demerouti et al., 2001; Bakker & Demerouti, 2017) suggests that job resources, such as social support, can help reduce the negative effects of workplace stress on employee well-being.This study examines the role of social support from coworkers, supervisors, and organizations in buffering emotional exhaustion, which negatively impacts flourishing, particularly in the higher education sector. Data was collected via an online survey from 750 academicians across Pakistan. The analysis revealed that social support significantly moderates the relationship between emotional exhaustion and flourishing. Support from colleagues, department heads, and organizations enables academicians to cope with workplace demands, promoting well-being and productivity.The study concludes that strengthening social networks is essential to reduce emotional exhaustion and enhance flourishing, particularly in resource-constrained institutions like Pakistani universities.

This research was motivated by the researcher's academic anxiety, namely the existence of a gap in the implementation of deradicalization. The deradicalization currently being carried out by the government, whether through the BNPT, Densus 88 AT Polri, the Directorate General of Corrections or community groups is not well organized, especially regarding the role of institutions, materials (clarification of several points of Islamic teachings that are often misinterpreted) and delivery approaches. This shows the importance of a more in-depth study of how to manage the deradicalization of terrorism based on basic Islamic teachings so that it can run in a programmed, targeted and sustainable manner.\nPurpose. This research aims to describe, analyze and discover the concept of implementation and management of terrorism deradicalization. This research answers two main problems, namely first how to conceptualize deradicalization and second how to implement deradicalization management.\nMethod.

Articles were selected from Scopus and Web of Science databases that included \"nomophobia\" and \"education\" in the title, abstract, or keywords, and that were open access. The final analysis included 30 articles organized into 14 thematic categories. The most addressed topics were consequences, causes, levels, and factors that determine nomophobia. It was found that excessive mobile device use is mainly due to the constant need to stay connected and the fear of missing out on social media information. This technological dependence manifests in symptoms such as anxiety, stress, nervousness, and physical health problems, such as thumb and wrist pain, visual fatigue, and sleep disturbances. Nomophobia negatively impacts academic performance by interfering with the attention and concentration necessary for learning. Although educational technology does not seem to be a risk factor, it is crucial to promote a balanced use of mobile devices. Family intervention and education on the risks of excessive mobile use are essential to mitigate these effects and foster healthy technology use. \n\u00a0 \nReceived: 2 August 2024 / Accepted: 30 October 2024 / Published: 05 November 2024", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2024-11-05", "synthetic_support_claim": "Excessive mobile device use among university students is driven by the fear of missing out.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Nomophobia leads to an increase in substance abuse among university students."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "309a31e114ab98c693412a5b1a74bb898a9848bc", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/309a31e114ab98c693412a5b1a74bb898a9848bc", "title": "Nomofobia en estudiantes universitarios gallegos: An\u00e1lisis de la prevalencia y factores influyentes", "abstract": "Introducci\u00f3n: El presente estudio aborda la prevalencia y los factores de incidencia de la nomofobia entre estudiantes universitarios gallegos.

Additionally, AI can be used to communicate with students in a more natural and human-like way, making the learning experience more engaging and interactive. Another key aspect of the integration of AI and the IoT in education obtained from this research is the ability to provide real-time feedback and support. IoT-enabled devices, such as smart cameras and microphones, can be used to monitor student engagement and provide real-time feedback. AI algorithms can then use these data to adapt the learning experience in real time. IoT-enabled devices, such as tablets and laptops, can be used to collect and process student work, allowing for the automatic grading of assignments and assessments. Additionally, IoT technology can facilitate remote monitoring and grading of student work, which would be particularly useful for students who cannot attend traditional classroom settings. Furthermore, AI and the IoT can also be used to create intelligent personal learning environments (PLEs) that provide students with personalized, adaptive, and engaging learning experiences. IoT-enabled devices, such as smart cameras and microphones, combined with AI-powered algorithms, can provide real-time feedback and support, allowing the PLE to adapt to the student\u2019s needs and preferences. It is concluded that integrating AI and the IoT in sustainable education can revolutionize the way people learn, providing students with personalized, real-time feedback and support and opening up new opportunities for remote and disadvantaged students.

Given these issues, this study explores the reasons of their perceived challenges. Using a qualitative approach, in-depth interviews were conducted with teachers to gain insights into the difficulties they face. First, the Linguistic barriers, such as English as second language (ESL) learners don't know English well enough. It's hard for them to understand & take part in class. Teachers have to make things simpler & change how they teach. Second, Pedagogical adjustments, where teachers use more pictures & hands-on stuff. This means more work for them. They're trying to teach both the subject & English at the same time. Lastly lack of institutional support signifies that teachers don't get enough training or the right tools to teach in English. To fix this issues, it is needed to help students get better at English performance. In addition, teachers should be given special training. Finally, it should be made sure that teachers have the right stuff to teach in English. These support mechanisms are crucial for improving the effectiveness of EMI in Pakistani classrooms. The study concludes that without addressing these challenges and eradicating psychological barriers the success of EMI in Pakistan will remain limited, as teachers continue to face the dual burden of teaching both content and language without sufficient institutional backing.

Relevant peer and nonpeer-reviewed English-language articles on studies implementing an intervention with loneliness as an outcome and investigating undergraduate or postgraduate students at a higher education institution were included for quality analysis and narrative synthesis. Risk of bias was assessed at both study level and at outcome level.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTwenty-eight articles were included, comprising 25 quantitative and three qualitative studies, covering 37 interventions, most implemented in the United States. Interventions were based on psychoeducation, social support groups, increasing social interaction or reflective exercises. The age of the participants (n\u00a0=\u20092339) ranged from 17.62 to 25 (mean age 20.63) years.

Experiencing high levels of stress for a longer period of time has been associated with an increased risk for lower mental wellbeing and mental health problems. To reduce stress and improve mental wellbeing it is important to understand how various sources of stress are related with mental wellbeing and which factors can buffer the impact of stress on mental wellbeing. Objectives Deriving from a conceptual model the aim of the study was to explore 1) the association of underlying stressors (academic pressure, family circumstances, side-activity pressure, and financial situation) with perceived stress and mental wellbeing, 2) whether perceived stress mediates the association between the sources of stress and mental wellbeing and 3) whether loneliness, self-esteem, personality and coping styles buffer or reinforce the impact of perceived stress on mental wellbeing. Method A cross-sectional survey design was used among students of an University of Applied Sciences and conducted between November 16, 2020, and January 18, 2021. Study variables were mental wellbeing, perceived stress, academic pressure, financial pressure, family pressure and side-activity pressure, coping style, self-esteem, loneliness, personality. The questionnaire was constructed using validated measures. Simple and multiple linear regression analyses were conducted to assess the association between perceived stress, sources of stress and mental wellbeing. Mediation and moderation processes were explored using Hayes PROCESS models. Results A total of 875 university students (37,2% male, 62,3% female, mean age 21,6) participated. Perceived stress had a strong negative association with mental wellbeing (unstandardized regression coefficient (b) = -.848, p < .001; r = -.667, p < .01), explaining 45% of the variance. Academic pressure (b = -8.014, p < .01), family pressure (b = -3.189, p < .01), side-activity pressure (b = -3.032, p < .01) and financial pressure (b = -2.041, p < .01) all had a negative impact on mental wellbeing. This effect was mediated by perceived stress, but a direct effect remained for academic pressure (b = -3.306, p < .01) and family pressure (b = -1.130, p < .01). Significant interaction effects between perceived stress and mental wellbeing were found for approach coping (low = -.93, p < .01; high = -.64, p < .01) and emotional stability (low = -.81, p < .01; high = -.64, p < .01). Conclusion Perceived stress has a major impact on students\u2019 mental wellbeing. Underlying stressors were mediated by perceived stress, but direct effects were also found.

This study examines the impact of ChatGPT in higher STEM education, drawing on scientific articles published between 2020 and 2024. It explores whether ChatGPT produces positive learning outcomes, the potential approaches for its application now and in the future, and its effectiveness as a teaching tool. Findings from this literature review highlight the numerous benefits of using ChatGPT in higher STEM education. These benefits include improved opportunities for students to engage with AI technology, the provision of personalised support that meets individual learning needs, and an overall increase in the quality of the learning experience. Furthermore, ChatGPT enables greater accessibility of information, which encourages deeper learning and better knowledge retention. Despite these advantages, it is crucial to acknowledge the ethical considerations and biases inherent in AI models that must be addressed. Empirical evidence suggests that ChatGPT significantly improves student engagement by delivering personalised responses tailored to individual learning needs, offering timely and constructive feedback and making information more easily accessible. Together, these factors contribute to improved educational outcomes and encourage the development of students' critical thinking skills. The inclusion of ChatGPT in educational contexts marks a transformative shift in teacher roles, moving away from traditional content delivery methods.

We employed various AI prompting techniques: Zero Shot, in context learning, and confirmatory checking, which merges chain of thought reasoning with reflection. The proficiency of gpt-3.5-turbo varied across academic levels: it scored an average of 83.4% on GCSE, 63.8% on A-Level, and 37.4% on university-level questions, with an overall average of 59.9% using the most effective prompting technique.

Teacher presence and self-other presence of the learners were experimentally manipulated. A humanoid artificial agent, visible on all of the slides of the online course material and instructing the material represented the teacher. The avatars of the learners (self-avatar and peer avatars) were kept of minimal functionality but self-avatars were preselected or could be self-selected by the learners. The learner\u2019s cognitive learning performance, the learner\u2019s attention to the pedagogical agent, their sense of teacher presence and of self- and other-presence, their satisfaction with the course as well as the learner\u2019s previous learning experiences were measured by cognitive testing, self-report, and linguistic analysis as major performance indicators and a positive learning experience. The analysis comprised 133 university students and results were additionally compared for two subsamples.Learning performance, learning satisfaction, and the attention paid to the teacher were positively related. In addition, positive evaluations of the cognitive presence elicited by the teacher were found. Self- or other-presence of avatars did not significantly influence the learner\u2019s performance beyond teacher presence but the learner\u2019s perception of it and their motivation to study online.The study and its results extend the previous literature that focused on the effects of pedagogical agents in online teaching or on virtual representations of the learner\u2019s self and classmates in online learning.

However, there is a notable gap in the research on how these factors specifically impact programming achievement and learning intentions. Our study addresses this gap by focusing on flowchart\u2010based programming\u2014a relatively underexplored area in educational research. To ensure relevance to the educational context, AbilixChart and Ability Storm SK902 were specifically selected for their alignment with the curriculum of the target school, where these tools are widely utilised in both teaching and extracurricular activities. This alignment allowed for a seamless integration of these tools into regular classroom practices after the study's conclusion, ensuring continued application and maximising the study's practical impact. Furthermore, integrating educational robots enhanced student engagement and provided a practical means to evaluate the accuracy of their programming skills.

Its core principle revolves around the integration of elements from games into non-game environments with the ultimate goal of shaping behavior, enhancing motivation, and fostering increased engagement (Caponetto, 2014). The main aim of this study is to investigate the impact of gamification on student motivation and academic performance in the specific context of teaching English as a foreign language (EFL) at higher education institutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina. To conduct this study, a cohort of 202 students attending both private and public universities in Bosnia and Herzegovina was carefully selected using targeted snowball sampling techniques. The questionnaire distributed to the participants included 57 items from various areas, including academic achievement, frequency and proficiency in using language learning apps, motivation and attitudes towards app-based language learning, and perceived improvements in listening, speaking, reading and writing skills This is attributed to the use of apps to learn the English language (ELL). To analyze the gathered data, descriptive statistics, tests for normality, reliability analysis, and linear regression were employed. The results of the study indicate a significant impact of gamification strategies on students\u2019 motivation to learn English as a foreign language, as well as their overall success in EFL learning and academic achievement. In higher education settings, the inclusion of games has been shown to have a positive impact on students\u2019 listening, speaking, reading and writing skills. In addition, gamification contributes to the motivation of the students and thus increases their academic performance.

Results The results showed that, among Chinese college students, there were positive correlations between academic self-efficacy and both academic achievement and learning engagement, and between learning engagement and academic achievement. Additionally, a structural equation model demonstrated that learning engagement could mediate the association between academic self-efficacy and achievement. Conclusion Academic self-efficacy, learning engagement, and academic achievement were found to be significantly and positively associated in Chinese college students, with the association between self-efficacy and achievement observed to be significantly mediated by learning engagement, which mediates the link between self-efficacy and achievement.

However, not all teachers are prepared for this. Despite this, the sudden changes caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have compelled schools to adopt digital technology tools (DTT) to continue the teaching-learning process. This rapid shift called for greater support and training for educators to adapt effectively. Using a mixed-methods design, this paper explored the usage and effectiveness of DTT in science teaching in public junior high schools in Caloocan City, Philippines. Through purposive sampling, 41 science teachers from three schools participated by answering a questionnaire. It revealed that Messenger, PowerPoint, and Google Meet were the most used DTT during online teaching, while Messenger, PowerPoint, and Canva were the most effective. Messenger facilitates communication, PowerPoint enhances lesson delivery through visual presentations, Google Meet enables virtual interactions, and Canva allows teachers to create engaging and visually appealing materials. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) did not reveal significant relationships between demographics and DTT usage of science teachers; it suggested other areas to explore, such as years of teaching, which might influence their preferences for specific DTT like Messenger or Zoom. In the face-to-face classes, teachers continued DTT usage \u2013 most teachers used PowerPoint, Messenger, and Canva, which were also the most effective DTT for them.

In this guest editorial, we discuss the potential impact of GAI for engineering education as researchers and teachers. We see this editorial as the start of a serious dialogue within the community around how GAI can and will change our practices, and what we can do to respond to these shifts. GAI is built on foundational models (FMs) that can be adapted to various other tasks, such as large language models (LLMs), and they operate by learning from many examples and becoming very good at predicting the subsequent probable output or output sequence. Given the abundance of digitized data, they can quickly learn a wide range of topics and respond to user queries almost instantly. Whether engineering a new software application, writing a code snippet to analyze data, designing a product, or composing a cover letter for a job application, GAI users can leverage the power of LLMs to generate outputs that meet their specific needs (UNESCO, 2023). The ability to learn a skill and adapt it to new contexts is a capability that humans have excelled at for a long time. Some would even argue that the competence to learn original things in new environments to tackle novel problems, and teach it to others, is one of the most unique characteristics of our species (Tomasello, 2009). To assist us in this process, we also have the capability to continually create tools and techniques, another distinct trait of humans and central to the engineering profession (Johri, 2022). What, though, is the potential and limit of developing tools and technologies that can mimic and even go beyond what we have conceived of as human intelligence? What potential consequences do technology that can generate novel outputs have for society, especially education in terms of both benefits and harms (Bommasani et al., 2021; Farrokhnia et al., 2023)? What implications does this have for engineering educators (Johri, 2020)? While we discuss how GAI shapes research and teaching practices within engineering education, we recognize that there are additional implications for the use of GAI for self-motivated and sustained learning initiated by learners on their own.

The current study aimed to identify the effect of explanations of an automated essay scoring system on students\u2019 trust and motivation. The explanations were designed using a needs-elicitation study with students in combination with guidelines and frameworks of explainable AI. Two types of explanations were tested: full-text global explanations and an accuracy statement.

Technological advances such as artificial intelligence (AI) and particularly machine learning (ML) may support this cause: it may provide students with an opportunity for easily accessible and readily available communication training. Objective This scoping review aimed to summarize the status quo regarding the use of AI or ML in the acquisition of communication skills in academic health care professions. Methods We conducted a comprehensive literature search across the PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Web of Science Core Collection, and CINAHL databases to identify articles that covered the use of AI or ML in communication skills training of undergraduate students pursuing health care profession education. Using an inductive approach, the included studies were organized into distinct categories. The specific characteristics of the studies, methods and techniques used by AI or ML applications, and main outcomes of the studies were evaluated. Furthermore, supporting and hindering factors in the use of AI and ML for communication skills training of health care professionals were outlined. Results The titles and abstracts of 385 studies were identified, of which 29 (7.5%) underwent full-text review. Of the 29 studies, based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 12 (3.1%) were included. The studies were organized into 3 distinct categories: studies using AI and ML for text analysis and information extraction, studies using AI and ML and virtual reality, and studies using AI and ML and the simulation of virtual patients, each within the academic training of the communication skills of health care professionals. Within these thematic domains, AI was also used for the provision of feedback. The motivation of the involved agents played a major role in the implementation process. Reported barriers to the use of AI and ML in communication skills training revolved around the lack of authenticity and limited natural flow of language exhibited by the AI- and ML-based virtual patient systems. Furthermore, the use of educational AI- and ML-based systems in communication skills training for health care professionals is currently limited to only a few cases, topics, and clinical domains. Conclusions The use of AI and ML in communication skills training for health care professionals is clearly a growing and promising field with a potential to render training more cost-effective and less time-consuming. Furthermore, it may serve learners as an individualized and readily available exercise method. However, in most cases, the outlined applications and technical solutions are limited in terms of access, possible scenarios, the natural flow of a conversation, and authenticity.

Methods: Various studies involving conversational virtual patients were analyzed to determine the effect of these digital tools on clinical competencies. The hybrid review process incorporated both human assessments and AI-driven reviews, allowing a comparison of accuracy between the two approaches. Results: Consistent with previous systematic reviews, our findings suggest that conversational virtual patients can improve clinical competencies, particularly in history-taking and clinical reasoning. Regarding student feedback, satisfaction tends to be higher when virtual patients\u2019 interactions are more realistic, often due to the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) in the simulators.

In 4 studies, a 3D avatar was incorporated into the AI tool to serve as a Virtual Patient. The studies focused on various learning objectives, with 4 studies emphasizing communication skills enhancement. The remaining 3 studies used the AI tool to assess students' knowledge and clinical skills. Clinical scenarios were predominantly used, and in studies with a 3D avatar, scenarios addressed theoretical knowledge, critical thinking, and decision-making in escalating clinical conditions. Endpoints of AI implementation were assessed using self-reported questionnaires, interview and direct feedback from the Chatbot. Consistent endpoints included students' self-efficacy, knowledge of the learning objective, students' satisfaction and attitudes toward the learning style.\nConclusions: As technology continues to advance, the potential for AI in nursing education is becoming increasingly evident. Given that nursing is an interactive science, it seems that AI Chatbots are more useful in nursing education. Further AI implementation will enrich our understanding of how its integration will serve nursing education.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2025-01-05", "synthetic_support_claim": "AI Chatbots are useful in enhancing communication skills in nursing education.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "AI significantly improves patient care outcomes when integrated into nursing education."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "635182e76b89ff049fc755cb9f6cb41437e57780", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/635182e76b89ff049fc755cb9f6cb41437e57780", "title": "A bibliometric analysis of artificial intelligence chatbots in educational contexts", "abstract": "\nPurpose\nThe application of artificial intelligence chatbots is an emerging trend in educational technology studies for its multi-faceted advantages. However, the existing studies rarely take a perspective of educational technology application to evaluate the application of chatbots to educational contexts. This study aims to bridge the research gap by taking an educational perspective to review the existing literature on artificial intelligence chatbots.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThis study combines bibliometric analysis and citation network analysis: a bibliometric analysis through visualization of keyword, authors, organizations and countries and a citation network analysis based on literature clustering.\n\n\nFindings\nEducational applications of chatbots are still rising in post-COVID-19 learning environments. Popular research issues on this topic include technological advancements, students\u2019 perception of chatbots and effectiveness of chatbots in different educational contexts. Originating from similar technological and theoretical foundations, chatbots are primarily applied to language education, educational services (such as information counseling and automated grading), health-care education and medical training. Diversifying application contexts demonstrate specific purposes for using chatbots in education but are confronted with some common challenges. Multi-faceted factors can influence the effectiveness and acceptance of chatbots in education. This study provides an extended framework to facilitate extending artificial intelligence chatbot applications in education.\n\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nThe authors have to acknowledge that this study is subjected to some limitations. First, the literature search was based on the core collection on Web of Science, which did not include some existing studies. Second, this bibliometric analysis only included studies published in English. Third, due to the limitation in technological expertise, the authors could not comprehensively interpret the implications of some studies reporting technological advancements. However, this study intended to establish its research significance by summarizing and evaluating the effectiveness of artificial intelligence chatbots from an educational perspective.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThis study identifies the publication trends of artificial intelligence chatbots in educational contexts. It bridges the research gap caused by previous neglection of treating educational contexts as an interconnected whole which can demonstrate its characteristics. It identifies the major application contexts of artificial intelligence chatbots in education and encouraged further extending of applications. It also proposes an extended framework to consider that covers three critical components of technological integration in education when future researchers and instructors apply artificial intelligence chatbots to new educational contexts.\n", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-03-28", "synthetic_support_claim": "Educational chatbots are rising in post-COVID-19 learning environments, emphasizing language education and automated grading.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Chatbots can entirely replace human educators in the classroom setting."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "a87742db8c4357b68f08c3ec978a2571707dc4e4", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a87742db8c4357b68f08c3ec978a2571707dc4e4", "title": "Bibliometric Analysis of Studies on the Artificial Intelligence in Science Education with VOSviewer", "abstract": "Understanding the trends and developments in artificial intelligence research in science education, which has rapidly advanced in recent years, is crucial for technological innovations and applications in education.

Career adaptability is a key indicator of career development for middle school students and a crucial ability for achieving career success. Research indicates that many Chinese middle school students face significant hurdles in their career development, including a lack of motivation, limited self-awareness, and unclear career trajectories. Objective To address these challenges, it is imperative to explore the factors influencing career adaptability, with a particular focus on the role of parental and teacher autonomy support within the framework of self-determination theory. This study aims to explore the correlation between parental autonomy support (PAS), teacher autonomy support (TAS), core self-evaluations (CSE), and career adaptability (CA) among middle school students. Methodology The longitudinal data for this study were collected from two middle schools in the Anhui province. Middle school students were recruited as research participants through a cluster sampling method. A total of 482 students were surveyed in three stages during a 1-year period, and a cross-lag model was employed to analyze the data. Results (1) From T1 to T2, T1PAS predicted T2CS, T1CSE predicted T2CA, and T1CA predicted T2TA; (2) from T2 to T3, T2PAS predicted T3CS, T2CSE predicted T3CA, and T2TAS predicted T3PAS; (3) TAS did not predict CSE and CA over time; (4) T2CSE mediated the relationship between T1PAS and T3CA. Discussion These findings suggest that autonomy support has a consistently positive influence on the career development of early adolescents.

A fNIRS Study.", "abstract": "Previous research suggests that book reading and screen time have contrasting effects on language and brain development. However, few studies have explicitly investigated whether children's brains function differently during these two activities. The present study used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to measure brain response in 28 typically developing preschool-aged children (36-72 months old) during two conditions-a book reading condition, in which children listened to a story read by a live experimenter while viewing words and pictures in a book, and a screen time condition, in which children listened to a story that was played via an audio recording while viewing words and pictures on a screen. Analyses revealed significant activation in the right temporal parietal junction (TPJ) during the book reading condition only. Across regions of interest (ROIs), including the inferior and middle frontal gyrus (IMFG), the superior and middle temporal gyrus (SMTG), and the TPJ, brain response during the book reading condition was greater in right-lateralized ROIs than left-lateralized ROIs, while brain response during the screen time condition was similar across left and right ROIs. Findings suggest that the lateralization of preschool-aged children's brain function within these ROIs differs during book reading and screen time, which provides a possible neurobiological explanation for why book reading and screen time impact language development in such different ways.

Participants were randomly assigned to two conditions: receiving a prompt (i.e., experimental; n = 94) and no prompt (i.e., control; n = 112). The results revealed that participants who received the elaboration prompt (M = 13.88, SD = 2.20) did not outperform learners who did not receive the prompt (M = 13.67, SD = 2.43) on the knowledge test.

Twelve themes emerged from an exploratory thematic analysis, wherein participants were asked about the learning strategies they used when reading the passage. Students used a variety of learning strategies unprompted, although 42.15% reported not using any additional learning strategies outside of the prompt or using low-utility learning strategies (e.g., relying on memory, skimming). Further exploratory analyses found that the quantity and diversity of learning strategies used individually influenced knowledge test performance.

LBL consisted of interactive lectures with clear objectives, while PBL involved group-based problem solving over two months. Academic outcomes were assessed via class tests, with feedback gathered through a structured questionnaire. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 21.0. Results: A total of 131 final year BDS students were included. Both genders were considered however majority were females (74%). Mostly participants appreciated both teaching methodologies (58%), a significant proportion favored lecture-based learning (26%) over problem-based learning (11.5%). Perceptions varied on the effectiveness of each method in fostering understanding, self-learning habits, and analytical skills. Many participants expressed dissatisfaction with resource availability and syllabus coverage in PBL sessions, despite positive views on facilitator training. Exam results showed a higher pass rate with PBL (76.3%) compared to LBL (56.5%), but satisfaction with PBL did not significantly influence exam outcomes (p>0.05). Conclusions: The study concluded that future research should focus on optimizing educational methodologies in dental education to effectively prepare students for the complex demands of healthcare through innovative and balanced approaches.\u00a0\n\u00a0", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-01-31", "synthetic_support_claim": "Exam results showed a higher pass rate with PBL (76.3%) compared to LBL (56.5%).", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Problem-Based Learning leads to significantly higher long-term knowledge retention compared to Lecture-Based Learning."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "0595daa35e56da17dceb267c83a12e91dbabf475", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0595daa35e56da17dceb267c83a12e91dbabf475", "title": "Project-Based Learning Via Traditional Game in Physics Learning: Its Impact on Critical Thinking, Creative Thinking, and Collaborative Skills", "abstract": "This study aims to investigate how PjBL via traditional games impact students\u2019 critical thinking, creative thinking, and collaborative skills.

It aims to explore the adoption and impact of e-learning across diverse educational settings, focusing on its effectiveness, quality and potential challenges. Furthermore, this research delves into the often-overlooked role of psychological resources and capabilities, particularly Psychological Capital (PsyCap), in enhancing academic performance among university students engaged in e-learning. By investigating the influence of psychological resources and their intersection with e-learning, this study seeks to contribute to a deeper understanding of the factors that shape successful e-learning experiences and academic achievement.Design/methodology/approachIn this research methodology, data was collected from an e-learning institution, with a focus on students in various computer science semesters to ensure comprehensive representation. To minimize standard method bias, a random sampling technique was employed, and data collection was conducted with the support of locally hired research associates. Participant confidentiality and anonymity were carefully preserved, and ethical approval was obtained. The study began with demographic data collection and an assessment of PsyCap dimensions. Most measurements were self-reported, except for GPA, retrieved from the institute directly. The study initially involved 468 students, but only 213 provided complete responses, resulting in a 46% response rate. Demographic data included age, marital status and gender. The sample featured diverse generational representation, with 58% from Generation Z, 13% Millennials, 22% Generation X and 6% Baby Boomers. This comprehensive data will help analyse generational influences on e-learning outcomes.FindingsThe study\u2019s findings underscore the significance of self-efficacy, hope, resilience and optimism in e-learning success. Higher self-efficacy positively impacts student engagement, aligning with previous research. PsyCap, which includes these traits, proves relevant in educational settings. Resilience is notably beneficial, aiding students in overcoming challenges and bolstering their self-belief. Hope enhances problem-solving and adaptability, while optimism fosters a proactive attitude and perseverance, both vital for academic excellence. These insights have broad implications for e-learning practices, emphasizing the need to nurture psychological resources. Incorporating PsyCap-based interventions can enhance the educational experience, promoting student success.Research limitations/implicationsThis study has certain limitations that should be considered. It focused exclusively on computer science students, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Future research should encompass a wider range of academic disciplines for broader applicability. The study was conducted within a specific cultural and regional context, emphasizing a collectivist culture in an Asian setting. To enhance the applicability of the results, it is crucial to explore different regions and cultural contexts. While the study controlled for generational cohort effects on academic performance, further investigation is warranted to understand how different generational cohorts perceive e-learning. Additionally, the study suggests examining how psychological resources influence students' perceptions of e-learning as a stressor or motivator. Furthermore, a comprehensive study comparing the impact of PsyCap on academic performance in both e-learning and traditional education, involving diverse samples and various cultural settings, is needed to provide a more comprehensive understanding.Originality/valueThis research contributes by thoroughly examining the impact of e-learning in diverse educational settings, focusing on its effectiveness, quality and potential challenges. A novel aspect is the exploration of the often-overlooked role of PsyCap in enhancing academic performance among university students engaged in e-learning. This sheds light on the intersection of psychological resources and e-learning. Additionally, the study\u2019s rigorous research methodology underscores its commitment to ethical and responsible research conduct.

Due to the powerful representation ability of deep neural networks, remarkable progress has been made by using deep learning techniques to solve the KT problem. The majority of existing approaches rely on the homogeneous question assumption that questions have equivalent contributions if they share the same set of knowledge components. Unfortunately, this assumption is inaccurate in real-world educational scenarios. Furthermore, it is very challenging to interpret the prediction results from the existing deep learning based KT models. Therefore, in this paper, we present QIKT, a question-centric interpretable KT model to address the above challenges. The proposed QIKT approach explicitly models students\u2019 knowledge state variations at a \ufb01ne-grained level with question-sensitive cognitive representations that are jointly learned from a question-centric knowledge acquisition module and a question-centric problem solving module. Meanwhile, the QIKT utilizes an item response theory based prediction layer to generate interpretable prediction results. The proposed QIKT model is evaluated on three public real-world educational datasets.

The primary contribution of this exploratory research is how educational research informs technological advances in triggering a virtual AI companion (AIC) for children in need of social-emotional and communication skills development. The AIC adapts to students\u2019 varying levels of needed support. This project began by using puppetry control (human-in-the-loop) of the AIC, assisting students with ASD in learning basic coding, practicing their social skills with the AIC, and attaining emotional recognition and regulation skills for effective communication and learning. The student is given the challenge to program a robot, Dash\u2122, to move in a square. Based on observed behaviors, the puppeteer controls the virtual agent\u2019s actions to support the student in coding the robot. The virtual agent\u2019s actions that inform the development of the AIC include speech, facial expressions, gestures, respiration, and heart color changes coded to indicate emotional state. The paper provides exploratory findings of the first 2 years of this 5-year scaling-up research study. The outcomes discussed align with a common approach of research design used for students with disabilities, called single case study research. This type of design does not involve random control trial research; instead, the student acts as her or his own control subject. Students with ASD have substantial individual differences in their social skill deficits, behaviors, communications, and learning needs, which vary greatly from the norm and from other individuals identified with this disability.

Group composition within the educational setting may play a role in determining the academic achievement, socio\u2010emotional development, and wellbeing of students with SEN. Proponents of inclusion propose that segregated educational placement causes stigmatisation and social isolation which may have detrimental effects on the self\u2010concept and self\u2010confidence of students with SEN. On the other hand, opponents of inclusion for all special needs students suggest that placement in general education classrooms may have adverse effects especially if the time and resources allocated for individualisation are not aligned with student needs. Since the 1980s, a number of reviews on the effects of inclusion have been published. Results are inconsistent, and several reviews point to a number of methodological challenges and weaknesses of the study designs within primary studies. In sum, the impact of inclusion on students with SEN may be hypothesised to be both positive and negative, and the current knowledge base is inconsistent. Objectives The objective was first: To uncover and synthesise data from contemporary studies to assess the effects of inclusion on measures of academic achievement, socio\u2010emotional development, and wellbeing of children with special needs when compared to children with special needs who receive special education in a segregated setting. A secondary objective was to explore how potential moderators (gender, age, type and severity of special need, part or full time inclusive education, and co\u2010teaching) relate to outcomes. Search Methods Relevant studies were identified through electronic searches in Academic Search Premier (EBSCO), APA PsycINFO (EBSCO), EconLit (EBSCO), ERIC (EBSCO), International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (ProQuest), Sociological Abstracts (ProQuest), Science Citation Index Expanded (Web Of Science), Social Sciences Citation Index (Web Of Science), and SocINDEX (EBSCO). The database searches were completed on 24 April 2021 and other resources: grey literature repositories, hand search in targeted journals and Internet search engines were searched in August/September 2021. The search was limited to studies reported after 2000. Selection Criteria The review included studies of children with special needs in grades K to 12 in the OECD countries. Children with all types of verifiable SEN were eligible. Inclusion refers to an educational setting with a mixture of children with and without SEN. Segregation refers to the separate education of children with SEN. All studies that compared inclusive versus segregated educational settings for children with SEN were eligible. Qualitative studies were not included. Data Collection and Analysis The total number of potentially relevant studies constituted 20,183 hits. A total of 94 studies met the inclusion criteria, all were non\u2010randomised studies. The 94 studies analysed data from 19 different countries. Only 15 studies could be used in the data synthesis. Seventy\u2010nine studies could not be used in the data synthesis as they were judged to be of critical risk of bias and, in accordance with the protocol, were excluded from the meta\u2010analysis on the basis that they would be more likely to mislead than inform. The 15 studies came from nine different countries. Separate meta\u2010analyses were conducted on conceptually distinct outcomes. All analyses were inverse variance weighted using random effects statistical models. Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the robustness of pooled effect sizes across components of risk of bias. Main Results The average baseline year of the interventions analysed in the 15 studies used for meta\u2010analysis was 2006, ranging from 1998 to 2012. The average number of participants analysed in the interventions was 151, ranging from 10 to 1357, and the average number of controls was 261, ranging from 5 to 2752. The studies included children with multiple types of disabilities such as learning disorders/intellectual disabilities, autism spectrum disorders, ADHD, physical handicaps, visual impairments, and Down syndrome. At most, the results from eight studies could be pooled in any of the meta\u2010analyses. All the meta\u2010analyses showed a weighted average that favoured the intervention group. None of them were statistically significant. The random effects weighted standardised mean difference was 0.20 (95% confidence interval [CI]: \u22120.01 to 0.42) for overall psychosocial adjustment; 0.04 (95% CI: \u22120.27 to 0.35) for language and literacy learning outcomes, and 0.05 (95% CI: \u22120.16 to 0.26) for math learning outcomes. There were no appreciable changes in the results as indicated by the sensitivity analyses. There was some inconsistency in the direction and magnitude of the effect sizes between the primary studies in all analyses and a moderate amount of heterogeneity. We attempted to investigate the heterogeneity by single factor sub\u2010group analyses, but results were inconclusive. Authors'\u00a0Conclusions The overall methodological quality of the included studies was low, and no experimental studies in which children were randomly assigned to intervention and control conditions were found. The 15 studies, which could be used in the data synthesis, were all, except for one, judged to be in serious risk of bias. Results of the meta\u2010analyses do not suggest on average any sizeable positive or negative effects of inclusion on children's academic achievement as measured by language, literacy, and math outcomes or on the overall psychosocial adjustment of children. The average point estimates favoured inclusion, though small and not statistically significant, heterogeneity was present in all analyses, and there was inconsistency in direction and magnitude of the effect sizes. This finding is similar to the results of previous meta\u2010analyses, which include studies published before 2000, and thus although the number of studies in the current meta\u2010analyses is limited, it can be concluded that it is very unlikely that inclusion in general increases or decreases learning and psychosocial adjustment in children with special needs. Future research should explore the effects of different kinds of inclusive education for children with different kinds of special needs, to expand the knowledge base on what works for whom.", "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-12-01", "synthetic_support_claim": "Inclusion likely does not significantly affect academic achievement or psychosocial adjustment in children with SEN.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Inclusion improves academic achievement and socio-emotional development for all students with special educational needs."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "dac173ddf663789d9d7074c2c6c33040b0c04853", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dac173ddf663789d9d7074c2c6c33040b0c04853", "title": "Trends Of \"Inclusive Education\" In The Modern World: International Discussions And Prospects For Russia", "abstract": "The article examines the trends in the development of the concept of \"inclusive education\" in the documents of international organizations, discussions in academic publications regarding this concept, its evolution and implementation.

of interpersonal relations of students with disabilities in the student group on the level of their readiness for future professional activity. The results of the empirical research, the purpose of which was to reveal the peculiarities of interrelation between readiness for professional activity and sociometric status of future specialists in adaptive physical culture with disabilities, are presented. The main group consisted of 64 students with impaired functions of the locomotor apparatus, hearing, vision and speech. All respondents of the main group underwent professional training in different courses of study in 29 student study groups. The comparison group was 516 conditionally healthy students studying together with the students of the main group. The study was carried out using the sociometric survey method, as well as T. Leary's technique aimed at identifying the predominant type of interaction in the group, and T.D. Dubovitskaya and A.V. Krylov's technique, which allows measuring the adaptability of students in the university. Readiness for professional activity was studied by means of expert assessment of the level of theoretical and practical preparedness of students as future trainers-teachers in adaptive physical culture. It was revealed that students with disabilities have in general a significantly lower sociometric status than conditionally healthy students. At the same time, sociometric status is largely conditioned by the number of students with disabilities in the student group, as well as by their peculiarities of interpersonal interaction. It is revealed that the level of theoretical and practical training of students with disabilities has a positive correlation with their sociometric status, level of adaptation to the study group and negative - with sociometric antipathy, tendency to aggressive and egocentric interaction. It is concluded that interpersonal relations in inclusive student groups are an important factor in the professional training of students with disabilities.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2025-01-20", "synthetic_support_claim": "Interpersonal relations in inclusive student groups are crucial for the professional training of students with disabilities.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Students with disabilities perform better academically in segregated groups than in inclusive student groups."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "768403710ec37fe612257384b19bf8f1c7bcce72", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/768403710ec37fe612257384b19bf8f1c7bcce72", "title": "Formative assessment strategies for students' conceptions - The potential of learning analytics", "abstract": "Formative assessment is considered to be helpful in students' learning support and teaching design.

However, recent developments in CD mostly concentrate on improving the accuracy of diagnostic results and often overlook the important and practical task: domain-level zero-shot cognitive diagnosis (DZCD). The primary challenge of DZCD is the deficiency of student behavior data in the target domain due to the absence of student-exercise interactions or unavailability of exercising records for training purposes. To tackle the cold-start issue, we propose a two-stage solution named TechCD (Transferable knowledgE Concept grapH embedding framework for Cognitive Diagnosis). The fundamental notion involves utilizing a pedagogical knowledge concept graph (KCG) as a mediator to connect disparate domains, allowing the transmission of student cognitive signals from established domains to the zero-shot cold-start domain. Specifically, a naive yet effective graph convolutional network (GCN) with the bottom-layer discarding operation is initially employed over the KCG to learn transferable student cognitive states and domain-specific exercise traits. Moreover, we give three implementations of the general TechCD framework following the typical cognitive diagnosis solutions.

The primary challenges lie in identifying implicit collaborative connections and disentangling the entangled cognitive factors of learners for improved explainability and controllability in learner Cognitive Diagnosis (CD). However, there has been no work on CD capable of simultaneously modeling collaborative and disentangled cognitive states.

Specifically, Coral first introduces a disentangled state encoder to achieve the initial disentanglement of learners' states. Subsequently, a meticulously designed collaborative representation learning procedure captures collaborative signals. It dynamically constructs a collaborative graph of learners by iteratively searching for optimal neighbors in a context-aware manner. Using the constructed graph, collaborative information is extracted through node representation learning. Finally, a decoding process aligns the initial cognitive states and collaborative states, achieving co-disentanglement with practice performance reconstructions.

However, these purposes have not always been achieved so, over time, limitations to the way that practical work has been developed have also been identified. In order to recognize the current state of the art on the development of the practical work in the teaching of sciences, a systematic literature review was designed, especially focused on the definition of the concept of practical work, its advantages, evaluation methodologies, and the criticism/limitations attributed to its implementation.

Analysis of this corpus allowed the identification of 8 categories associated to the concept of practical work, 5 categories associated to its advantages, 6 categories with the types/methodologies of evaluation and 5 categories associated with the limitations of this methodology. (From this analysis) it is concluded that most authors considers that the main idea integrative idea of the concept of practical work should be the manipulation of materials in practical activities (hands-on style), and the main advantage of this methodology comes from the fusion between the development of practical skills and the conceptual understanding (minds-on).

Each section is summarised with key clinical practice points. The recommendations made are based on a comprehensive review of the published evidence, where available and pertinent, but are predominantly based on expert opinion aimed at providing useful pragmatic guidance. Learning disability is the preferred term used in the UK to refer to individuals who have \u2018significantly reduced ability to understand new or complex information, to learn new skills\u2019 and a \u2018reduced ability to cope independently which starts before adulthood with lasting effects on development\u2019. Individuals with learning disability represent a widely heterogeneous group of people and can be associated with a broad range of primary diagnoses and comorbidities. There is no definitive record of the number of people with learning disability in England. However, Public Health England (PHE) estimates that in 2015 the population was 1 087 100, including 930 400 adults (approximating 2% of the adult population). The estimated prevalence of learning disability in children and young people (CYP) is 2.5%. Far fewer individuals with learning disability were recorded in health and welfare systems. For example, only 324 291 children and adults were identified as having learning disability on general practitioner (GP) practicebased registers in 2021. It is likely that those registered have a more severe learning disability or more commonly associated conditions, for example, Down syndrome. This is important, as it means that many individuals with learning disability do not have their diagnosis recognised within health and welfare systems potentially increasing their vulnerability through lack of access to regular health reviews and other relevant public health programmes, for example, vaccination programmes. A series of measures have been introduced by the National Health Service (NHS) to help improve the identification of people with learning disability. The life expectancy of people with learning disability is reduced compared with the general population; only 37% of adults with learning disability live beyond 65 years of age compared with 85% of the general population. Pneumonia is the most common cause of death among adults with learning disability and is also a common cause of death in CYP with learning disability, with bacterial pneumonia accounting for a significant proportion of these (adults 24%, children 21%). A further 16% of adult and 3% of paediatric deaths in the learning disability population are caused by aspiration pneumonia (AP). CAP is a major contributor to the increased hospitalisation risk that has been described for people with learning disability and results in longer hospital stays than the general population. People with learning disability also experience increased rates of repeated admission secondary to CAP. As CAP is a major cause of death in people with learning disability, prevention, early detection and proactive management are key to reducing mortality from avoidable causes. It is important that public sector organisations make reasonable adjustments in their approach or provision to ensure that people with learning disability have equitable access to good quality healthcare. 10", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-02-01", "synthetic_support_claim": "Pneumonia is the most common cause of death among adults with learning disability.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "\"There is a direct genetic cause for community-acquired pneumonia in individuals with learning disability.\""}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "b97df01c03402b2fcfacc9ec6398f340389aeeae", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b97df01c03402b2fcfacc9ec6398f340389aeeae", "title": "Lung imaging methods: indications, strengths and limitations", "abstract": "Imaging methods are fundamental tools to detect and diagnose lung diseases, monitor their treatment and detect possible complications.

The general critical care cohort included 6224 admissions in 4976 patients. The standardised mortality rate in people with learning disabilities admitted to critical care was 0.59 compared to the general critical care cohort which was 0.98. Mortality outcomes remained better in patients with learning disabilities compared to the general critical care cohort in invasively ventilated patients and in people with profound and multiple learning disability. Critical care length of stay was longer in people with learning disabilities. 12\u2009month mortality was 14.8% in the learning disability cohort. By the end of the study, 23.9% of people with learning disabilities had died after a mean of 482\u2009days following their first critical care admission. Patients who are currently still alive after having survived to hospital discharge following critical care admission have lived an average of 1129\u2009days. After only 7.4% of critical care admissions in people with learning disabilities was there an increase in dependence on assistance in activities of daily living.\n\n\nDiscussion\nWe have shown that people with learning disabilities are more likely to survive following a critical care admission than general critical care patients. This is regardless of whether they were invasively ventilated or whether they had profound and multiple learning disabilities. Critical care admission and invasive ventilation are associated with good short and longer term mortality.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-12-02", "synthetic_support_claim": "People with learning disabilities are more likely to survive following critical care admission than others.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "People with learning disabilities receive the same length of critical care stay as the general population."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "08f785f5af169df7f1eaa6a5a827bfa68eec8881", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/08f785f5af169df7f1eaa6a5a827bfa68eec8881", "title": "ChatGPT in the Classroom: An Analysis of Its Strengths and Weaknesses for Solving Undergraduate Computer Science Questions", "abstract": "This research paper aims to analyze the strengths and weaknesses associated with the utilization of ChatGPT as an educational tool in the context of undergraduate computer science education.

They have created an urgent need for educators to rethink pedagogical approaches and teaching strategies for newly emerging skill sets. Traditional approaches to learning programming have focused on frequent and repeated practice at writing code. The ease with which code can now be generated has resulted in a shift in focus towards reading, understanding and evaluating LLM-generated code. In parallel with this shift, a new essential skill is emerging -- the ability to construct good prompts for code-generating models. This paper introduces a novel pedagogical concept known as a `Prompt Problem', designed to help students learn how to craft effective prompts for LLMs. A Prompt Problem challenges a student to create a natural language prompt that leads an LLM to produce the correct code for a specific problem. To support the delivery of Prompt Problems at scale, in this paper we also present a novel tool called Promptly which hosts a repository of Prompt Problems and automates the evaluation of prompt-generated code. We report empirical findings from a field study in which Promptly was deployed in a first-year Python programming course (n=54). We explore student interactions with the tool and their perceptions of the Prompt Problem concept.

However, the challenge of effectively integrating sustainability into university practices and student behavior remains significant. The Ecological Footprint, subjective well-being, and academic performance are three critical dimensions that, when evaluated together, offer a comprehensive view of sustainability in the educational context. This study aims to apply a university sustainability assessment model called \u2019Sunshine\u2019 to university students in a diverse sample of five different countries. Additionally, the study provides a critical analysis of the relationships among the indicators of Ecological Footprint, Happiness, and Academic Performance. This application seeks to test the robustness of the model and explore lifestyle differences among students, providing valuable insights for decision-making in the context of university sustainability. Data were collected through specific questionnaires administered to a representative sample of students, and analyses were conducted using descriptive and inferential statistical techniques. The results show that Brazilian, American, and Peruvian students exhibit an unsustainable lifestyle, requiring more than one planet to support their consumption habits. However, they are considered happy and perform well academically. These students were classified as environmentally distracted, highlighting a disconnect between their environmental awareness and practices. Chinese students showed a high ecological footprint, contrasting with the Italian group, which had an ecological footprint below one planet. However, both groups presented similar results, with low happiness indices and high academic performance. On the other hand, the group of Mexican students was the most sustainable, achieving acceptable levels in all three sustainability indicators. The analyses revealed that academic performance is related to happiness in some groups but not happiness in Ecological Footprint.

One significant challenge is the financial burdens of pursuing a career in medicine. Specifically the application process for residency away rotations can be financially costly, and these rotations have become increasingly vital for medical students to match into competitive specialties. Because of these financial obstacles, residency programs have implemented visiting student diversity scholarships to alleviate this financial burden and foster diversity in orthopedic surgery. The aim of this investigation was to provide a comprehensive review and centralized source of information for the growing number of student diversity scholarships for away rotations in orthopedic surgery. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of ERAS-participating orthopedic surgery programs (n=203) from the 2023/2024 application cycle. The study utilized residency and program web domains to collect information on the monetary value of the scholarship, number of scholarships being offered, eligibility criteria, and required application documents. This study found that approximately 34% (n=67) of programs offer a scholarship for URiM visiting medical students. The average number of scholarships offered per program was 5 \u00b1 4.6 with an average value per scholarship of $1,856.6 \u00b1 $706.6. Most programs defined eligibility of URiM status in a statement similar to that of the AAMCs. Low socioeconomic status was accounted for in 8 (11.9%) programs. Most programs (90%) catered only to 4th-year medical students, 15 required USMLE Step 1 scores, and 16 required letters of recommendation.

To provide a more welcoming environment, identifying where applicants experience discrimination along medical training must be of paramount concern. Our objective was to understand the challenges faced by SGM medical students applying into orthopaedic surgery. Methods: An anonymous survey was sent to applicants of a single orthopaedic residency program in 2023, soliciting demographics, exposure to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or queer (LGBTQ) mentors, and experiences with discrimination. Data were stratified by sexual orientation, and univariate analysis was conducted using chi-squared tests. Afterward, logistic regressions adjusted for gender, age, and race were performed. Results: The overall response rate was 15.4% (n = 136/881). Fifteen percent (n = 20/135) identified as LGBTQ. Sixty-one percent of LGBTQ-identifying applicants experienced slurs and/or hurtful comments during orthopaedic rotations and research experiences, compared with 28% of their heterosexual peers (p < 0.001).

To address this, we introduce CodeXEmbed, a family of large-scale code embedding models ranging from 400M to 7B parameters. Our novel training pipeline unifies multiple programming languages and transforms various code-related tasks into a common retrieval framework, enhancing model generalizability and retrieval performance. Our 7B model sets a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) in code retrieval, outperforming the previous leading model, Voyage-Code, by over 20% on CoIR benchmark. In addition to excelling in code retrieval, our models demonstrate competitive performance on the widely adopted BeIR text retrieval benchmark, offering versatility across domains. Experimental results demonstrate that improving retrieval performance significantly enhances end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) performance for code-related tasks.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-11-19", "synthetic_support_claim": "Our 7B model sets a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) in code retrieval on CoIR benchmark.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "CodeXEmbed models improve the performance of developers' productivity tools by 50% across all programming languages."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "73b5b51d825a744611e782447f27dc0846069e0c", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/73b5b51d825a744611e782447f27dc0846069e0c", "title": "Understanding the LLM-ification of CHI: Unpacking the Impact of LLMs at CHI through a Systematic Literature Review", "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have been positioned to revolutionize HCI, by reshaping not only the interfaces, design patterns, and sociotechnical systems that we study, but also the research practices we use.

Therefore, this concept research was done, and one of the most important reasons is \"a significant change in all the ways we educate.\" This research is a development of the concept of the seven stages of maturity level inside a University, which is the basis for developing the next idea, namely the new average University, which consists of eight stages.

The results of this study are the framework and the maturity level of University Profiling 2.0, which will become the basis for implementing gamification, board games, and metaverse in universities.

The epistemic emotion identification task is a fine-grained identification task that contains multiple categories of emotions arising during the learning process. Previous studies only consider emotional or semantic information within the review texts alone, which leads to insufficient feature representation. In addition, some categories of epistemic emotions are ambiguously distributed in feature space, making them hard to be distinguished. In this article, we present an emotion-semantic-aware dual contrastive learning (ES-DCL) approach to tackle these issues. In order to learn sufficient feature representation, implicit semantic features and human-interpretable emotional features are, respectively, extracted from two different views to form complementary emotional-semantic features. On this basis, by leveraging the experience of domain experts and the input emotional-semantic features, two types of contrastive losses (label contrastive loss and feature contrastive loss) are formulated. They are designed to train the discriminative distribution of emotional-semantic features in the sample space and to solve the anisotropy problem between different categories of epistemic emotions. The proposed ES-DCL is compared with 11 other baseline models on four different disciplinary MOOCs review datasets.

Traditional approaches focus on developing a single global model based on a combined dataset collected from different locations. However, wireless signals are known to be location and environment specific. Thus, a global model results in inconsistent and unreliable sensing results. It is also unrealistic to construct individual models for all the possible locations and environmental scenarios. Motivated by the observation that signals recorded at different locations are closely related to a set of physical-layer semantic features, in this paper we propose SANSee, a semantic-aware networking-based framework for distributed wireless sensing. SANSee allows models constructed in one or a limited number of locations to be transferred to new locations without requiring any locally labeled data or model training. SANSee is built on the concept of physical-layer semantic-aware network (pSAN), which characterizes the semantic similarity and the correlations of sensed data across different locations. A pSAN-based zero-shot transfer learning solution is introduced to allow receivers in new locations to obtain location-specific models by directly aggregating the models trained by other receivers. We theoretically prove that models obtained by SANSee can approach the locally optimal models.

However, this student-led learning can be challenging to achieve in a classroom limited by a one-to-many teacher-led instruction. We, thus, have designed and prototyped a generative artificial intelligence chatbot application (GAIA), named TeacherGAIA, that can be used to asynchronously support students in their self-directed learning and self-assessment outside the classroom. We first identified diverse constructivist learning approaches that align with, and promote, student-led learning. These included knowledge construction, inquiry-based learning, self-assessment, and peer teaching. The in-context learning abilities of large language model (LLM) from OpenAI were then leveraged via prompt engineering to steer interactions supporting these different learning approaches. These interactions contrasted with ChatGPT, OpenAI\u2019s chatbot which by default engaged in the traditional transmissionist mode of learning reminiscent of teacher-led instruction. Preliminary design, prompt engineering and prototyping suggested fidelity to the learning approaches, cognitive guidance, and social-emotional support, all of which were implemented in a generative AI manner without pre-specified rules or \u201chard-coding\u201d.

HE is vital for equipping individuals with essential knowledge and skills for socio-economic transformation. However, in Africa, this role has weakened, with industry assuming a leading position. Curricula in HE institutions are slow to adapt to the skills needed by industries, leading to a range of challenges such as outdated curriculum delivery, desertion of technical and vocational training, inadequate research resources, insufficient collaboration frameworks between HE and industries, minimal support for entrepreneurship, and poor infrastructure. Aligning HE curricula with industry skills requirements is crucial for enhancing African economic development and competitiveness. Unfortunately, there is a notable lack of partnerships and practical mechanisms for curriculum integration among African HE institutions, which results in graduates possessing skills that do not meet industry demands. This paper reviews the extensive literature on HE's role in African economies, advocating for in-depth collaboration between HE and industry in order to tackle skills mismatches. Accordingly, establishing a healthy partnership between HE institutions and industries could facilitate work-integrated learning, encourage industry-led curriculum development, and prepare graduates with applicable skills and relevant knowledge for the job market.

By analyzing data from 451 valid questionnaires through structural equation modeling (SEM) and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) methods, several key findings emerged.

A holistic view of wellbeing, which encompasses both physical and mental health, underscores their interconnected nature. This integrated approach reduces the artificial separation of wellbeing facets, and highlights how mental states influence not only individuals, but also their interactions with animals, the environment, and others in the workplace. Wellbeing challenges in veterinary medicine may contribute to negative impacts in animal, human, and environmental health. Veterinary education institutions and systems are also experiencing complex challenges as they adapt to rapidly changing societal, workforce, and professional wellbeing related pressures. This review paper explores the field of positive psychology and its application in educational contexts, commonly known as positive education. A thorough exploration of the systems-informed positive education approach and ways in which it can proactively enhance veterinary professional wellbeing from within the veterinary education ecosystem are presented. It is important to recognize that individual self-care, while valuable, cannot compensate for systemic dysfunctions such as poor team dynamics, ineffective leadership, or organizational culture issues. Addressing these systemic factors is critical for creating environments that support sustained flourishing. Positive psychology interventions delivered through the pathways of individuals, groups, and organizations specifically within a veterinary education context are discussed. Limitations, considerations, and proposed measurement strategies are reviewed. The implications of implementing a systems-informed positive psychology approach to enhance wellbeing in veterinary education include creating curriculum and cultures that enable flourishing within veterinary education institutions.

By its nature self-formation is never complete and its incidence is uneven among students, with some of them scarcely experiencing it.

To provide a comprehensive viewpoint, the direct impact of entrepreneurial attitude (EA) on entrepreneurial intention has also been looked at. This study, has adopted existing scales to measure entrepreneurial intention, entrepreneurial attitude, and entrepreneurial self-efficacy. For experiential learning, a structured scale has been designed on the basis of its existing scales. Data were collected from 669 students, enrolled in entrepreneurial courses/programs. Punjab, Haryana, and National capital region (NCR) are the three Indian regions considered for the survey. The results highlight that there is a positive influence of experiential learning on entrepreneurial intention though \u03b2-value is low (0.042). While the \u03b2-value with mediation influence of entrepreneurial self-efficacy between experiential learning and entrepreneurial intention was 0.090 (0.697*0.130), which states that entrepreneurial self-efficacy mediates and enhances the relationship between experiential learning and entrepreneurial intention. It was also found that there is a direct and strong influence of entrepreneurial attitude on entrepreneurial intention (\u03b2-value, 0.872). Thus, there is a need to focus on entrepreneurial attitude, as it strongly influences the intentions of the students. Overall results have a bearing that experiential learning; entrepreneurial self-efficacy and entrepreneurial attitude emerged as important predictors of entrepreneurial intention and explained 89.6% of variations in the model. Moreover, experiential learning with the mediation of entrepreneurial self-efficacy had more impact on entrepreneurial intention.

Materials and methods We designed a series of 11 online clinical anatomy revision sessions advertised to all undergraduate medical students at a UK university. Five of these sessions were randomised to include interactive questions asked using an ARS (Mentimeter), and the remainder included interactive questions asked using videoconferencing (Microsoft Teams) functionality only. Data on attendance and engagement were collected, and attendees were asked to complete an end-of-session survey and an end-of-session test of knowledge. Results On average, significantly more attendees engaged with each interactive question asked using Mentimeter compared to questions asked without (30.1% vs 6.4%; p=2.20\u00d710-16).

The use of information technology can help spread knowledge more widely. This is known as e-learning. The teachers and students can benefit from having current information and knowledge. The goal of this study was to investigate the variables that influence the adoption of e-learning at the selected secondary schools in the Khomas region, Namibia where computer studies is taught in grade 8. \n \nA mixed method approach was used for the study. Random sampling was used to select the quantitative phase and purposive sampling was used for the qualitative phase. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect quantitative data from the learners, and semi-structured interviews were conducted to gather qualitative data from the teachers.

Prior to the pandemic, depression and anxiety were already on the rise among college students, but the changes associated with it may have exacerbated these issues. Our study aimed to explore factors influencing college students\u2019 mental health and identify common trends in their experiences that could assist organizations and policymakers in the future. Methods The study participants (n = 571) were chosen using a convenience sample of undergraduate and graduate students attending a Central Texas university. We employed the Qualtrics survey platform to collect data on multiple demographic variables, behavioral health, and other health outcomes of students in the summer semester of 2021. Our objective in this study was to investigate the various factors that contribute to mental health conditions, particularly anxiety, and depression, independently and jointly, by employing two validated tools - Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), which measures depression, and General Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7), which measures anxiety. Results Both the tools displayed satisfactory internal consistency, with Cronbach\u2019s alpha coefficients (\u03b1) of 0.921 for the PHQ-9 (9-item) scale and 0.943 for the GAD-7 (7-item) scale. The prevalence of depression and anxiety among participants was 39.4% and 40.1%, respectively, with 31% of participants overall reporting both conditions. Among the explored factors, age, race, parent/guardian\u2019s level of education, campus residence status, and health insurance status were associated with depression (p < 0.05), whereas gender, age, race, and parent/guardian\u2019s level of education were associated with anxiety (p < 0.05). Academically, several factors related to learning difficulties (i.e., staying motivated to learn, finding a quiet place to learn) were associated with the severity of depression and anxiety severity, demonstrated through composite scores.

The participants were 398 Romanian university students from nine different faculties. The factor structure of the scale was assessed using Exploratory Factor Analysis (Principal Axis Factoring extraction method) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis. The high goodness-of-fit indices validated a second-order factor model of mental health problems, with two distinct but correlated sub-constructs, psychological distress, and online academic difficulties, integrated under a single higher-level factor. Psychological distress comprises indicators such as anxiety and stress, while online academic difficulties contain, for instance, indicators such as decreased performance, fatigue or lack of motivation. The results of applying multiple assessment criteria showed good reliability (e.g., McDonald\u2019s omega), as well as convergent validity (e.g., Average Variance Extracted) and discriminant validity (e.g., the heterotrait\u2013monotrait ratio of correlations) of the scale. Also, correlations analysis between mental health problems occurred in online learning context and other measures indicated a strong negative relation with online course satisfaction and weak negative relations with subjective academic performance, perceived social competence, and perceived digital competence. In conclusion, the scale appears to be a valid instrument for measuring some negative mental health outcomes in online learning, perceived by university students. The implications of the results and limitations of this study are also discussed. In conclusion, the scale has multiple possible applications, the most important being (1) the assessment of mental health problems both in ordinary online learning situations and in emergency ones, which would allow the early detection of these issues, (2) the possibility of assessing relations between the sub-constructs of the scale and other psychological constructs of interest in scientific research, and (3) the feedback for teaching staff involved in the online learning system.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-12-30", "synthetic_support_claim": "A valid instrument was developed to measure negative mental health outcomes in online learning for students.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Increased screen time directly causes deterioration in mental health for university students in online learning."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "847f1521e42c6c9d925e6238f23c5a93c3327ab4", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/847f1521e42c6c9d925e6238f23c5a93c3327ab4", "title": "Learning in the Digital Age Full of Hedonistic Cultural Values Among Elementary School Students", "abstract": "The era of digital development that dominates the world with the sophistication of today's internet networks, especially the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, has created a learning system using mobile phones with internet networks.

The article argues that there is potential for Gen-AI to offer major benefits to existing approaches to media education and that the technology could in fact drive greater interest in studying the creative arts. The act of creativity is valued by those who practise it for intrinsic purposes, and many graduates of screen programmes have traditionally leveraged their passion and creative conceptual understandings in a wide variety of employment fields outside vocationally-oriented screen production roles.

An autonomic cycle of data analysis tasks is a set of data analysis tasks that supervise and control a process anonymously, which are based on knowledge models (of prediction, recognition, etc.), interacting with each other to reach a common goal. Each task has a different function in the cycle: observation of the process, or its analysis, or decision-making.FindingsThis work presents the autonomic cycle. With its components, this autonomic cycle detects sound information using a taxonomic model of the sound events to analyze them and give a recommendation about the context. The taxonomic model is a hierarchical pattern that considers different aspects to recognize the sound events. This work defines the architecture of this autonomic cycle, specifies its machine-learning-based analysis tasks and evaluates its capabilities of reasoning, adaptation and communication in case studies.Research limitations/implicationsIt is important to work in the future on the improvement of the accuracy of the system by implementing neural networks or more sophisticated techniques. To take the implemented autonomic cycle to a higher level, it could use parallel function management. The automation also needs improvement.

This study aims to identify the needs of students and teachers in developing a digital teaching module based on Bedhaya Ketawang. The study employed a mixed-method approach, gathering quantitative data through a survey distributed to 87 students, alongside qualitative data collected through interviews and observations with two arts and culture teachers. Research instruments included questionnaires, interview guidelines, and learning observation tools. The data were descriptively analyzed using simple statistical and interactive qualitative analyses. The findings show that while students understand the local culture, their practical engagement remains limited. A total of 80% of students reported that more interactive digital media would enhance their learning process, and 83% expressed a desire for increased use of digital media in arts and cultural education. Interviews and observations revealed that current digital media are passive and suboptimal for promoting student engagement.

No similar surveys have been conducted in Western Australia (WA) and it is not known how medical students in WA feel about the use of AI in healthcare or their understanding of AI. We aim to assess WA medical students\u2019 attitudes towards AI in general, AI in healthcare, and the inclusion of AI education in the medical curriculum. Methods A digital survey instrument was developed based on a review of available literature and consultation with subject matter experts. The survey was piloted with a group of medical students and refined based on their feedback. We then sent this anonymous digital survey to all medical students in WA (approximately 1539 students). Responses were open from the 7th of September 2021 to the 7th of November 2021. Students\u2019 categorical responses were qualitatively analysed, and free text comments from the survey were qualitatively analysed using open coding techniques. Results Overall, 134 students answered one or more questions (8.9% response rate). The majority of students (82.0%) were 20\u201329 years old, studying medicine as a postgraduate degree (77.6%), and had started clinical rotations (62.7%). Students were interested in AI (82.6%), self-reported having a basic understanding of AI (84.8%), but few agreed that they had an understanding of the basic computational principles of AI (33.3%) or the limitations of AI (46.2%). Most students (87.5%) had not received teaching in AI. The majority of students (58.6%) agreed that AI should be part of medical training and most (72.7%) wanted more teaching focusing on AI in medicine. Medical students appeared optimistic regarding the role of AI in medicine, with most (74.4%) agreeing with the statement that AI will improve medicine in general. The majority (56.6%) of medical students were not concerned about the impact of AI on their job security as a doctor. Students selected radiology (72.6%), pathology (58.2%), and medical administration (44.8%) as the specialties most likely to be impacted by AI, and psychiatry (61.2%), palliative care (48.5%), and obstetrics and gynaecology (41.0%) as the specialties least likely to be impacted by AI. Qualitative analysis of free text comments identified the use of AI as a tool, and that doctors will not be replaced as common themes. Conclusion Medical students in WA appear to be interested in AI. However, they have not received education about AI and do not feel they understand its basic computational principles or limitations.

Advancements in AI technology have the potential to revolutionize health care, from aiding in the diagnosis of certain diseases to helping with treatment decisions. Current literature suggests the integration of the subject of AI in medicine as part of the medical curriculum to prepare medical students for the opportunities and challenges related to the use of the technology within the clinical context. Objective We aimed to explore the relevant knowledge and understanding of the subject of AI in medicine and specify curricula teaching content within medical education. Methods For this research, we conducted 12 guideline-based expert interviews. Experts were defined as individuals who have been engaged in full-time academic research, development, or teaching in the field of AI in medicine for at least 5 years. As part of the data analysis, we recorded, transcribed, and analyzed the interviews using qualitative content analysis. We used the software QCAmap and inductive category formation to analyze the data. Results The qualitative content analysis led to the formation of three main categories (\u201cKnowledge,\u201d \u201cInterpretation,\u201d and \u201cApplication\u201d) with a total of 9 associated subcategories. The experts interviewed cited knowledge and an understanding of the fundamentals of AI, statistics, ethics, and privacy and regulation as necessary basic knowledge that should be part of medical education. The analysis also showed that medical students need to be able to interpret as well as critically reflect on the results provided by AI, taking into account the associated risks and data basis. To enable the application of AI in medicine, medical education should promote the acquisition of practical skills, including the need for basic technological skills, as well as the development of confidence in the technology and one\u2019s related competencies. Conclusions The analyzed expert interviews\u2019 results suggest that medical curricula should include the topic of AI in medicine to develop the knowledge, understanding, and confidence needed to use AI in the clinical context.

Data were collected over a 12-month classroom ethnography, including lesson recordings, stimulated recalls, and reflexive journals. A thematic analysis of the data reveals that transnational teachers and students actively employed translanguaging to challenge the prevailing hegemony of Western thinking and knowing in the EMI environment.

The main objective of this review is to analyze the influence of stress and emotions (as part of stress) on the learning environment. Stress is a physiological mechanism that the organism develops to adapt and survive external and internal challenges. In this context, stress tends to be seen as a negative condition in the learning process when it is chronic. Extreme stress situations, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, can generate anxiety and frustration in students. However, other studies indicate that controlled stress can positively enhance the learning process. On the other hand, the quality and intensity of emotions resulting from stress can influence as well the learning process. Positive emotions are healthy and can promote optimal learning. Emotions lead to sentimental, cognitive, behavioral, and physiological changes, which will have a strong influence on intellectual performance. The activation of coping strategies constitutes a key mechanism for dealing positively with problems and challenges, generating positive emotions essential for the self-regulation of learning.

Stress coping strategies are expected to enhance students' performance during OSCE. The objective was to determine the effect of short preventive coping interventions on performance of medical students.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nDouble-blinded, randomized controlled trial with multiple arms and a superiority hypothesis. Enrolment was proposed to each fourth-year undergraduate medical student convened to the Lyon Est University OSCE in 2022. There was no exclusion criterion. Students were randomized to one of four groups: standardized breathing with cardiac biofeedback (BFB), mindfulness-based intervention (MBI), positive psychology intervention (PPI), or control (CTRL). Each intervention was video-guided, lasted six minutes, and occurred just before starting the OSCE. The primary outcome was the academic OSCE score, assessed through specific grids by university examiners blinded to the interventions. Secondary outcomes included specific performance scores, and student perception of the influence of the intervention on their performance.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 482 students were included. No difference was found between BFB (-0.17 [95%CI, -1.20 to 0.86], p\u2009=\u2009.749), MBI (0.32 [95%CI, -0.71 to 1.36], p\u2009=\u2009.540), or PPI groups (-0.25 [95%CI, -1.29 to 0.79], p\u2009=\u2009.637) on the academic OSCE score compared to the control group, nor regarding the specific performance scores. Compared to the control group, the students perceived that the intervention influenced more positively their performance (BFB +3 [95%CI, 0-8]), p\u2009<\u2009.001; MBI +4 [95%CI, 1-9], p\u2009=\u2009.040; PPI +1 [95%CI, 0-4], p\u2009=\u2009.040]).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nA single six-minute cardiac biofeedback, mindfulness, or positive psychology intervention performed by fourth-year medical students just before an OSCE did not improve their following academic performance. Still, students reported that the interventions helped them to enhance their performance.

The findings of this study are intended to provide valuable insights for the development and implementation of effective health education programs aimed at tuberculosis prevention and control. Methods A convenient sampling method was employed to conduct a questionnaire-based survey among college students at a university in Hainan Province using the Wenjuanxing platform from January to February 2023. The survey evaluated students\u2019 general information and their knowledge, attitude, and practice regarding tuberculosis prevention and control. The scores of correct knowledge, attitude, and practice were compared based on students\u2019 demographic characteristics. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to determine the influencing factors of students\u2019 knowledge, attitude, and practice related to tuberculosis prevention and control. Results A total of 280 questionnaires were distributed, of which 265 valid responses were collected, resulting in a valid response rate of 94.6%. The study found that medical students exhibited higher levels of correct knowledge, attitude, and practice compared to non-medical students (5.92 vs. 5.17, 3.17 vs. 2.57, 3.48 vs. 2.78, respectively). Moreover, students who had received tuberculosis education had higher correct scores compared to those who had not (5.92 vs. 5.31, 3.08 vs. 2.65, 3.31 vs. 2.93, respectively). Additionally, students in higher grades demonstrated higher scores in attitude.

This type of care is different for patients with COVID-19 compared with other patients. This study aims to explain the experiences of intensive care unit (ICU) nurses in providing end-of-life care to patients with COVID-19. Design Qualitative content analysis. Setting The study population consisted of ICU nurses working in hospitals affiliated with the Kerman University of Medical Sciences in southeastern Iran. Participants 14 ICU nurses, including 9\u2009women and 5 men, participated in this study. Their mean age was 33.79\u00b15.07 years, and their mean work experience was 8.64\u00b13.5 years. Primary and secondary objectives The purpose of this qualitative content analysis was to explore the experiences of Iranian intensive care nurses using purposive sampling and semistructured in-depth interviews. Sampling was based on maximum variation (age, gender, professional experience and educational level) to obtain rich information. Guba and Lincoln\u2019s criteria were applied to increase the trustworthiness and rigour of the study, and the data were analysed using Graneheim and Lundman\u2019s method and MAXQDA 2020.

This research was conducted at SMA Negeri 1 Ratahan, and the sample is the first-year students, which was made up of 35 students. The instruments used in collecting data are observation techniques. The data were analyzed qualitatively. 1) The concept of purpose was present in Meetings 2, 3, 4, and 5. It is shown that when students reason, they reason to achieve some objective, to satisfy some desire, or to fulfill some need. 2) The concept of \"question\" was in Meetings 1, 2, 4, and 5. This shows that generally, the students had questions and problems to be solved. (3) The concept of concept was only observed in Meetings 2, 3, and 5. Some ideas or concepts are used in all reasoning but not others. 4) The concept of assumption was in Meetings 1, 2, 4, and 5. All reasoning must begin somewhere; we must take some things for granted. Any \"defect\" in the assumptions or presuppositions with which the reasoning begins is a possible source of problems for students. 5) Only at Meeting 5 was the concept of information discussed. Whenever we reason, there is some \"stuff,\" some phenomenon, about which we are reasoning. Any \"defect,\" then, in the experiences, data, evidence, or raw material upon which a person\u2019s reasoning is based is a possible source of problems. 6) The concept of interpretation was discussed in Meetings 3 and 4. Reasoning proceeds in steps: \"Because this is so, that also is so (or probably so),\" or \"Since this, therefore that.\" Any \"defect\" in such inferences is a possible problem in our reasoning. 7) In Meetings 3 and 5, the concept of point of view or frame of reference was discussed. In this case, students reason within certain frames of reference. Any \"defect\" in that point of view or frame of reference is a possible source of problems in the reasoning. 8) Only Meetings 3 and 4 discussed the concept of implications (and consequences).

Method This qualitative study conducted semi-structured interviews with 24 international students from a British university to explore their experiences during the transition. The results were analysed using thematic analysis. Results Our data revealed both internal and external challenges to students during the online-to-offline shift, which lead to a general resistance to said shift. Specifically, policy challenges (e.g., policy conflicts) imposed the most significant impacts on international students, resulting in psychological anxiety, financial losses, and negative learning experiences. The reduction of digital tools and learning materials during the shift also presented challenges to students who developed a reliance on digital resources while learning remotely.

The data analysis technique is descriptive statistical analysis and inferential statistical analysis with product moment correlation techniques. \nMain Findings: The research results based on descriptive statistical analysis show that independence in learning is in the low category with an average value of 88.56 and the peer group is in the medium category with an average value of 87. Meanwhile, the results of inferential statistical analysis show that rcount is greater than rtable or 0.27 \u2265 0.24, H0 is rejected and H1 is accepted, meaning that there is a relationship between the peer group and the learning independence of students. Where is the sig value. 2-tailed is 0.00 \u2264 0.05. \nNovelty/Originality of this study: This research contributes to explaining the social aspects of independent learning that are often overlooked in previous literature. While much research has explored internal factors that influence learning independence, the emphasis on the role of peer groups as external agents influencing students' motivation, mindset, and learning styles, is an innovative focus point. This enriches our insight into how social interaction with fellow students can have a significant influence on the level of learning independence of Biology Education students.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-10-26", "synthetic_support_claim": "There is a positive relationship between peer groups and learning independence in Biology Education students.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Peer groups significantly improve the academic performance of biology education students."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "2924b4e6b2c65baa7e51157884f6d613c82a3f91", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2924b4e6b2c65baa7e51157884f6d613c82a3f91", "title": "Effective Strategy: Talking Stick Cooperative Learning to Improve Understanding of Chemical Bonding", "abstract": "Purpose of the study: This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of implementing the Talking Stick Cooperative Learning Model in improving the learning outcomes of Class X2 students at Rangsang 1 State Senior High School, located in Rangsang District, Meranti Islands Regency, on the topic of Chemical Bonds. \nMethodology: This study is a Classroom Action Research.

With the increasing reliance on social media, understanding how these behaviors shape preferences for physical social environments is crucial for designing supportive campus spaces. This study investigates the relationship between social anxiety, social media usage, and environmental preferences in campus settings. We aim to identify the key environmental factors that can promote healthier social interactions for students with varying levels of social anxiety and social media use. Data were collected from university students through a structured questionnaire assessing demographic characteristics, online and offline behavior, social media usage intensity, social anxiety level, and environmental preferences. Using K-means clustering, participants were grouped into four clusters based on their social media usage and social anxiety levels. ANOVA and Multivariate Multiple Regression (MMR) were conducted to examine differences in environmental preferences across these clusters. Significant differences in environmental preferences were observed across the four clusters. Gender and grade influenced social anxiety levels, with females and undergraduate students reporting greater anxiety. Individuals with high social media use, regardless of their anxiety levels, generally exhibited stronger preferences for various environmental dimensions, including openness, convenience, facility provision, safety/comfort, and cultural landscape. However, individuals with higher social anxiety tended to prefer enclosed, facility-rich, and more controlled environments. The relationship between social anxiety and preferences for convenience, safety/comfort, and cultural landscape was minimal or non-significant.

This study investigates the relationship between entrepreneurial intention in the Malaysian mushroom industry and the moderating effect of government support, drawing insights from the interplay between entrepreneurial self-efficacy, intention, and external support mechanisms. Numerous factors influence entrepreneurship intentions in the mushroom industry. Entrepreneurial self-efficacy plays a crucial role in shaping entrepreneurial intentions and behaviors, and individuals with high self-efficacy are more likely to perceive themselves as capable of successfully starting and running a new business. Government support can provide funding, tax advantages, subsidies, skills development, and advice services and create enabling environments for entrepreneurial efforts. The literature on government support and its impact on entrepreneurship intention reveals gaps that need further exploration. The theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) offers a comprehensive framework for understanding how entrepreneurship education influences self-efficacy, attitudes, and intentions. This study examines the capacity of government assistance to impact entrepreneurial intention in the Malaysian mushroom business, providing vital knowledge on how to promote a more robust environment for sustainable mushroom production.

Digital literacy is now considered a foundational skill and an integral requirement for lifelong learning, and includes the ability to search efficiently, critique information and recognise the inherent risk of bias in information sources. However, at many universities, digital literacy is assumed. In part, this can be linked to the concept of the Digital Native, a term first coined in 2001 by the US author Marc Prensky to describe young people born after 1980 who have been surrounded by mobile phones, computers, and other digital devices their entire lives. The objective of this paper is to explore the concept of the Digital Native and how it influences undergraduate nursing education. Materials and Methods: A pragmatic approach was used for this narrative review, working forward from Prensky\u2019s definition of the Digital Native and backward from contemporary sources of information extracted from published health, education and nursing literature. Results: The findings from this narrative review will inform further understanding of digital literacy beliefs and how these beliefs influence undergraduate nursing education. Recommendations for enhancing the digital literacy of undergraduate nursing students are also discussed. Conclusions: Digital literacy is an essential requirement for undergraduate nursing students and nurses and is linked with safe, evidence-based patient care. The myth of the Digital Native negates the reality that exposure to digital technologies does not equate digital literacy and has resulted in deficits in nursing education programs.

However, changes are required to improve the capabilities of health managers in driving successful digital transformation. Objective This paper aims to explore the organizational barriers that health service managers have encountered when realizing the benefits of a digitally transforming environment. This is part of a larger research study exploring digital competencies for health service managers, with the findings from focus group discussions providing a baseline from which to address the organizational improvements and changes in system capabilities required to assist in realizing the benefits of digital health transformation. Methods The study is qualitative in nature. It employs focus group discussions to gain an in-depth understanding of the experiences and views of health service managers and identify the benefits and barriers that managers have experienced in introducing digital health in their workplace. Results Barriers encountered in realizing digital health benefits in the workplace were evidenced across five major themes: (1) change resistance and usage, (2) trust and uniformity, (3) resourcing and procurement, (4) digital literacy, and (5) siloed systems. Discussion Findings from this study demonstrate that in driving the realization of digital health transformation benefits, health service managers need organizational and system-wide efforts to support managing in the digital health context. The key identified barriers experienced by health service managers include facing human and technical challenges with system adoption and the governance of data-driven decision-making in the digital context. Conclusion The importance of digital transformation in healthcare is evident and will increasingly become a necessity for organizational survival and success. This study adds important insights into the organizational barriers that health service managers have encountered when realizing the benefits resulting from digital transformation. Addressing these barriers requires macro-, meso- and micro-level system investments. These benefits are enhanced by enabling factors critical for digital health adoption that have been described in key categories involving health system related: (1) policy and system, (2) organizational structure and processes, and human resource management, and (3) people factors.

These models, including Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT)-3.5 (OpenAI), GPT-4 (OpenAI), and Bard (Google LLC), find applications beyond natural language processing, attracting interest from academia and industry. Students are actively leveraging LLMs to enhance learning experiences and prepare for high-stakes exams, such as the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) in India. Objective This comparative analysis aims to evaluate the performance of GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Bard in answering NEET-2023 questions. Methods In this paper, we evaluated the performance of the 3 mainstream LLMs, namely GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Google Bard, in answering questions related to the NEET-2023 exam. The questions of the NEET were provided to these artificial intelligence models, and the responses were recorded and compared against the correct answers from the official answer key. Consensus was used to evaluate the performance of all 3 models. Results It was evident that GPT-4 passed the entrance test with flying colors (300/700, 42.9%), showcasing exceptional performance. On the other hand, GPT-3.5 managed to meet the qualifying criteria, but with a substantially lower score (145/700, 20.7%). However, Bard (115/700, 16.4%) failed to meet the qualifying criteria and did not pass the test. GPT-4 demonstrated consistent superiority over Bard and GPT-3.5 in all 3 subjects. Specifically, GPT-4 achieved accuracy rates of 73% (29/40) in physics, 44% (16/36) in chemistry, and 51% (50/99) in biology. Conversely, GPT-3.5 attained an accuracy rate of 45% (18/40) in physics, 33% (13/26) in chemistry, and 34% (34/99) in biology. The accuracy consensus metric showed that the matching responses between GPT-4 and Bard, as well as GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, had higher incidences of being correct, at 0.56 and 0.57, respectively, compared to the matching responses between Bard and GPT-3.5, which stood at 0.42. When all 3 models were considered together, their matching responses reached the highest accuracy consensus of 0.59. Conclusions The study\u2019s findings provide valuable insights into the performance of GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Bard in answering NEET-2023 questions. GPT-4 emerged as the most accurate model, highlighting its potential for educational applications. Cross-checking responses across models may result in confusion as the compared models (as duos or a trio) tend to agree on only a little over half of the correct responses. Using GPT-4 as one of the compared models will result in higher accuracy consensus. The results underscore the suitability of LLMs for high-stakes exams and their positive impact on education. Additionally, the study establishes a benchmark for evaluating and enhancing LLMs\u2019 performance in educational tasks, promoting responsible and informed use of these models in diverse learning environments.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-08-02", "synthetic_support_claim": "GPT-4 consistently outperforms GPT-3.5 and Bard in answering NEET-2023 exam questions.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "GPT-4's performance in the NEET-2023 exam guarantees student's success who use it for preparation."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "e1b4ae3e939dc3024390292d45ff0c6e50089c2b", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e1b4ae3e939dc3024390292d45ff0c6e50089c2b", "title": "Evaluation of a Large Language Model on the American Academy of Pediatrics' PREP Emergency Medicine Question Bank.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nLarge language models (LLMs), including ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pretrained Transformer), a popular, publicly available LLM, represent an important innovation in the application of artificial intelligence. These systems generate relevant content by identifying patterns in large text datasets based on user input across various topics. We sought to evaluate the performance of ChatGPT in practice test questions designed to assess knowledge competency for pediatric emergency medicine (PEM).\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe evaluated the performance of ChatGPT for PEM board certification using a popular question bank used for board certification in PEM published between 2022 and 2024. Clinicians assessed performance of ChatGPT by inputting prompts and recording the software's responses, asking each question over 3 separate iterations. We calculated correct answer percentages (defined as correct in at least 2/3 iterations) and assessed for agreement between the iterations using Fleiss' \u03ba.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe included 215 questions over the 3 study years. ChatGPT responded correctly to 161 of PREP EM questions over 3 years (74.5%; 95% confidence interval, 68.5%-80.5%), which was similar within each study year (75.0%, 71.8%, and 77.8% for study years 2022, 2023, and 2024, respectively).

The previous mode of teaching has been replaced by remote education, the effectiveness of which depends, among other things, on the technological infrastructure of universities and the digital competence of lecturers and students. The main objective of this study is to evaluate remote learning in higher education from the students\u2019 point of view. The uniqueness of the present research approach lies in the identification of four dimensions (socio-emotional, developmental, time-financial, and negative attitude) of students\u2019 evaluation of remote learning in higher education. The survey was conducted on 999 students studying remotely, including 518 women and 481 men. Most of the students surveyed had been studying remotely for 1\u20132 years and were studying full-time for their first degree. The research tool consisted of 16 mixed survey questions. Six of them were related to sociodemographic factors (including those related to the respondents\u2019 education), and eight were related to their experiences with and opinions about remote education, respectively. The remaining two questions were used to collect respondents\u2019 evaluations of the degree of importance to them of various advantages and disadvantages of remote education. The research showed that among the advantages of remote learning for students, the most important are saving time, the possibility of studying at a university far from home (another city, another country), the possibility of combining work and study, and reduced commuting costs. On the other hand, the disadvantages of remote learning of greatest importance to students include the loss of social ties due to lack of contact with peers, feelings of fatigue resulting from excessive use of information and communication tools, and greater susceptibility to various forms of distraction. In addition, the shape of students\u2019 education was relevant to the different dimensions of their evaluation of remote learning in higher education. The social-emotional size of remote learning is more important for students who study remotely in a blended mode (compared to uniform). The developmental dimension is essential for students who participate in remote learning activities for longer during the day. In addition, a more extended period of remote learning promotes the greater importance of the time-financial dimension when evaluating remote knowledge.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-11-01", "synthetic_support_claim": "Identification of four unique dimensions (socio-emotional, developmental, time-financial, negative attitude) in students\u2019 remote learning evaluation.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Remote learning significantly improves academic performance and understanding compared to traditional in-person education methods."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "f9aa397472f16e26c94367268392830f14f3d003", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f9aa397472f16e26c94367268392830f14f3d003", "title": "Amid and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic: Internet costs for remote work by university lecturers in Tanzania\u2014who does the cap fit?", "abstract": "The global COVID-19 pandemic has greatly dis\u00adrupted education worldwide, including in Sub-Saharan Af\u00adrica, which was caught off guard.

However, the magnitude of this relationship and its moderating factors remain unclear. Objective This study aims to systematically examine the relationship between parental technoference and child problematic media use, as well as to identify moderating factors such as age, parental technoference group, study design, and type of problematic media use. Methods Following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, a comprehensive literature search was conducted up to August 2024 across multiple databases, including Web of Science, EBSCO, ProQuest, PubMed, PsycINFO, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure, using predefined search strings. A total of 53 studies with a total of 60,555 participants (mean age of 13.84, SD 1.18 years) were included. Inclusion criteria comprised studies involving children under the age of 22 years, assessing the association between parental technoference and child problematic media use with valid measures, and reporting necessary statistical data. Exclusion criteria included studies focusing on other child outcomes, having sample sizes <30, or being case reports or review papers. The risk of bias was assessed using the Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed using R (version 4.2.1; R Foundation for Statistical Computing) with the meta and metafor packages to evaluate the association and conduct moderator analyses. Results The meta-analysis identified a significant positive association between parental technoference and child problematic media use (r=0.296, 95% CI 0.259-0.331). Moderator analyses revealed that both parental technoference group (P<.001) and study design (P=.008) significantly influenced this relationship. Specifically, the association was stronger when both parents engaged in technoference compared to when only 1 parent did, and in cross-sectional studies compared to longitudinal studies. Age, gender, publication status, and type of problematic media use did not significantly moderate the relationship (all P>.05). Conclusions This meta-analysis provides robust evidence of the association between parental technoference and child problematic media use. The findings highlight the need for family-based interventions and underscore the importance of longitudinal research to understand the temporal dynamics of this relationship better.

Methods: A large corpus of essays was rated using standard criteria by a large number of human experts (teachers). We augment the analysis with a consideration of the linguistic characteristics of the generated essays. Results: Our results demonstrate that ChatGPT generates essays that are rated higher for quality than human-written essays. The writing style of the AI models exhibits linguistic characteristics that are different from those of the human-written essays, e.g., it is characterized by fewer discourse and epistemic markers, but more nominalizations and greater lexical diversity. Conclusions: Our results clearly demonstrate that models like ChatGPT outperform humans in generating argumentative essays.

Recently, certain efforts have been made to improve the diagnosis precision, by designing deep neural networks-based diagnostic functions or incorporating more rich context features to enhance the representation of students and exercises. However, how to interpretably infer the student's mastery over non-interactive knowledge concepts (i.e., knowledge concepts not related to his/her exercising records) still remains challenging, especially when not giving relations between knowledge concepts. To this end, we propose a Knowledge-Sensed Cognitive Diagnosis (KSCD) framework, aiming at learning intrinsic relations among knowledge concepts from student response logs and incorporating them for inferring students' mastery over all knowledge concepts in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, we firstly project students, exercises and knowledge concepts into embedding representation matrices, where the intrinsic relations among knowledge concepts are reflected in the knowledge embedding representation matrix. Then, the knowledge-sensed student knowledge mastery vector and exercise factor vectors are obtained by the multiply product of their embedding representations and the knowledge embedding representation matrix, which make the student's mastery of non-interactive knowledge concepts be interpretably inferred. Finally, we can utilize classical student-exercise interaction functions to predict student's exercising performance and jointly train the model. In additional, we also design a new function to better model the student-exercise interactions.

Besides, lower-order exercise latent representations obtained in shallow layers are not well explored when learning the student representation. To tackle the issues, this paper suggests a meta multigraph-assisted disentangled graph learning framework for CD (DisenGCD), which learns three types of representations on three disentangled graphs: student-exercise-concept interaction, exercise-concept relation, and concept dependency graphs, respectively. Specifically, the latter two graphs are first disentangled from the interaction graph. Then, the student representation is learned from the interaction graph by a devised meta multigraph learning module; multiple learnable propagation paths in this module enable current student latent representation to access lower-order exercise latent representations, which can lead to more effective nad robust student representations learned; the exercise and concept representations are learned on the relation and dependency graphs by graph attention modules. Finally, a novel diagnostic function is devised to handle three disentangled representations for prediction. Experiments show better performance and robustness of DisenGCD than state-of-the-art CD methods and demonstrate the effectiveness of the disentangled learning framework and meta multigraph module.

Relevant literature encompasses issues of plagiarism and academic dishonesty, as well as pedagogy and educational affordances; yet, no real-life implementation of ChatGPT in the educational process has been reported to our knowledge so far. Objective This mixed methods study aimed to evaluate the implementation of ChatGPT in the educational process, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Methods In March 2023, a total of 77 second-year dental students of the European University Cyprus were divided into 2 groups and asked to compose a learning assignment on \u201cRadiation Biology and Radiation Protection in the Dental Office,\u201d working collaboratively in small subgroups, as part of the educational semester program of the Dentomaxillofacial Radiology module. Careful planning ensured a seamless integration of ChatGPT, addressing potential challenges. One group searched the internet for scientific resources to perform the task and the other group used ChatGPT for this purpose. Both groups developed a PowerPoint (Microsoft Corp) presentation based on their research and presented it in class. The ChatGPT group students additionally registered all interactions with the language model during the prompting process and evaluated the final outcome; they also answered an open-ended evaluation questionnaire, including questions on their learning experience. Finally, all students undertook a knowledge examination on the topic, and the grades between the 2 groups were compared statistically, whereas the free-text comments of the questionnaires were thematically analyzed. Results Out of the 77 students, 39 were assigned to the ChatGPT group and 38 to the literature research group. Seventy students undertook the multiple choice question knowledge examination, and examination grades ranged from 5 to 10 on the 0-10 grading scale. The Mann-Whitney U test showed that students of the ChatGPT group performed significantly better (P=.045) than students of the literature research group. The evaluation questionnaires revealed the benefits (human-like interface, immediate response, and wide knowledge base), the limitations (need for rephrasing the prompts to get a relevant answer, general content, false citations, and incapability to provide images or videos), and the prospects (in education, clinical practice, continuing education, and research) of ChatGPT. Conclusions Students using ChatGPT for their learning assignments performed significantly better in the knowledge examination than their fellow students who used the literature research methodology. Students adapted quickly to the technological environment of the language model, recognized its opportunities and limitations, and used it creatively and efficiently. Implications for practice: the study underscores the adaptability of students to technological innovations including ChatGPT and its potential to enhance educational outcomes.

However, there is a lack of studies on ChatGPT's effectiveness in handling dental tasks. This study aimed to compare the knowledge and comprehension abilities of ChatGPT-3.5/4 with that of dental students about periodontal surgery.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nA total of 134 dental students participated in this study. We designed a questionnaire consisting of four questions about the inclination for ChatGPT, 25 multiple-choice, and one open-ended question. As the comparison of ChatGPT-3.5 and 4, the question about the inclination was removed, and the rest was the same. The response time of ChatGPT-3.5 and 4 as well as the comparison of ChatGPT-3.5 and 4' performances with dental students were measured. Regarding students' feedback on the open-ended question, we also compared the outcomes of ChatGPT-4' and teacher's review.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOn average, ChatGPT-3.5 and 4 required 3.63\u2009\u00b1\u20091.18\u2009s (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.14, 4.11) and 12.49\u2009\u00b1\u20097.29\u2009s (95% CI, 9.48, 15.50), respectively (p\u2009<\u20090.001) for each multiple-choice question.

We found out that capstone courses generally last one semester and divide students into groups of 4-5 where they work on a project for a client. For a slight majority of courses, the clients are external to the course staff and students are often expected to produce a proof-of-concept level software product as the main end deliverable. The courses also offer versatile assessments for students throughout the project. This paper provides researchers and educators with a classification of characteristics of software engineering capstone courses based on previous research.

While research has shown that physical exercise may be associated with reduced academic burnout, the underlying mechanisms require further exploration. This study explored the relationship between physical exercise and academic burnout in a sample of college students, with a focus on the serial mediating roles of self-efficacy and resilience. Methods This study adopted a cross-sectional survey approach among a sample of undergraduate college students in China. We recruited 1,270 participants in the second half of the 2021\u20132022 academic year (476 men and 794 women), all of whom completed questionnaires containing the Physical Activity Rating Scale, Academic Burnout Scale for College Students, 10-item General Self-Efficacy Scale, and 25-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale. We then subjected the collected data to a series of statistical analyses. Results and conclusion Physical exercise was significantly and negatively associated with academic burnout and its three subfactors (i.e., emotional exhaustion, improper behavior, and low personal achievement). Participants in the high physical exercise group showed lower levels of academic burnout than those in the moderate and low physical exercise groups. Finally, our serial mediation model showed that physical exercise had a significant direct effect on academic burnout (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009\u22120.1104, 95% CI\u2009=\u2009[\u22120.1421, \u22120.0791]) in addition to significant indirect effects on academic burnout via self-efficacy and resilience (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009\u22120.0802, 95% CI\u2009=\u2009[\u22120.1088, \u22120.0527]); the more exercise participation, the lower the academic burnout among college students.

During the \u201cHygiene and Public Health\u201d course for fifth-year medical students, a practical training session was conducted on vaccination using AI chatbots as an educational supportive tool. Before receiving specific training on vaccination, the students were given a web-based test extracted from the Italian National Medical Residency Test. After completing the test, a critical correction of each question was performed assisted by AI chatbots. Objective The main aim of this study was to identify whether AI chatbots can be considered educational support tools for training in public health. The secondary objective was to assess the performance of different AI chatbots on complex multiple-choice medical questions in the Italian language. Methods A test composed of 15 multiple-choice questions on vaccination was extracted from the Italian National Medical Residency Test using targeted keywords and administered to medical students via Google Forms and to different AI chatbot models (Bing Chat, ChatGPT, Chatsonic, Google Bard, and YouChat). The correction of the test was conducted in the classroom, focusing on the critical evaluation of the explanations provided by the chatbot. A Mann-Whitney U test was conducted to compare the performances of medical students and AI chatbots. Student feedback was collected anonymously at the end of the training experience. Results In total, 36 medical students and 5 AI chatbot models completed the test. The students achieved an average score of 8.22 (SD 2.65) out of 15, while the AI chatbots scored an average of 12.22 (SD 2.77). The results indicated a statistically significant difference in performance between the 2 groups (U=49.5, P<.001), with a large effect size (r=0.69). When divided by question type (direct, scenario-based, and negative), significant differences were observed in direct (P<.001) and scenario-based (P<.001) questions, but not in negative questions (P=.48). The students reported a high level of satisfaction (7.9/10) with the educational experience, expressing a strong desire to repeat the experience (7.6/10). Conclusions This study demonstrated the efficacy of AI chatbots in answering complex medical questions related to vaccination and providing valuable educational support.

Medical students, as early adopters of technology and future health care providers, play a crucial role in shaping the future of health care. However, little is known about the utilization of, perceptions on, and intention to use AI chatbots among medical students in China. Objective This study aims to explore the utilization of, perceptions on, and intention to use generative AI chatbots among medical students in China, using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) framework. By conducting a national cross-sectional survey, we sought to identify the key determinants that influence medical students\u2019 acceptance of AI chatbots, thereby providing a basis for enhancing their integration into medical education. Understanding these factors is crucial for educators, policy makers, and technology developers to design and implement effective AI-driven educational tools that align with the needs and expectations of future health care professionals. Methods A web-based electronic survey questionnaire was developed and distributed via social media to medical students across the country. The UTAUT was used as a theoretical framework to design the questionnaire and analyze the data. The relationship between behavioral intention to use AI chatbots and UTAUT predictors was examined using multivariable regression. Results A total of 693 participants were from 57 universities covering 21 provinces or municipalities in China. Only a minority (199/693, 28.72%) reported using AI chatbots for studying, with ChatGPT (129/693, 18.61%) being the most commonly used. Most of the participants used AI chatbots for quickly obtaining medical information and knowledge (631/693, 91.05%) and increasing learning efficiency (594/693, 85.71%). Utilization behavior, social influence, facilitating conditions, perceived risk, and personal innovativeness showed significant positive associations with the behavioral intention to use AI chatbots (all P values were <.05).

In a typical flipped class model, work that is typically done as homework in the didactic model is interactively undertaken in the class with the guidance of the teacher, whereas listening to a lecture or watching course\u2010related videos is undertaken at home. The essence of a flipped classroom is that the activities carried out during traditional class time and self\u2010study time are reversed or \u2018flipped\u2019. Objectives The primary objectives of this review were to assess the effectiveness of the flipped classroom intervention for undergraduate health professional students on their academic performance, and their course satisfaction. Search Methods We identified relevant studies by searching MEDLINE (Ovid), APA PsycINFO, Education Resources Information Center (ERIC) as well as several more electronic databases, registries, search engines, websites, and online directories. The last search update was performed in April 2022. Selection Criteria Included studies had to meet the following criteria: Participants: Undergraduate health professional students, regardless of the type of healthcare streams (e.g., medicine, pharmacy), duration of the learning activity, or the country of study. Intervention: We included any educational intervention that included the flipped classroom as a teaching and learning tool in undergraduate programs, regardless of the type of healthcare streams (e.g., medicine, pharmacy). We also included studies that aimed to improve student learning and/or student satisfaction if they included the flipped classroom for undergraduate students. We excluded studies on standard lectures and subsequent tutorial formats. We also excluded studies on flipped classroom methods, which did not belong to the health professional education(HPE) sector (e.g., engineering, economics). Outcomes: The included studies used primary outcomes such as academic performance as judged by final examination grades/scores or other formal assessment methods at the immediate post\u2010test, as well as student satisfaction with the method of learning. Study design: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi\u2010experimental studies (QES), and two\u2010group comparison designs. Although we had planned to include cluster\u2010level RCTs, natural experiments, and regression discontinuity designs, these were not available. We did not include qualitative research. Data Collection and Analysis Two members of the review team independently screened the search results to assess articles for their eligibility for inclusion. The screening involved an initial screening of the title and abstracts, and subsequently, the full text of selected articles. Discrepancies between the two investigators were settled through discussion or consultation with a third author. Two members of the review team then extracted the descriptions and data from the included studies. Main Results We found 5873 potentially relevant records, of which we screened 118 of them in full text, and included 45 studies (11 RCTs, 19 QES, and 15 two\u2010group observational studies) that met the inclusion criteria. Some studies assessed more than one outcome. We included 44 studies on academic performance and eight studies on students' satisfaction outcomes in the meta\u2010analysis. The main reasons for excluding studies were that they had not implemented a flipped class approach or the participants were not undergraduate students in health professional education. A total of 8426 undergraduate students were included in 45 studies that were identified for this analysis. The majority of the studies were conducted by students from medical schools (53.3%, 24/45), nursing schools (17.8%, 8/45), pharmacy schools (15.6%, 7/45). medical, nursing, and dentistry schools (2.2%, 1/45), and other health professional education programs (11.1%, 5/45). Among these 45 studies identified, 16 (35.6%) were conducted in the United States, six studies in China, four studies in Taiwan, three in India, two studies each in Australia and Canada, followed by nine single studies from Brazil, German, Iran, Norway, South Korea, Spain, the United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey. Based on overall average effect sizes, there was better academic performance in the flipped class method of learning compared to traditional class learning (standardised mean difference [SMD]\u2009=\u20090.57, 95% confidence interval [CI]\u2009=\u20090.25 to 0.90, \u03c4 2: 1.16; I 2: 98%; p\u2009<\u20090.00001, 44 studies, n\u2009=\u20097813). In a sensitivity analysis that excluded eleven studies with imputed data from the original analysis of 44 studies, academic performance in the flipped class method of learning was better than traditional class learning (SMD\u2009=\u20090.54, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.24 to 0.85, \u03c4 2: 0.76; I 2: 97%; p\u2009<\u20090.00001, 33 studies, n\u2009=\u20095924); all being low certainty of evidence. Overall, student satisfaction with flipped class learning was positive compared to traditional class learning (SMD\u2009=\u20090.48, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.15 to 0.82, \u03c4 2: 0.19, I 2:89%, p\u2009<\u20090.00001, 8 studies n\u2009=\u20091696); all being low certainty of evidence. Authors' Conclusions In this review, we aimed to find evidence of the flipped classroom intervention's effectiveness for undergraduate health professional students. We found only a few RCTs, and the risk of bias in the included non\u2010randomised studies was high. Overall, implementing flipped classes may improve academic performance, and may support student satisfaction in undergraduate health professional programs. However, the certainty of evidence was low for both academic performance and students' satisfaction with the flipped method of learning compared to the traditional class learning. Future well\u2010designed sufficiently powered RCTs with low risk of bias that report according to the CONSORT guidelines are needed.", "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-07-07", "synthetic_support_claim": "Implementing flipped classes may improve academic performance and support student satisfaction in health programs.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "The flipped classroom approach consistently improves long-term retention of material better than traditional classroom methods."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "49f5e6c05ebf5a0e52990825c481c9dc1d9ac2b8", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/49f5e6c05ebf5a0e52990825c481c9dc1d9ac2b8", "title": "Designing a Needs-Based Flipped-TPACK Model for Animal Husbandry English", "abstract": "This study aims to design a Flipped-TPACK model tailored to the English for Specific Purposes (ESP) needs of Animal Husbandry students at Universitas Muhammadiyah Parepare based on a comprehensive needs analysis.

However, limited evidence exists regarding the readiness of health science students, particularly in northern Saudi Arabia (KSA), to integrate AI into their future practices, highlighting the need for focused evaluation. We evaluated northern Saudi health science students\u2019 knowledge, attitude, practice, and associated factors toward AI. Participants and Methods The present cross-sectional study was conducted among 384 health science students aged 18 years and above from Jouf University, KSA. The study employed a validated data collection form with four sections: demographics, knowledge (AI principles and applications), attitudes (perceptions and ethical concerns), and practices (usage and confidence in AI tools). The three domains\u2019 scores were categorized as low (<60%), medium (60\u201380%) and high (>80%) based on their total scores. We utilized Spearman correlation test to ascertain the strength and direction of correlation among each subscale. Additionally, multivariate analysis was employed to identify associated factors. Results The present study demonstrated low knowledge, attitude, and practices among 55.7%, 37.0%, and 50.3% of health science students. We observed a positive correlation between knowledge and attitude (rho = 0.451, p = 0.001), knowledge and practice (rho = 0.353, p = 0.001), and attitude and practice (rho = 0.651, p = 0.001). Knowledge (p = 0.001) and practice (p = 0.002) were significantly higher among the students who participated in a formal AI training program.

We assessed participants\u2019 willingness to protect (WTP) and the perceived attractiveness of both plants and their pollinators.

Conversely, plants were consistently perceived as more attractive than pollinators, irrespective of whether the flowers were displayed alone or alongside pollinators. The perceived attractiveness of both plants and pollinators was significantly correlated with WTP. Notably, colourful pollinators such as Selasphorus rufus, Vestiaria coccinea, and Danaus plexippus positively influenced WTP plants, while the remaining five species (predominantly invertebrates) did not exhibit a similar effect.

We develop a novel distillation scheme that can address these limitations and close the gap between the sensorimotor agent and its privileged teacher. Our key insight is to design a student which learns to align their input features with the teacher's privileged Bird's Eye View (BEV) space.

We evaluated METDrive on the CARLA leaderboard's Longest6 benchmark, achieving a driving score of 70%, a route completion score of 94%, and an infraction score of 0.78.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-09-19", "synthetic_support_claim": "METDrive achieves a driving score of 70%, route completion score of 94%, and infraction score of 0.78.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "METDrive significantly outperforms all other existing end-to-end autonomous driving systems in every benchmark test."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "004ae8c31beb1a2d87dfbab5d4be464078e51803", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/004ae8c31beb1a2d87dfbab5d4be464078e51803", "title": "A Camera-Based End-to-End Autonomous Driving Framework Combined With Meta-Based Multi-Task Optimization", "abstract": "Most existing autonomous driving pipelines can be divided into two broad categories: those based on a modular framework, which can result in error transmission, and those based on an end-to-end framework, which lack interpretability. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel vision-based multi-task framework that incorporates motion planning, bird\u2019s eye view (BEV) map generation, BEV object prediction, depth estimation, semantic segmentation, and velocity prediction. In particular, we present an improved view transformation module that transforms feature maps into BEV space and predicts future waypoints in BEV space. The multi-task framework can improve performance by sharing information across tasks, and the results of the multi-tasks also improve interpretability. In addition, to address the negative transfer, we introduce intertask affinity, which provides a rough estimate of the relationship between tasks. Moreover, because these relationships may change during training, we use a meta-based multi-task optimization method to dynamically adjust multi-task weighting. We evaluate the performance of our proposed model using the Longest6 and Town05 Long benchmarks of the CARLA simulator. Our model outperforms the current state-of-the-art camera-based models and achieves competitive results with other multimodal methods on both the benchmarks.

The relevance of this topic arises from the unprecedented stressors affecting academic members in higher education institutions, who face both personal and professional challenges. A cross-sectional analytical design was employed, using an online survey distributed among 429 academic staff members. The findings reveal that nearly half of the respondents frequently contemplate changing careers, highlighting substantial job instability. Accessible mental health support is associated with a 6% decrease in career change intentions, while a supportive institutional culture further reduces these intentions by 8-9%. Notably, self-help practices emerged as the most effective support mechanism, associated with a 12% reduction in career change intentions. These findings suggest that institutions can improve retention by prioritizing and promoting accessible self-help initiatives. The study underscores the importance of structured mental health support in fostering resilience within the academic community, with implications for policy and practice in war-affected educational environments.\nAcknowledgmentThe research teams acknowledge the Armed Forces of Ukraine for providing safety during their research and credit their perseverance and courage for making this possible.

Previous research has demonstrated the dysfunctional norms and conflicting ideologies that create identity struggle, disproportionally affecting women and individuals underrepresented in medicine. Symbolic interactionism can help explain identity struggles, emphasizing the influence of socio-contextual factors on identity construction. The purpose of this study was to explore how residents navigate identity struggles during residency training. Method: We conducted a qualitative exploration of 12 residents in three specialties at three academic institutions in the United States. Participants engaged in rich picture drawings followed by one-on-one interviews. We coded transcript data and met regularly to identify themes related to residents\u2019 experiences with navigating professional identity struggles. Results: We identified three main themes on navigating identity struggles: the weight of identity work, the isolating nature of identity work, and the navigation that occurs with and against socio-contextual currents. Residents described identity work as navigation like a boat at sea. This work felt weighty and at times overwhelming and residents often felt unable to discuss their identity struggles with others. Residents utilized what agency they had to either navigate with the current, navigating towards acceptable\u2014albeit imperfect\u2014paths forward, or attempting to go against the current to forge new paths through resistance. Discussion: This study highlights how context enables and constrains identity construction, how contextual constraints can create dissonance between identities, and the considerable effort required to reconcile dissonance and construct professional identities. Training program adjustments, enhanced resident support, and cultural shifts are required to sustain residents\u2019 identity work. Medical professionals should engage in collective identity work to reimagine the profession\u2019s identity by addressing dysfunctional cultural norms.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-11-11", "synthetic_support_claim": "Residents experience identity work in residency training as navigating like a boat at sea.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Structured mentorship programs effectively alleviate identity struggles experienced by medical residents during their training."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "fb41107ba3e16879ba3f40f1033e90f58d7ccbf9", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fb41107ba3e16879ba3f40f1033e90f58d7ccbf9", "title": "When Personal Identity Meets Professional Identity: A Qualitative Study of Professional Identity Formation of International Medical Graduate Resident Physicians in the United States", "abstract": "International medical graduates (IMGs) account for 25% of the physician workforce in the United States, yet little is known about their professional identity formation (PIF).

Method: Using a social constructivist approach, the researchers conducted semi-structured individual interviews with 15 IMG resident physicians in the United States. The authors analyzed the data using a constant comparison approach and identified themes by consensus. Results: Participants described their PIF journey beginning before starting residencies in the US. Their PIF was challenging due to structural barriers associated with their immigrant status. Furthermore, participants reported more difficulties with PIF if they did not look white. When their pre-existing professional and personal identities clashed with the American professional norm, the residents suppressed or compartmentalized these pre-existing identities. However, participants also reported that their diverse personal identities could be assets to the provision of care for diverse patient populations.

Key findings reveal a generally positive perception among the teacher educators, who recognize GenAI\u2019s potential to support academic achievement, increase student engagement, and improve communication within teacher education settings. The findings further indicate that the teacher educators\u2019 background factors, such as age, years of teaching experience, department, and college, do not significantly predict their perceptions of GenAI. Since none of these measured background factors were significant predictors, this suggests that training and resources for using GenAI should be broadly prioritized, accessible, and not heavily tailored to specific demographic groups. However, the study identified significant concerns within the barriers and challenges factors, including ethical issues, fairness in student assessment, and possible adverse effects on the teacher educator-student relationship. The communication and independence factors highlight a need for professional development, with teacher educators emphasizing the importance of training in GenAI usage to optimize its educational potential. The study concludes that while teacher educators generally support GenAI\u2019s potential benefits, there are essential ethical and practical challenges to address.

Objective The present study aimed to determine the prevalence and variables influencing depression, anxiety, and stress in Chilean university students. Method A representative sample (n\u2009=\u20091,062) of Chilean university students and a cross-sectional study design were used. Bivariate analysis and multiple logistic regression were performed to identify risk factors associated with symptomatology. They were analyzed using descriptive statistics. A questionnaire with sociodemographic variables was applied in November 2022, in addition to the depression anxiety stress scale (DASS-21), instruments with excellent reliability in this population (\u03b1\u2009=\u20090.955; \u03c9\u2009=\u20090.956). On the other hand, the Questionnaire of Problematic Alcohol and Drug Consumption (DEP-ADO) was applied. A descriptive analysis was performed, followed by bivariate analysis and multiple logistic regression using SPSS version 25. The variables showed a value of p <0.05; they were declared statistically significant in the final model. Odds ratios (OR) were adjusted to a 95% confidence interval (95% CI), which was used to determine the independent predictors. Results The prevalence of mental health problems in this population was high, with depressive symptoms in 63.1% of the sample; 69.2% with anxiety; 57% with stress; 27.4% with problematic alcohol consumption; and 14.9% with inappropriate marijuana consumption. Some 10.1% of the sample reported daily medication with antidepressants and/or anxiolytics. Concerning significant variables for depression, these were: being female, belonging to sexual, not having children, having problematic marijuana use, and using prescription drugs. Concerning anxiety, the significant variables were being a woman, belonging to sexual minorities, being an adolescent, and consuming prescription medication. Finally, concerning stress, the significant variables were being a woman, belonging to sexual minorities, being a student dedicated exclusively to academic activities, and taking prescription medication. Conclusion Chilean university students presented a high prevalence of anxiety, depression, and stress, where being female and belonging to sexual minorities seem to be the variables that have the greatest impact on susceptibility to mental health problems.

The objective of the present study was to investigate the association between mental health (i.e., anxiety, depression symptoms and stress), QOL, SWLS and lifestyle parameters (i.e., PA, sleep duration, ST and food habits) among Chilean university students and then to determine the differences in mental health, QOL, SWLS and lifestyle parameters according to gender. Methods: This cross-sectional study included a total of 211 university students (128 females and 83 males) aged 18\u201328 years. Mental health, QOL and lifestyle were measured through validated questionnaires. Results: Bad food habits (lowest score in the food survey) were linked to anxiety (2.3 [0.22\u20134.36], p = 0.03), depressive symptoms (3.75 [1.54\u20135.9], p = 0.001) and stress (2.24 [0.31\u20134.17], p = 0.023).

This study aims to investigate the association between physical exercise and achievement motivation, while also examining the mediating roles played by self-efficacy and life satisfaction. Methods This study employed a cross-sectional survey methodology, with a sample of 900 Chinese university students as the research participants. A total of 844 valid questionnaires were collected and analyzed. The participants completed various scales, including measures of sports activity level, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, and achievement motivation. Subsequently, comprehensive descriptive statistical analyses were conducted on the gathered data. Results and conclusion A significant positive correlation is present between physical exercise and achievement motivation (r\u202f=\u202f0.464, p\u202f<\u202f0.01), self-efficacy (r\u202f=\u202f0.288, p\u202f<\u202f0.01), and life satisfaction (r\u202f=\u202f0.333, p\u202f<\u202f0.01) among college students. Moreover, achievement motivation demonstrates a positive association with self-efficacy (r\u202f=\u202f0.506, p\u202f<\u202f0.01) and life satisfaction (r\u202f=\u202f0.399, p\u202f<\u202f0.01). Furthermore, the relationship between physical exercise and achievement motivation can be influenced by both self-efficacy and life satisfaction as mediators in our constructed mediation model where the total effect is 0.512 with direct effect of 0.348 and indirect effect of 0.163. The results of the constructed mediating effect model demonstrate that self-efficacy and life satisfaction serve as significant mediators and moderators, effectively enhancing the achievement motivation levels of college students.

They can also clarify the distinction between the predictors and outcomes of SBO.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis systematic review follows PRISMA guidelines and aims to synthesize knowledge about the development of SBO and its predictors and outcomes. We queried databases for articles published between January 2002 and February 2021 that use a quantitative assessment of SBO and have longitudinal designs using students in secondary education.\n\n\nRESULTS\nForty-three articles representing 48 studies were included in this review. The most-documented risk factors are female gender and high school academic track. Exhaustion is the first dimension of SBO to develop. The most-documented risk factors are female gender and high school academic track. Relationships with parents serve as a protective factor. Outcomes of SBO include lower engagement at school, impaired identity development, and lower satisfaction with life. Complex relationships are found between SBO, problematic use of internet, problematic use of social media, and depressive symptoms.

However, less is known about how these factors develop and interact within and between school and sport when adolescent athletes follow dual (school and sport) careers. The aim of this study was to examine the reciprocal relationship between engagement and burnout in school and sport through a cross\u2010lagged analysis of longitudinal associations. Methods A sample of 165 Finnish adolescent athletes (aged 14.5 years, 48.9% girls) enrolled in lower secondary sport schools (i.e., junior high schools) participated in a survey in spring 2019 (i.e., in Grade 8) and 1 year later, in spring 2020 (i.e., in Grade 9). Results Engagement and burnout had significant autoregressive relationships within school and sport. Furthermore, low levels of sport engagement in Grade 8 predicted sport burnout in Grade 9, and low levels of school burnout in Grade 8 predicted school engagement in Grade 9. Regarding cross\u2010domain effects, high levels of school engagement in Grade 8 predicted low levels of sport engagement in Grade 9. Conclusions The study shows that school and sport are distinct domains with unique associations between engagement and burnout in each domain. It also shows that adolescent athletes may maintain high school engagement by reducing their sport engagement. These findings highlight the need for sport school practitioners to develop intervention programs to address adolescents' school and sport needs and to support their holistic well\u2010being.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2024-10-14", "synthetic_support_claim": "High school engagement can be maintained in adolescent athletes by reducing their sport engagement.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Increased physical activity directly reduces burnout in adolescent athletes."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "a6d8120e896d2302f057d8685898b89f5f43865d", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a6d8120e896d2302f057d8685898b89f5f43865d", "title": "Investigating the Roles of Gender, Age, and Sport Characteristics on School and Sport Burnout in Finnish Lower Secondary School Student Athletes.", "abstract": "School sport programs for lower secondary school in Finland (i.e., Grades 7-9) show great promise in helping student athletes prepare for careers in both sport and academic pursuits. However, it has also been found that participation in these programs is highly competitive and demanding and may result in poor mental health outcomes like burnout for some students. The purpose of the current study was to investigate how burnout in sport and school in Finnish lower secondary school students was associated with gender, age, training loads, level of competition, and sport type. A sample of 856 lower secondary school students (Grades 7-9, ages 13-15\u2009years old) completed measures of sport and school burnout and provided information on their demographics and sport. Gender, age, training loads, level of competition, and sport type predicted a small but significant portion of variance in sport-related exhaustion, cynicism, and inadequacy, and in school-related exhaustion, but not school cynicism or inadequacy. Females and student athletes with higher training loads generally reported higher levels of burnout, while only a small number of effects related to age, competition level, and type of sport were observed.

However, it is essential to understand that there needs to be more information regarding the readiness of prospective biology teacher students to implement this curriculum. Therefore, this research was conducted to describe the level of readiness of prospective biology teacher students for independent learning. In this research, 53 prospective teacher students were involved voluntarily as respondents, including 42 women and 11 men, consisting of 12 (semester 1), 15 (semester 3), 17 (semester 5), and 9 (semester 7).

Based on the results of the analysis, it was found that 16.98% were not very ready (low or unprepared), 73.58% were not ready (moderate), and 9.43% were ready (high). These results also show that prospective biology teacher students have the same level of readiness for independent learning or that there is no significant difference in readiness for independent learning based on semester differences. Apart from that, of the SRSSDL components, self-awareness and learning activities have the lowest averages (32.51 and 32.09).
