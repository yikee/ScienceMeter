At the as-grown state, the N\u00e9el order of NiO is randomly oriented due to the polycrystalline nature of the film structure, leading to increased spin absorption and blocking spin transport from the adjacent W layer. When the spin current amplitude exceeds a threshold value, SOT enables reorientation of the N\u00e9el order in NiO to an equilibrium state, forming a global N\u00e9el order aligned with the applied current. This long-range N\u00e9el order reduces spin absorption and enhances spin transport through NiO, hence boosting the SOT efficiency in the adjacent CoFeB layer. X-ray magnetic linear dichroism spectroscopy and rewritable N\u00e9el order reorientation experiments in a device with orthogonal geometry confirmed the strong correlation between the global N\u00e9el order facilitation and the boosted SOT efficiency, which is enhanced larger than 4-fold for both damping- and field-like torques in the trilayer with 5 nm NiO.

Given that the interdiffusion layer at the interface of plasma spray-physical vapour deposition (PS-PVD) coatings has been relatively underexplored and its influencing mechanisms remain unclear, this study investigates how different pre-oxidation layer states affect the thermal cycle life of PS-PVD coatings. Under conditions conducive to effective pre-oxidation film formation and minimal interdiffusion between NiCrAlYSi and 8YSZ, we observed an increase in thermal cycle life from 1000 h at 1100 \u00b0C to 2150 h. The application of high-heat flux jets, along with coupling factors related to preheating and pre-oxidation processes, can modulate interdiffusion at the interface. A thinner interdiffusion layer not only reduces oxidation rates but also enhances the longevity of the coating\u2019s thermal cycle. Ultimately, cracks may develop within the composite oxide film, leading to coating failure. The Al-rich component present in both the interdiffusion composite oxide diffusion layer and initially deposited gas phase 8YSZ contributes to a reduction in TGO growth rate, as well as interface stress levels. In scenarios involving high-heat flux jet preheating coupled with coating deposition processes, the oxygen ion concentration emerges as a pivotal factor regulating interdiffusion dynamics.

In this work, we report an amphiphilic molecular hole transporter, (2-(4-(bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amino)phenyl)-1-cyanovinyl)phosphonic acid, that features a multifunctional cyanovinyl phosphonic acid group and forms a superwetting underlayer for perovskite deposition, which enables high-quality perovskite films with minimized defects at the buried interface. The resulting perovskite film has a photoluminescence quantum yield of 17% and a Shockley-Read-Hall lifetime of nearly 7 microseconds and achieved a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.4% with an open-circuit voltage of 1.21 volts and a fill factor of 84.7%.

Currently, research works are focusing on constructing SAMs on metal oxide surfaces in p-i-n PSCs, but realizing a stable and dense SAM contact on halide perovskite surfaces in n-i-p PSCs is still challenging. In this work, the hole-selective molecule for n-i-p device is developed featuring a terephthalic methylammonium core structure that possesses double-site anchoring ability and a matching diameter (6.36 \u00c5) with the lattice constant of formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) perovskite (6.33 \u00c5), which facilitates an ordered and full-coverage SAM atop FAPbI3 perovskite. Moreover, theoretical calculations and experimental results indicate that compared to the frequently used acid or ester anchoring groups, this ionic anchoring group with a dipolar charge distribution has much larger adsorption energy on both organic halide terminated and lead halide terminated surfaces, resulting in synergistic improvement of carrier extraction and defect passivation ability.

This work first found that a bimetallic single-atom catalyst (Co/Zn-N-C SAC) could effectively activate dissolved O2 to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to its superior oxidase (OXD)-like activity. Experimental investigations demonstrated that Co/Zn-N-C SAC preferred to produce highly active hydroxyl radicals (\u2022OH), which oxidized 3-amino-9-ethyl carbazole (AEC) to produce reddish-brown insoluble precipitates. Based on this property, a unique oxygen-activated photoelectrochemical (PEC) biosensor was developed for chloramphenicol (CAP) detection. Cesium platinum bromide nanocrystals (Cs2PtBr6 NCs) were a new type of halide perovskite with lead-free, narrow band gaps, and water-oxygen resistance. Cs2PtBr6 NCs showed excellent cathodal PEC performance without an exogenous coreactant and were first used for PEC detection. As a \"proof-of-concept application\", Co/Zn-N-C SAC was introduced onto the surface of Cs2PtBr6 NCs by using the CAP dual-aptamer sandwich strategy. Co/Zn-N-C SAC activated dissolved O2 to produce ROS, which oxidized AEC to produce precipitates, quenching the cathodal PEC signal of Cs2PtBr6 NCs for CAP detection.

MXenes are commonly synthesized by etching the layered ternary compounds, called MAX phases. We demonstrate a direct synthetic route for scalable and atom-economic synthesis of MXenes, including compounds that have not been synthesized from MAX phases, by the reactions of metals and metal halides with graphite, methane, or nitrogen. The direct synthesis enables chemical vapor deposition growth of MXene carpets and complex spherulite-like morphologies that form through buckling and release of MXene carpet to expose fresh surface for further reaction. The directly synthesized MXenes showed excellent energy storage capacity for lithium-ion intercalation. Description MXenes without MAX phases Two-dimensional metal carbides and nitrides, or MXenes, have several potential applications in energy storage and electronics. They are usually made by delamination of a layered parent compound, a MAX phase, in a harsh etching step.

The vertically grown NCNTs, serving as bridging pillars in the interlamination, not only significantly augment the interlayer structure but also forge a robust interconnection among the monolayered MXenes. Therefore, this design simultaneously realizes the enlargement of the interlayer space to facilitate electrolyte infiltration for fast ion transport and enhances the interlayer conductivity for rapid electron transport through the NCNTs bridging pillars.

Designing better electrolytes and interphases holds the key to the success of these batteries. As the only component that interfaces with every other component in the device, an electrolyte must satisfy multiple criteria simultaneously. These include transporting ions while insulating electrons between the electrodes and maintaining stability against electrodes of extreme chemical natures: the strongly oxidative cathode and the strongly reductive anode. In most advanced batteries, the two electrodes operate at potentials far beyond the thermodynamic stability limits of electrolytes, so the stability therein has to be realized kinetically through an interphase formed from the sacrificial reactions between electrolyte and electrodes. Description Progress and challenges for electrolytes Compared with the development of new cathodes and anodes, there has been less of a focus on the development of electrolytes. However, it is the electrolyte that controls the flow of ions and charges, and it is the only component in intimate contact with all the others. With the push toward higher energy and power densities, electrolytes are also involved in kinetically formed interphases that aid in the stability of a battery but can also hamper its operation. In a review, Meng et al. captures a number of trends that have emerged in the development of advanced battery electrolytes. \u2014MSL A review discusses progress in designing better electrolytes for electrochemical devices. BACKGROUND The electrolyte is an indispensable component in every electrochemical device, including lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). It physically segregates two electrodes from direct electron transfer while allowing working ions to transport both charges and masses across the cell so that the cell reactions can proceed sustainably. Whether powering our phones, driving our vehicles, or harvesting the intermittent energy from solar and wind farms, electrolytes in these LIBs determine how fast and how many times our devices can be recharged or how efficiently energy can be captured and stored over the grid. Occasionally, when an LIB is pushed away from the designed electrochemistry pathways by various factors such as excessive heat, mechanical mutilation, or internal short circuits induced under extreme charging conditions, electrolytes are also responsible for the fire and explosion accidents that we read about in the news. The electrolyte is the most unique component in a battery. Because it must physically interface with every other component, it is obligated to satisfy numerous constraints simultaneously, including rapidly transporting ions and masses, effectively insulating electrons, and maintaining stability toward the strongly oxidative cathode and strongly reductive anode. Historically, the electrolyte-anode interfacing was the last piece of the puzzle to complete modern LIB chemistry. ADVANCES The commercial success of LIBs has attracted intense interest and investments in electrolyte research, which led to the identification of interphases as the key component responsible for the stable and reversible operations of cathode and anode materials far beyond the thermodynamic stability limits of any known electrolyte. These interphases, often with nanometer thickness, are formed by electrolytes in a self-limiting decomposition process, and they ensure fast rates of charging and discharging, maximum voltage, and reversibility of LIBs. In the past three decades, the chemistry, morphology, and formation mechanisms of interphases have been thoroughly investigated. Researchers have learned how such interphases are structured and what key ingredients they comprise and, most importantly, how to tailor them using electrolyte engineering. Today, it is widely accepted that designing better electrolytes also implies designing the associated interphases for the electrode materials. Although the accurate prediction of interphasial chemistry remains difficult, and key fundamental properties of interphases such as the rate and mechanism of ion transport across interphases are still unknown, the structure of the ion solvation sheath has been identified as an effective tool that directs the formation process of interphases. Such knowledge has been driving a series of new electrolyte concepts for emerging battery chemistries. OUTLOOK Efforts are being made to develop battery chemistries that promise high energy density, rapid charging, low cost, high sustainability, and independence from elements or materials of high geopolitical or ethical risks. Each individual chemistry may demand a unique electrolyte and corresponding interphase, but a few universal trends emerge: (i) a super-concentration of salts is used to leverage unusual properties arising from the altered ion-solvation structures; (ii) both polymeric and inorganic materials are used to solidify electrolytes so that the aggressive lithium-metal anode can be harnessed with higher safety; (iii) efforts are made to identify the most effective interphasial ingredients so that an interphase of singular composition can be designed and artificially applied; (iv) liquefied gaseous components are used to expand the low-temperature limits of conventional electrolytes; and (v) unusual electrochemical behaviors are explored by confining ion-solvation sheaths in nano- or sub-nano environments. Electrolytes and the associated interphases play the central role in supporting diversified battery chemistries. On the anode side (left), the electrolyte must form an interphase that prevents graphitic anode from exfoliation, tolerates the drastic volume changes of a silicon electrode, and suppresses the growth of a dendritic form of lithium metal. On the cathode side (right), an interphase is critical in preventing the irreversible reactions with electrolytes, maintaining the lattice structure of transition metal oxides, suppressing the cross-cell shuttling of polysulfide species, and assisting the complicated triphasial reactions of an air-cathode. In all of these scenarios, interphases must enable ionic transport while insulating electronic transport.", "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-12-09", "synthetic_support_claim": "Designing better electrolytes implies inherently designing the associated interphases for electrode materials.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Solid-state electrolytes are necessary for improving the safety and performance of lithium-ion batteries."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "3e69fac95593c820fefe6f2664b35b8ac4480f52", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3e69fac95593c820fefe6f2664b35b8ac4480f52", "title": "Solutions for Lithium Battery Materials Data Issues in Machine Learning: Overview and Future Outlook", "abstract": "Abstract The application of machine learning (ML) techniques in the lithium battery field is relatively new and holds great potential for discovering new materials, optimizing electrochemical processes, and predicting battery life.

We engineer a robust soil bacterium, Pseudomonas putida, to funnel these oxygenated compounds into a single exemplary chemical product, either \u03b2-ketoadipate or polyhydroxyalkanoates. This hybrid process establishes a strategy for the selective conversion of mixed plastics waste into useful chemical products.

If plastic waste could instead be converted to valuable chemical intermediates, then economical use of mixed waste as a feedstock might be feasible.

Pseudomonas putida actively forms biofilms to protect the population under tetracycline stress, but the molecular mechanism remains unclear. This study found that tetracycline at sub-minimal inhibitory concentrations increased cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP), a second messenger that positively regulates biofilm formation. Four c-di-GMP-metabolizing proteins were found to be involved in the tetracycline-mediated biofilm promotion, including DibA, WspR, PP_3242, and PP_3319. Among them, the diguanylate cyclase WspR displayed the most significant effect on c-di-GMP level and biofilm formation. WspR belongs to the wsp operon comprising seven genes (wspA\u2013wspF and wspR). The wsp operon contained six promoters, including one major start promoter (PwspA) and five internal promoters (PwspB, PwspC, PwspD, PwspF, and PwspR), and tetracycline promoted the activity of PwspA. The stress-response sigma factor RpoS directly bound to PwspA and positively regulated its activity under tetracycline stress. Moreover, RpoS was required for tetracycline to induce PwspA activity and promote biofilm formation. Our results enrich the transcriptional regulation of the wsp operon and reveal the mechanism by which tetracycline promotes biofilm formation in P. putida. IMPORTANCE The overuse and wanton discharge of antibiotics produces a threat to bacteria in the environment, which, in turn, stimulates the more rapid emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The Pseudomonas putida actively forms biofilm against antibiotic threats, but the mechanism remains unclear. Here, our results showed that tetracycline treatment at sub-minimal inhibitory concentrations could induce the expression of the Wsp system via the sigma factor RpoS in P. putida, resulting in elevated c-di-GMP levels, which leads to increased biofilm formation.

Description Lithium niobate photonics The optoelectronic and nonlinear optical properties of lithium niobate make it a workhorse material for applications in optics and communication technology. Boes et al. reviewed the science and technology of lithium niobate and its role in various aspects of photonic technology. They surveyed the evolution from bulk lithium niobate through weakly confining waveguides to the recent developments with thin-film lithium niobate. The ability to span the entire spectral range from radio to optical wavelengths illustrates the versatility of lithium niobate as a platform material in integrated photonics. \u2014ISO A review discusses the science and technology of lithium niobate and its role in various aspects of photonics. BACKGROUND Electromagnetic (EM) waves underpin modern society in profound ways. They are used to carry information, enabling broadcast radio and television, mobile telecommunications, and ubiquitous access to data networks through Wi-Fi and form the backbone of our modern broadband internet through optical fibers. In fundamental physics, EM waves serve as an invaluable tool to probe objects from cosmic to atomic scales. For example, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory and atomic clocks, which are some of the most precise human-made instruments in the world, rely on EM waves to reach unprecedented accuracies. This has motivated decades of research to develop coherent EM sources over broad spectral ranges with impressive results: Frequencies in the range of tens of gigahertz (radio and microwave regimes) can readily be generated by electronic oscillators. Resonant tunneling diodes enable the generation of millimeter (mm) and terahertz (THz) waves, which span from tens of gigahertz to a few terahertz. At even higher frequencies, up to the petahertz level, which are usually defined as optical frequencies, coherent waves can be generated by solid-state and gas lasers. However, these approaches often suffer from narrow spectral bandwidths, because they usually rely on well-defined energy states of specific materials, which results in a rather limited spectral coverage. To overcome this limitation, nonlinear frequency-mixing strategies have been developed. These approaches shift the complexity from the EM source to nonresonant-based material effects. Particularly in the optical regime, a wealth of materials exist that support effects that are suitable for frequency mixing. Over the past two decades, the idea of manipulating these materials to form guiding structures (waveguides) has provided improvements in efficiency, miniaturization, and production scale and cost and has been widely implemented for diverse applications. ADVANCES Lithium niobate, a crystal that was first grown in 1949, is a particularly attractive photonic material for frequency mixing because of its favorable material properties. Bulk lithium niobate crystals and weakly confining waveguides have been used for decades for accessing different parts of the EM spectrum, from gigahertz to petahertz frequencies. Now, this material is experiencing renewed interest owing to the commercial availability of thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN). This integrated photonic material platform enables tight mode confinement, which results in frequency-mixing efficiency improvements by orders of magnitude while at the same time offering additional degrees of freedom for engineering the optical properties by using approaches such as dispersion engineering. Importantly, the large refractive index contrast of TFLN enables, for the first time, the realization of lithium niobate\u2013based photonic integrated circuits on a wafer scale. OUTLOOK The broad spectral coverage, ultralow power requirements, and flexibilities of lithium niobate photonics in EM wave generation provides a large toolset to explore new device functionalities. Furthermore, the adoption of lithium niobate\u2013integrated photonics in foundries is a promising approach to miniaturize essential bench-top optical systems using wafer scale production. Heterogeneous integration of active materials with lithium niobate has the potential to create integrated photonic circuits with rich functionalities. Applications such as high-speed communications, scalable quantum computing, artificial intelligence and neuromorphic computing, and compact optical clocks for satellites and precision sensing are expected to particularly benefit from these advances and provide a wealth of opportunities for commercial exploration. Also, bulk crystals and weakly confining waveguides in lithium niobate are expected to keep playing a crucial role in the near future because of their advantages in high-power and loss-sensitive quantum optics applications.

The salient feature is a carbon mask with a low sputter yield that can be readily shaped using high resolution electron beam processing techniques. When combined with focused ion beam processing, the masking technique yields structures with ultra-smooth, near-vertical side walls. We target different material platforms to showcase the broad utility of the technique. As a first test case, we prepared nanometric gaps in evaporated Au. Gap widths of 7 plus/minus 2 nm, aspect ratios of 17, and line edge roughness values of 3sigma = 2.04 nm are achieved. Furthermore, the gap widths represent an order of magnitude improvement on system resolution limits. As a second test case, we designed and fabricated dielectric resonators in the ternary compounds MnPSe3 and NiPS3; a class of van der Waals material resistant to chemical etch approaches. Nanoantenna arrays with incrementally increasing diameter were fabricated in crystalline, exfoliated flakes. The optical response was measured by dark field spectroscopy and is in agreement with simulations.

We demonstrate the ability of high-entropy metal cation mixes to improve ionic conductivity in a compound, which leads to less reliance on specific chemistries and enhanced synthesizability. The local distortions introduced into high-entropy materials give rise to an overlapping distribution of site energies for the alkali ions so that they can percolate with low activation energy. Experiments verify that high entropy leads to orders-of-magnitude higher ionic conductivities in lithium (Li)\u2013sodium (Na) superionic conductor (Li-NASICON), sodium NASICON (Na-NASICON), and Li-garnet structures, even at fixed alkali content. We provide insight into selecting the optimal distortion and designing high-entropy superionic conductors across the vast compositional space. Description High entropy by design A key property for solid-state battery electrolytes is the ability to rapidly transport lithium ions. This property can be achieved by developing a percolating pathway or by increasing the mobility of the carrier ions in the electrolyte. However, standard design methods limit the selection of dopants and complicate the synthesis. Zeng et al. adapted some of the concepts of high-entropy materials to the development of solid electrolytes (see the Perspective by Botros and Janek). The addition of a mixture of high-entropy metal cations induces local disorder, thus creating overlapping site energy distributions for charge-carrying ions. This approach results in a percolating network of connected sites with a reduced energy difference and correspondingly fast lithium ion transport, as demonstrated for lithium- and sodium-based batteries. \u2014MSL High-entropy design can lead to orders of magnitude increases in ionic conductivity regardless of the crystal framework.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-12-23", "synthetic_support_claim": "High-entropy design can lead to orders of magnitude increases in ionic conductivity regardless of the crystal framework.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "High-entropy design improves ionic conductivity in all types of solid-state battery crystal frameworks."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "9edc33d4e49a517ee0ebf094b8d6d6d9031de4a9", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9edc33d4e49a517ee0ebf094b8d6d6d9031de4a9", "title": "High Entropy Oxide Duplex Yolk-Shell Structure with Isogenic Amorphous/Crystalline Heterophase as a Promising Anode Material for Lithium-Ion Batteries.", "abstract": "Achieving composition and structure regulation on high entropy materials is a big challenge but will give this kind of new materials a huge boost in energy storage.

Through solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), we can explore the chemical environment as well as short-range lithium-ion dynamics and compare these to results obtained from neutron diffraction and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). We find that the cooling method has a profound effect on the 7Li and 31P environment that cannot be explained through 4d site disorder alone. The configurational entropy (Sconf) is used as a more complete descriptor of structural disorder and linked to distortions in both the phosphorus and lithium environment. These distortions are correlated to increased intercage movement through 7Li T1 spin\u2013lattice relaxation (SLR) NMR. Further analysis of the prefactors obtained from SLR NMR and EIS allows us to obtain the migrational entropy (\u0394Sm). For short-range SLR movement, the \u0394Sm correlates well with Sconf, implying that increased intercage movement is related to distortion of the lithium cages as well as a decrease of the intercage distance. Comparison to EIS shows that an increase in short-range movement translates into increased long-range movement in a straightforward manner for slow-cooled samples. However, for quench-cooled samples, this correlation is lost. Lattice softness and phonon\u2013ion interactions are suggested to play an important role in long-range conduction which only becomes apparent when chemical composition and disorder are disentangled. This work shows that by altering one synthesis step, the relationship between site-occupancy-based descriptors (site disorder or Sconf) and lithium dynamics is changed profoundly. Furthermore, it shows that chemical composition and descriptors of site disorder cannot be seen as one and the same, as both play a role that changes with the length scale probed.

Herein, the rule of how the size of the migration channel and electrostatic interaction affect Zn2+ and Li+ migration in \u03b1-V2O5 has been systematically investigated by first-principle calculations. It is found that expanding the layer spacing can facilitate Zn2+ migration. Once the layer spacing surpasses a certain threshold, further expansion does not lead to a continued reduction in the migration barrier. The local structure distortions caused by electron small polarons would lead to a decrease in migration channel size, which should have increased the energy barrier for Li+ and Zn2+ migration. However, interestingly, the electron small polarons decrease the energy barriers, which would be attributed to the ion-polaron electrostatic attraction. The higher activation barriers for the migration of Zn2+ ions compared to those of Li+ ions can be rationalized by the specific ion-polaron electrostatic attraction for Zn2+.

The analysis of literature data confirmed the production of selenium in its chemically pure state. The negative value of the zeta potential of Se nanoparticles was demonstrated, which contributes to their electrical stability and ability to be uniformly distributed in solutions without the formation of aggregates or precipitates. The formation of nanohybrids after the addition of protein shows a tendency to positive values, indicating a significant effect of protein on the surface characteristics of SeNPs.

In this study, we present a benchmarking approach based on metal chalcogenide NCs as a model system. We synthesized a series of bimetallic, iron-cobalt chalcogenide NCs [Co6-xFexS8(PEt3)6]+ (x = 0-6) (PEt = triethyl phosphine) and investigated the effect of heteroatoms in the octahedral metal chalcogenide core on their size and electronic properties. Using ion mobility-mass spectrometry (IM-MS), we observed a gradual increase in the collision cross section (CCS) with an increase in the number of Fe atoms in the core. DFT calculations combined with trajectory method CCS simulations successfully reproduced this trend, revealing that the increase in cluster size is primarily due to changes in metal-ligand bond lengths, while the electronic properties of the core remain largely unchanged. Moreover, this method allowed us to exclude certain multiplicity states of the NCs, as their CCS values were significantly different from those predicted for the lowest-energy structures. This study demonstrates that gas-phase IM-MS is a powerful technique for detecting subtle size differences in atomically precise NCs, which are often challenging to observe using conventional NC characterization methods.

Second, high-performance NIB cathode materials can be fabricated by using solely inexpensive and noncritical transition metals such as manganese and iron, which further reduces the cost of the required raw materials. Recently, the unprecedented demand for lithium and other critical minerals has driven the cost of these primary raw materials (which are utilized in LIBs) to a historic high and thus triggered the commercialization of NIBs. Sodium layered transition metal oxides (NaxTMO2, TM = transition metal/s), such as Mn-based sodium layered oxides, represent an important family of cathode materials with the potential to reduce costs, increase energy density and cycling stability, and improve the safety of NIBs for large-scale energy storage. However, these layered oxides face several key challenges, including irreversible phase transformations during cycling, poor air stability, complex charge-compensation mechanisms, and relatively high cost of the full cell compared to LiFePO4-based LIBs. Our work has focused on the techno-economic analysis, the degradation mechanism of NaxTMO2 upon cycling and air exposure, and the development of effective strategies to improve their electrochemical performances and air stability. Correlating structure\u2013performance relationships and establishing general design strategies of NaxTMO2 must be considered for the commercialization of NIBs. In this Account, we discuss the recent progress in the development of air-stable, electrochemically stable, and cost-effective NaxTMO2. The favorable redox-active cations for NaxTMO2 are emphasized in terms of abundance, cost, supply, and energy density. Different working mechanisms related to NaxTMO2 are summarized, including the electrochemical reversibility, the main structural transformations during the charge and discharge processes, and the charge-compensation mechanisms that accompany the (de)intercalation of Na+ ions, followed by discussions to improve the stability toward ambient air and upon cycling. Then the techno-economics are presented, with an emphasis on cathodes with different chemical compositions, cost breakdown of battery packs, and Na deficiency, factors that are critical to the large-scale implementation. Finally, this Account concludes with an overview of the remaining challenges and new opportunities concerning the practical applications of NaxTMO2, with an emphasis on the cost, large-scale fabrication capability, and electrochemical performance.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-01-25", "synthetic_support_claim": "Mn-based sodium layered oxides can reduce costs and improve energy density and cycling stability in NIBs.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "NIBs will completely replace LIBs in all applications within the next decade."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "3d76c039f782f23340771d275dfec9bbe995ed02", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3d76c039f782f23340771d275dfec9bbe995ed02", "title": "Understanding of a Ni\u2010Rich O3\u2010Layered Cathode for Sodium\u2010Ion Batteries: Synthesis Mechanism and Al\u2010Gradient Doping", "abstract": "Abstract O3\u2010type NaNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NaNMC811) cathode active materials for sodium\u2013ion batteries (SIBs), with a theoretical high specific capacity (\u223c 187 mAh g\u22121), are in the preliminary exploration stage.

Interestingly, such self\u2010adhesive PDMS foam produces strong interfacial adhesion with the hybrid MXene/CNF nano\u2010coatings. Consequently, the optimized PDMS foam nanocomposites have excellent surface super\u2010hydrophobicity (water contact angle of \u2248159o), tunable electrical conductivity (from 10\u22128 to 10 S m\u22121), stable compressive cyclic reliability in both wide\u2010temperature range (from \u221220 to 200 oC) and complex environments (acid, sodium, and alkali conditions), outstanding flame resistance (LOI value of >27% and low smoke production rate), good thermal insulating performance and reliable strain sensing in various stress modes and complex environmental conditions.

Therefore, PBAT/single\u2010walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) porous material was prepared via a salt\u2010templating method. It was found that part of the SWCNT was embedded in the walls of the pores in the PBAT substrate, while another part was exposed on the pore surface. PBAT served as the structural framework, and SWCNT functioned mainly as the active component, especially the SWCNT exposed on the surface. This unique microstructure imparted the porous material with desirable piezoresistive properties and effective electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding capabilities. When the material was compressed, the exposed SWCNT was forced into closer contact, increasing the number of electrical transport pathways and further enhancing conductivity. The resulting porous sensor exhibited a notable response to strain up to 100% and demonstrated high sensitivity (1.25) while maintaining robust cyclic stability after 1000\u2009cycles. Human pulse and finger flexion were successfully recorded using the fabricated porous sensor. Moreover, the porous material displayed EMI shielding capabilities, primarily through the absorption of electromagnetic (EM) waves, a phenomenon associated with the rough surface of the pores created by the exposed SWCNT.

Micro-perforated sandwich structures with foam filling are therefore proposed in the paper to obtain wideband low-frequency sound absorption. An integrated analytical, numerical and experimental research is conducted to investigate sound absorption and lightweight characteristics of four commonly used micro-perforated sandwich structures with honeycomb (PHSP), corrugated (PCSP), N hybrid (PNHSP) and honeycomb-corrugated (PHCSP) cores.

Isolated atom site catalysts (IASCs) have been developed as an ideal system to precisely regulate the oxidation state and coordination environment of single-metal centers, and thus optimize their catalytic property. The isolated metal sites in IASCs inherently possess a positive oxidation state, and can be more readily produce homogeneous high-valence active sites under oxidative potentials than their nanoparticle counterparts. Meanwhile, IASCs merely possess the isolated metal centers but lack ensemble metal sites, which can alter the adsorption configurations of small molecules as compared with nanoparticle counterparts, and thus induce various reaction pathways and mechanisms to change product selectivity.

A dehydroxylated PVA-based membrane (DHPVA) is synthesized at a relatively low temperature in a highly concentrated alkaline solution. Part of the hydroxyl groups are removed and, as a result, the hydrogen bonding between PVA chains, which is deemed responsible for the sluggish ion transport kinetics, is minimized. At 20\u00a0\u00b0C, the ionic conductivity of DHPVA reaches 12.5\u00a0mS\u00a0cm-1, which is almost 4 times higher than that of PVA. Additionally, DHPVA effectively promotes uniform Zn deposition, leading to a significantly extended cycle life and reduced polarization, both in a/symmetric (Cu/Zn and Zn/Zn) and full cells (Zn/NaV3O8).

Lowering the carbon footprint of buildings requires the development of carbon-storage materials as well as novel designs that could enable multifunctional components to achieve widespread applications. Wood is one of the most abundant biomaterials on Earth and has been used for construction historically. Recent research breakthroughs on advanced engineered wood products epitomize this material's tremendous yet largely untapped potential for addressing global sustainability challenges. In this review, we explore recent developments in chemically modified wood that will produce a new generation of engineered wood products for building applications. Traditionally, engineered wood products have primarily had a structural purpose, but this review broadens the classification to encompass more aspects of building performance. We begin by providing multiscale design principles of wood products from a computational point of view, followed by discussion of the chemical modifications and structural engineering methods used to modify wood in terms of its mechanical, thermal, optical, and energy-related performance. Additionally, we explore life cycle assessment and techno-economic analysis tools for guiding future research toward environmentally friendly and economically feasible directions for engineered wood products.

This study investigated eight different postmanufacture drying processes, including: ambient indoor and outdoor conditions, oven-drying at two different temperatures, microwave drying, alcohol-induced dehydration using ethanol and denatured alcohol, and desiccant drying. Each postmanufacture conditioning treatment was assessed in terms of total moisture extraction and moisture extraction rate as well as the flexural strength, flexural stiffness, and hardness of the wood\u2013sodium silicate samples after drying. In addition, the water absorption and volumetric swelling properties of the additively manufactured wood\u2013sodium silicate samples were assessed via water submersion tests. The postmanufacture conditioning treatments were found to significantly affect the mechanical and physical properties of the samples. A universal ranking system was established based on cumulative rankings of each evaluated characteristic.

Even under optimal conditions, at least one-third of the metals will also in the future come from primary production, creating huge emissions. Although the influence of metals on global warming has been discussed with respect to mitigation strategies and socio-economic factors, the fundamental materials science to make the metallurgical sector more sustainable has been less addressed. This may be attributed to the fact that the field of sustainable metals describes a global challenge, but not yet a homogeneous research field. However, the sheer magnitude of this challenge and its huge environmental effects, caused by more than 2 billion tonnes of metals produced every year, make its sustainability an essential research topic not only from a technological point of view but also from a basic materials research perspective. Therefore, this paper aims to identify and discuss the most pressing scientific bottleneck questions and key mechanisms, considering metal synthesis from primary (minerals), secondary (scrap), and tertiary (re-mined) sources as well as the energy-intensive downstream processing.

The efficacy of nanofibers composed of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/polyethylene oxide (PEO)/chitosan (CS) in promoting wound healing can be attributed to their ability to stimulate collagen production. Among the herbal agents with fewer adverse effects, Tragopogon graminifolius DC. [Asteraceae] (TG), also called \u201cSheng\u201d in traditional Iranian medicine, is one of the most efficacious plants for treating various skin injuries due to its several pharmacological and biological effects like anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Purpose In the present study, our objective was to assess the wound-healing activity of PVA/PEO/CS nanofibers containing TG in a rat model of excision wound repair. Methods Synthesized nanofibers from PVA, PEO, and CS were done by the electrospinning method and confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The release tests of nanofibers were assessed through the UV-visible method at different time intervals, which were conducted for about 60 h. To evaluate the wound healing effects, rats were divided into four distinct groups, including negative control (untreated), phenytoin cream (as positive control), polymer (PVA/PEO/CS), and drug (nanofiber-containing 50% of TG extract; named PVA/PEO/CS/TG) groups. All treatments were administered topically once daily for 14 days. Wound size changes were investigated in different time intervals. On the 15th day, nitrite and catalase serum levels were measured. Furthermore, samples of skin tissue were extracted and subjected to histopathological analysis. Results PVA/PEO/CS nanofibers containing 1.2 g of PVA, 0.3 g of PEO, and 0.8 g of CS, along with 50% of TG extract (PVA/PEO/CS/TG) at 17 kV were selected based on its favorable morphology and uniform quality. PVA/PEO/CS/TG represented a notable reduction in wound sizes. Moreover, in histopathological analysis, PVA/PEO/CS/TG showed a lower presence of inflammatory cells, higher density of dermis collagen fibers, and better regeneration of the epidemic layer. In addition, PVA/PEO/CS/TG elevated plasma antioxidant capacity via increasing catalase while reducing nitrite levels. Conclusion PVA/PEO/CS/TG is a promising wound dressing nanofiber with antioxidant and tissue regeneration potential.

In this context, MgO is a highly promising, earth-abundant CO2 sorbent. However, despite its favorable carbonation thermodynamics and potential for high gravimetric CO2 uptakes, MgO-based CO2 sorbents feature slow carbonation kinetics, limiting their CO2 uptake during typical industrial contact times. The addition of molten alkali metal nitrate promoters, such as NaNO3, can partially mitigate the slow kinetics. Here, we investigate how the CO2 uptake kinetics of NaNO3-promoted MgO can be increased further through the addition of finely dispersed Na2CO3. The incorporation of Na2CO3 significantly increases the CO2 uptake rate from 1.4 to 14.6 mmol MgCO3 (mol MgO)\u22121 s\u20131. Using in situ synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), we track the formation of MgCO3 and elucidate the mechanism through which Na2CO3 promotes the CO2 uptake of MgO. Our findings demonstrate that Na2CO3 rapidly converts within seconds into Na2Mg(CO3)2 during carbonation, acting subsequently as nucleation seeds for MgCO3 formation, in turn significantly enhancing CO2 uptake kinetics. Further, the presence of Na2Mg(CO3)2 considerably enhances the mobility of ions in the sorbent, leading to sintering of MgCO3. Importantly, Na2Mg(CO3)2 promotes MgCO3 formation even in the presence of molten RbNO3, a salt with a limited ability to dissolve [Mg2+\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7CO32\u2013] ion pairs, indicating that Na2Mg(CO3)2 lowers the critical ion pair concentration required for MgCO3 nucleation.

To tackle this challenge, we have developed an efficient heteronuclear dual-atom catalyst (hetero-DAC) that leverages surface charge polarization to enhance the asymmetric adsorption of sulfur intermediates. This study investigates how asymmetric electronic redistribution of CoFe DACs modulates the d-p orbital hybridization with sulfur intermediates, revealing the mechanisms of moderate adsorption dynamics with enhanced catalytic performance.

Substantial electrochemistry and theoretical analyses reveal that CoTe2-x exhibits higher catalytic activity in long-chain polysulfide transformation and Li2S decomposition, while monodispersed Co sites are more effective in boosting sulfur reduction kinetics to regulate Li2S deposition. Such cascade catalysis endows CoSA-CoTe2-x@NHCF with the all-around service of \"trapping-conversion-recuperation\" for sulfur species during the whole redox reaction.

Conventional methods to measure the catalyst temperature, with a thermocouple in the reactor oven or in the catalyst bed, suffer from complications because of separation between the sensor and catalyst material, chemical activity of the thermocouple/coating material, added complexity of the setup, and disruption of the reactant flow and heat flow through the catalyst bed. Here, we show the possibilities and challenges of luminescence thermometry as an analytical technique for remote temperature monitoring of the local catalyst temperature in a strongly exothermic high\u2010temperature reaction environment.

The traditional hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical recycling methods are doubted because of the economic and environmental benefits; the direct regeneration method is considered a promising way to recycle spent LFP. However, the performance of regenerated LFP by direct recycling is not ideal due to the migration of Fe ions during cycling and irreversible phase transition caused by sluggish Li+ diffusion. The key to addressing the challenge is to immobilize Fe atoms in the lattice and improve the Li+ migration capability during cycling.

Such a review will succinctly capture recent developments in both experimental and theoretical fields. It will delve into multiple defective engineering approaches to advance the development of ideal carbon-based electrocatalysts and photocatalysts.

Consequently, this tailored electrolyte, combined with a robust SEI, enables hard carbon (HC) anodes to achieve a high reversible capacity of 223 mAh g\u22121 at a fast rate of 5\u00a0C. When paired with a high\u2010voltage NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (NFM) cathode, the HC||NFM full cells operate stably at a high cut\u2010off voltage of 4.15 V, sustaining over 1400 cycles at 5\u00a0C. Furthermore, a practical 3 Ah pouch cell demonstrates excellent stability, retaining 90.7% of its capacity after 1000 cycles, and shows all\u2010climate adaptability, maintaining 56.4% of its room\u2010temperature capacity at \u221260\u00a0\u00b0C and 97.3% retention after 350 cycles at 50\u00a0\u00b0C.

Recently, atomic catalysts (ACs) have gained increased attention for their superior catalytic properties, being able to outperform their micro and nano counterparts. This review examines the advantages and disadvantages of ACs and summarises the advancement of ACs in the electrocatalytic synthesis of ammonia and urea. The focus is on two types of AC - single-atom catalysts (SACs) and diatom catalysts (DACs). SACs offer various advantages, including the 100% atom utilization that allows for low material mass loading, suppression of competitive reactions such as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and alternative reaction pathways allowing for efficient synthesis of ammonia and urea. DACs inherit these advantages, possessing further benefits of synergistic effects between the two catalytic centers at close proximity, particularly matching the N\ue002N bond for N2 reduction and boosting C-N coupling for urea synthesis.

The decellularized tissue obtained through the tissue decellularization technique retains the structure and bioactive components of its native tissue; it not only exhibits comparatively strong mechanical properties, low immunogenicity and good biocompatibility but also stimulates in situ neovascularization at the implantation site and regulates the polarization process of recruited macrophages, thereby promoting the regeneration of damaged tissue.

The resulting scaffolds typically exhibit a powdery microstructure, which may potentially impact the behavior of immune cells and immune responses in surrounding tissues. However, limited research has been conducted to understand the effect of surface morphology in SLS-fabricated scaffolds on local immune environments. This study aims to compare the effect of SLS-fabricated polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffolds with powdery and smooth surface morphologies on immune-related biological responses. Compared with those on the powdery micromorphology, RAW264.7 macrophages displayed greater dispersion and adopted a spread and elongated morphology on the scaffolds with smooth surface. The expression levels of arginase-1 and CD206 were found to be upregulated in macrophages adhering to the PCL scaffolds with smooth surface, accompanied by an augmented secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines TGF-\u03b2 and IL-10. Conversely, there was a decrease in the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and IL-12. When implanted in\u00a0vivo, the SLS-derived scaffolds were completely covered by host tissues, Withing increased collagen deposition, indicating good histocompatibility. At 1-week post-implantation, there was a significantly higher presence of M2-type macrophages surrounding the scaffold compared to M1 macrophages in both groups. By 3\u2009weeks post-implantation, the overall level of macrophages had decreased in both groups. However, a significant higher level of M1 macrophages were observed in the powdery scaffold group.

Polymeric carbon nitride (CN) has become the most promising photocatalyst, but still suffers from major drawbacks of insufficient catalytic sites and low quantum efficiency. Herein, we report a fluid shear stress-assisted molecular assembly to prepare ultrathin-nanosheet-assembled acanthosphere-like CN (ASCN) with nitrogen vacancy (Nv) and carbonyl modification. Shear stress breaks the stacking interactions between layers and cuts the stacked structure into ultrathin layers, which are further reassembled into acanthosphere bundles driven by \"centrifugal force\". Benefitted greatly from the ultrathin nature that provides more exposed active sites and improves charge carrier separation, ASCN-3 exhibits a 20-fold higher activity than the bulk counterpart toward oxygen reduction to H2O2 coupled with 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol (4-MBA) oxidation to anisaldehyde (AA), with significantly increased turnover frequency (TOF) values (TOF: 1.69 h-1 for H2O2 and 1.02 h-1 for AA). Significantly, ASCN-3 exhibits 95.8% conversion for 4-MBA oxidation with nearly 100% selectivity. High apparent quantum yields of 11.7% and 9.3% at 420 nm are achieved for H2O2 photosynthesis and 4-MBA oxidation. Mechanism studies suggest that carbonyl induces holes concentrated at the neighboring melem unit to directly oxidize the C\u03b1-H bond of 4-MBA to produce carbon radicals, and Nv as oxygen adsorption active site traps electrons to form a superoxide radical that further combines with the shed protons into H2O2.

Although the bulk of the research has focused on improving transport kinetics and electrochemical stability of the materials and interfaces, there are also critical challenges that require investigation of the mechanics of materials. In batteries with solid-solid interfaces, mechanical contacts, and the development of stresses during operation of the solid-state batteries, become as critical as the electrochemical stability to keep steady charge transfer at these interfaces. This review will focus on stress and strain that result from normal and extended battery cycling and the associated mechanisms for stress relief, some of which lead to failure of these batteries. Description Editor\u2019s summary Replacing a liquid electrolyte with a solid one has the potential to improve the capacity and safety of lithium metal batteries. Although the focus has been on the electrochemical behavior, internal stresses and strains can also substantially alter battery performance and lifetime. Kalnaus et al. reviewed our understanding of the mechanics of solid-state batteries and the effect of having multiple solid-solid interfaces. They also looked at ways to alleviate stresses through additional materials and designs to improve the lifetime and performance of these batteries. \u2014Marc S. Lavine A review examines the role of mechanics in solid-state batteries and associated ways to improve performance and lifetime. BACKGROUND Solid-state batteries (SSBs) have important potential advantages over traditional Li-ion batteries used in everyday phones and electric vehicles. Among these potential advantages is higher energy density and faster charging. A solid electrolyte separator may also provide a longer lifetime, wider operating temperature, and increased safety due to the absence of flammable organic solvents. One of the critical aspects of SSBs is the stress response of their microstructure to dimensional changes (strains) driven by mass transport. The compositional strains in cathode particles occur in liquid electrolyte batteries too, but in SSBs these strains lead to contact mechanics problems between expanding or contracting electrode particles and solid electrolyte. On the anode side, plating of lithium metal creates its own complex stress state at the interface with the solid electrolyte. A critical feature of SSBs is that such plating can occur not only at the electrode\u2013electrolyte interface but within the solid electrolyte itself, inside its pores or along the grain boundaries. Such confined lithium deposition creates areas with high hydrostatic stress capable of initiating fractures in the electrolyte. Although the majority of failures in SSBs are driven by mechanics, most of the research has been dedicated to improving ion transport and electrochemical stability of electrolytes. As an attempt to bridge this gap, in this review we present a mechanics framework for SSBs and examine leading research in the field, focusing on the mechanisms by which stress is generated, prevented, and relieved. ADVANCES The push toward renewable resources requires the development of next-generation batteries with energy densities more than double that of current batteries and that can charge in 5 min or less. This has led to a race to develop electrolytes that can both facilitate 5-min fast charging and enable Li metal anodes\u2014the key to high energy. The discovery of solid electrolytes that have high electrochemical stability with Li metal and sulfide solid electrolytes with ionic conductivities greater than those of any liquid electrolyte have spurred a shift in the research community toward SSBs. Although these discoveries have seeded the promise that SSBs can enable the vision of fast charging and a doubling of energy density, realization of this promise is feasible only if the mechanical behavior of battery materials is thoroughly understood and multiscale mechanics is integrated in the development of SSBs. OUTLOOK Several key challenges must be addressed, including (i) nonuniform lithium plating on a solid electrolyte surface and deposition of lithium metal within the solid electrolyte; (ii) loss of interfacial contact within the cell as a result of the volume changes associated with the electrochemical cycling that occurs at electrode contacts and also at grain boundaries; and (iii) manufacturing processes to form SSBs with a very thin solid electrolyte and a minimum of inactive components, including binders and structural supports. Mechanics is a common denominator connecting these problems. Deposition of metallic lithium into the surface and volume defects of a ceramic solid electrolyte results in local high stresses that can lead to electrolyte fracture with further propagation of metallic lithium into the cracks. In manufacturing, as a minimum requirement, the cathode\u2013electrolyte stacks should possess enough strength to withstand the forces applied by the equipment. A better understanding of the mechanics of SSB materials will transfer to the development of solid electrolytes, cathodes, anodes, and cell architectures, as well as battery packs designed to manage the stresses of battery manufacturing and operation.

To achieve the SDG\u00a02030 agenda goal 12- \u201cEnsure sustainable consumption and production patterns,\u201d there is an urgent need to shift towards using toxic-free agricultural inputs. Various techniques are widely adopted to control weed growth and development, but farmers mostly rely on herbicide application. Nanotechnology-enabled herbicide formulations are more sustainable and efficient in weed control than traditional sources. The nanoherbicides enable lesser application frequency and minimum quantity requirement, thereby preventing herbicide accumulation in soil and water bodies. Mainly nano-mediated biodegradable carrier-based herbicides possess properties of prolonged release, targeted inhibition, reduced mobility in soil, better adhesion to the plant surface, and retards rapid degradation of active ingredients (AIs), which increase herbicide use efficiency against weeds. Biodegradable carrier materials are cost-effective and readily available from living/non-living organisms and mineral sources, which can be an alternate source for metal/metal-oxide carrier materials. Materials like chitosan, plant derivatives, clay particles, and synthetic polymers are notable carrier materials reported for encapsulating or loading herbicide molecules. Applying nano-mediated herbicides is an innovative methodology for controlling weeds while considering environmental safety. This review focused mainly on recent advances in biodegradable carrier-based herbicide application in agriculture to mitigate the crisis in sustainable weed management.

Incorporating PEG400 into the zein layer improved the interfacial compatibility of the bilayer film, increasing its uniformity and toughness. The resulting bilayer films demonstrated enhanced mechanical properties, flexibility, and water vapor barrier performance.

According to this aim, waste glass powder (WGP) was first used as a partial replacement for cement and six different ratios of WGP were utilized in concrete production: 0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50%. To examine the combined effect of different ratios of WGP on concrete performance, mixed samples (10%, 20%, 30%) were then prepared by replacing cement, and fine and coarse aggregates with both WGP and crashed glass particles. Workability and slump values of concrete produced with different amounts of waste glass were determined on the fresh state of concrete, and these properties were compared with those of plain concrete. For the hardened concrete, 150 mm \u00d7 150 mm \u00d7 150 mm cubic specimens and cylindrical specimens with a diameter of 100 mm and a height of 200 mm were tested to identify the compressive strength and splitting tensile strength of the concrete produced with waste glass. Next, a three-point bending test was carried out on samples with dimensions of 100 \u00d7 100 \u00d7 400 mm, and a span length of 300 mm to obtain the flexure behavior of different mixtures. According to the results obtained, a 20% substitution of WGP as cement can be considered the optimum dose. On the other hand, for concrete produced with combined WGP and crashed glass particles, mechanical properties increased up to a certain limit and then decreased owing to poor workability. Thus, 10% can be considered the optimum replacement level, as combined waste glass shows considerably higher strength and better workability properties. Furthermore, scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis was performed to investigate the microstructure of the composition. Good adhesion was observed between the waste glass and cementitious concrete. Lastly, practical empirical equations have been developed to determine the compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, and flexure strength of concrete with different amounts of waste glass.

The NA-modified concrete exhibited higher resistance to erosion by the sodium sulfate than ordinary concrete (OPC), the rate of reduction in its tensile strength was low, and the resistance of sample NA1 to penetration by chloride ions decreased only by one-fifth compared with that of OPC.

According to the mechanical test, including compression, splitting tensile, and flexural tests, the waste glass powder creates a better pozzolanic effect and increases the strength, while the glass particles tend to decrease the strength when they are swapped with aggregates. As observed in the splitting tensile test, noteworthy progress in the tensile strength of the concrete was achieved by 14%, while the waste glass used as a fractional replacement for the fine aggregate. In samples where glass particles were swapped with CA, the tensile strength tended to decrease.

Wet intake screens and lines support bacteria, plants, algae, and animals. BIOFouling jams screens and prevents water flow. It also causes corrosion and increases maintenance, reducing intake system performance. Mechanical cleaning, biocides, and antifouling coats treat biofouling. These solutions may work temporarily but harm the environment. Biocides can harm unintended sea creatures and render biofouling resistant. Sediment buildup troubles ocean intake systems. Intake channels and lines can acquire sea sand, silt, and organic garbage. Deposition reduces water flow cross-sectional area, making the device less efficient and more energy-intensive to pump. Sediment and wear can damage motor parts and increase maintenance expenses. Hard dredging and hand flushing may not remove all silt. Saltwater and air in the marine environment erode seawater intake system metals. System corrosion increases maintenance costs by weakening buildings and requiring additional repairs.

Robotic examinations pinpoint biofouling, silt, and corrosion maintenance sites. This reduces hand checks in dangerous spots and improves maintenance accuracy and speed. Innovative biofouling solutions include eco-friendly cleansers. These marine compounds degrade naturally and are harmless for all life. They eliminate biofilms and organic debris without harming other organisms. Cleaning products are evaluated in the lab and field to ensure efficacy and environmental safety. Maintenance with eco-friendly cleaning products is better for the environment than biocides. Ultrasonic cleaning safely removes biofilms and sediments from seawater-absorbing systems. Ultrasonic waves move debris, and water removes it. This method cleans surfaces well and reduces handwashing. Ultrasonic cleaning can be done regularly or continually depending on intake system needs. Combine it with other maintenance methods for optimum results. Integrating robotic scans, chemical sensors, and ultrasonic devices gives a complete intake system view. Advanced data analytics and prediction algorithms can detect biofouling, silt buildup, and corrosion early. Real-time monitoring and planning for planned maintenance via integrated monitoring systems improves efficiency and prevents breakdowns. Seawater intake systems will last longer and operate better with this precaution. These new inspection and cleaning methods have several benefits. Their reliability and efficiency ensure the seawater intake system functions effectively in critical industrial applications. Second, by using fewer chemicals and extending life, they reduce environmental impact. Third, they reduce manual inspections and cleanings in risky sea conditions, making personnel safer.

Among different kinds, cross\u2010linked AEMs enjoy the highest popularity, thanks to their uncomplicated fabrication procedures and outstanding stability. However, it is noteworthy that in the majority of instances, the employment of covalent cross\u2010linking methods often plunges AEMs into a conductivity\u2010stability conundrum. That is to say, when efforts are made to boost the conductivity, the stability tends to be compromised, and conversely, attempts to enhance stability might adversely affect conductivity. To tackle the conductivity\u2010stability issue faced by conventional covalent cross\u2010linked AEMs, within this research, innovative bifunctional imidazole cross\u2010linking agents that carry imidazole cations were synthesized using N\u2010(3\u2010aminopropyl)\u2010imidazole and 3\u2010chloropropylamine. Following that, these agents were then utilized to manufacture high\u2010performance cross\u2010linked quaternized chitosan (QCS) membranes. The bifunctional cross\u2010linker was able to furnish an ionic 3\u2010D network, further promoting the formation of microphase separation morphology and a densely cross\u2010linked structure, thereby bringing about both excellent conductivity and alkaline stability.

Despite the recognized importance of these compounds, our ability to determine their binding targets and toxicities remains a significant challenge. Predicting the target receptors of conotoxins, based solely on their amino acid sequence, remains a challenge due to the intricate relationships between structure, function, target specificity, and the significant conformational heterogeneity observed in conotoxins with the same primary sequence. We have previously demonstrated that the inclusion of post-translational modifications, collisional cross sections values, and other structural features, when added to the standard primary sequence features, improves the prediction accuracy of conotoxins against non-toxic and other toxic peptides across varied datasets and several different commonly used machine learning classifiers. Here, we present the effects of these features on conotoxin class and molecular target predictions, in particular, predicting conotoxins that bind to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). We also demonstrate the use of the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE)-Tomek in balancing the datasets while simultaneously making the different classes more distinct by reducing the number of ambiguous samples which nearly overlap between the classes.

In order to achieve efficient active targeting and ensuring a high efficacy of the treatment, CMCS was functionalized with Tet1 peptide, to target specific ear cells, and TAT peptide, to ensure cellular penetration.

However, the matching thickness and effective bandwidth of 2D microwave absorption films cannot satisfy the current application requirements. As a result, it is necessary to complete a rational structural design based on flat films. In view of the fact that common film-forming methods based on blocks or hard bases cannot be changed or replaced easily once the structural construction is done, here solvent evaporation molding combined with phase change material filling was proposed for the first time to accomplish continuous structural transformation for flexible films. Unlike the original reflection loss (RL) peaks of flat films at around 17.0 GHz, a new absorption peak near 12.25 GHz was generated thanks to the design of coherent structures, resulting in the peaks' boundary merging and effective bandwidth extension. Specifically, 4.56 GHz of absorption bandwidth (RL < -5 dB) at 1.0 mm and 4.27 GHz (RL < -10 dB) of absorption bandwidth at 2.3 mm could be obtained by arch testing under electrical field polarization. Importantly, correlations between EM field polarizations and coherent structures as well as the rules of the absorption peak generation and frequency shift related to the structural variation have all been figured out.

Compared with those established porous materials such as zeolites, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), and covalent-organic frameworks (COFs), it is much more difficult to stabilize HOFs and thus establish their permanent porosities given the fact that hydrogen bonds are typically weaker than ionic, coordination, and covalent bonds. But it provides the uniqueness of HOF materials in which they can be easily recovered and regenerated through simple recrystallization. HOF materials can also be easily and straightforwardly processed and very compatible with the biomolecules, making them potentially very useful materials for industrial and biomedical applications. The reversible and weak bonding nature of the hydrogen bonds can be readily utilized to construct flexible porous HOF materials in which we can tune the temperature and pressure to control their porosities and, thus, their diverse applications, for example, on gas separations, gas storage, drug delivery, and sensing. Some specific organic functional groups are quite directional for the hydrogen bond formations; for example, carboxylic acid prefers to form a directional dimer, which has enabled us to readily construct reticular porous HOF materials whose pores can be systematically tuned. In this Account, we outline our journey of exploring this new type of porous material by establishing one of the first porous HOFs in 2011 and thus developing its diverse applications. We have been able to use organic molecules with different functional sites, including 2,4-diaminotriazine (DAT), carboxylic acid (COOH), aldehyde (CHO), and cyano (CN), to construct porous HOFs.

This strategy has the advantage of minimizing off-target effects by restricting gene delivery to the desired cell population. However, the nanoplatform must guarantee both the local production of the protein and the safety of the treatment to allow an effective therapy with reduced systemic toxicity. Methods In order to ensure a selective delivery of nucleic acids, we developed poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)-poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) NPs loaded with an Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (EGFP)-coding plasmid and covalently coated with antiCD19 recombinant antibody as a targeting mechanism. To assess the functionality of the NPs, physicochemical characterization, safety tests, and transfection assay were employed to evaluate the NPs\u2019 behavior in vitro and in vivo, in a human/zebrafish lymphoma xenograft model. Results The results demonstrated that the PLGA-PVA nanoplatform was capable of efficiently encapsulating and releasing the payload. These nanostructures demonstrated a favorable safety profile, as evidenced by the absence of significant cell cytotoxicity, coagulation activation, complement system activation, and the slight activation of endothelial cells and leukocytes. The targeting mechanism facilitated the interaction of NPs with target cells, thereby enhancing their internalization and subsequent exogenous plasmid DNA (pDNA) translation and protein expression. In the human/zebrafish lymphoma xenograft model, no evidence of toxicity was observed, and targeted NPs demonstrated the capacity to enhance exogenous pDNA expression.

However, how the PCs adsorbed on NPs affect the particle-to-tumor cell interaction and their effect on the tumor biological behavior remain unclear. To better understand the formation of PCs following NPs exposure in the bloodstream under various clinical conditions, we investigated the PC compositions of NPs derived from thyroid cancer (TC) patients and healthy volunteers. Our data revealed a significant enrichment of fibrinogen in the PCs formed on NPs derived from TC patient plasma, which in turn accelerated the endocytosis of NPs into TC cells. In addition, the uptake pathway of NPs into TC cells differed substantially between the two groups studied due to the different PC compositions in cancer patients and healthy individuals. Moreover, intriguingly alterations in the PCs induced by the clinical pathology status were also found to promote NPs engulfment by human macrophages, resulting in potent pro-inflammatory effects, in turn exerting pro-tumor effects.

The variations in grain size, hardness, tensile strength, and toughness were systematically assessed using a series of experimental techniques. The experimental results indicate that the austenite grain size decreases from 14.8 \u03bcm to 5.0 \u03bcm as the number of cycles increases, accompanied by improved grain uniformity, which is beneficial to fine-grain strengthening mechanisms. During the phase transition, defects in the original martensite structure are transferred to the newly formed austenite, with the energy stored during the martensitic-to-austenitic transformation driving the grain refinement process.

The bones of the human and animal have a unique ability to remodel. The ability to constantly renew bone tissue determines the healing of fractures and the adaptation of bones to mechanical loads. However, the process of bone self-healing is effective only for defects of non-critical size. In segmental and critical defects, endogenous stimulation of bone tissue regeneration is required. In this regard, there remains a need to design osteoplastic biomaterials with improved pro-regenerative action. Every year, new data appear that expand our understanding of the methods and mechanisms for stimulating bone tissue restoration using artificial osteoplastic materials. \nAim. Characteristics of modern methods of constructing biomimetic materials from organic and mineral components of bone matrix. \nMaterials and methods. The literature review was conducted using the PubMed and ScienceDirect databases. Query dates \u2014 may\u2013july 2024, query depth \u2014 1965\u20132024. \nMain content of the review. Effective use of bone polymers for the creation of biomimetic osteoplastic materials is possible only with an understanding of the principles of molecular-cellular interaction of biopolymers with bone cells and tissues. By now, it has been established that the ability of collagen to influence the functional activity of cells involved in the reparative regeneration of bone tissue is due to the presence of special patterns in its structure - binding sites with cellular receptors, which are formed by a specific sequence of amino acids in the collagen polypeptide chain. In the case of inorganic bone material, the functionally significant elements are the chemical composition and crystal structure of calcium phosphate salts. A current trend in the design of osteoplastic materials is to impart biomimetic properties to them. At the molecular level, this approach is implemented using as intrafibrillar and extrafibrillar mineralization of collagen fibrils. At the tissue and organ level, biomimicry is achieved through the use of three-dimensional bioprinting technologies. \nConclusion. Thus, thanks to advances in biology, physics, chemistry and engineering sciences, it was possible to develop new technologies for designing osteoplastic materials that imitate the structure and function of native bone tissue.

The single-atom nanoagonist (SANA) is meticulously crafted by doping Mn atoms into defective molybdenum oxide (MoO3- x), enabling robust peroxidase-mimicking catalysis and inducing severe double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) damage in tumors. Of note, Mn2+ and MoO4 2- can be responsively released from Mn/MoO3- x SANA and enhance the sensitivity of cGAS to dsDNA. Importantly, MoO4 2- with a relatively slow-release profile and facile cellular accumulation compensates for Mn2+ that has poor cellular accumulation due to continuous efflux, thus continuatively triggering the secretion of type I interferon for beyond 72 h. Remarkably, Mn/MoO3- x SANA significantly inhibits tumor growth and metastasis without supplementary STING agonists or external stimulation.

Nevertheless, such strong electrostatic interaction between bivalent Mg2+ and crystalline cathode materials will lead to low capacity and poor diffusion kinetics, which seriously hinders the further development of magnesium-ion batteries. Herein, amorphization and anion-rich strategies are employed to prepare well-designed cathode materials with MoS3 anchored on hollow carbon nanospheres (a-MoS3/HCS). The amorphous MoS3 provides unrestricted 3D diffusion access and effectively boosts the Mg2+ diffusion kinetics, while the anion-rich feature of MoS3 offers rich active sites for Mg2+ storage and finally contributes to a high discharge capacity driven by the anionic redox mechanism. Moreover, the effective modification of hollow carbon nanospheres buffers the volumetric changes of MoS3 and improves the electron transfer efficiency. Owing to the above-mentioned multiple advantages, a-MoS3/HCS exhibits an ultrahigh discharge capacity (489.2 mAh g-1 at 50 mA g-1) and high cyclic performance (200.1 mAh g-1 at 2 A g-1 for 300 cycles), distinctly superior to those of crystalline 1T/2H-MoS2/HCS and 2H-MoS2/HCS and surpassing almost all of the molybdenum sulfide-based cathodes.

The classification of silicified wood as such deals with all the forms and phases of silica that come under its umbrella. One such class of silicified wood is fossil wood with a high content of quartz, and there are very limited mentions of this category of fossilized wood. The examined wood belongs to gymnosperm and comes from the Upper Triassic deposits of Madagascar. A fresh approach to such samples is adopted by studying the crystallographic texture of the fossil wood to understand the orientation of the crystals replacing the organic matter within the sample. This work focuses on crystallographic texture analysis based on pole figures measured by X-ray diffraction. The intensity of the pole density maxima on the pole figures measured on the heartwood surface part of the analyzed samples is higher than that on the sapwood. This affirms that the crystallographic texture is sharper at the heartwood part compared to the sapwood. The X-ray tomography study, conducted to understand the difference in mineral distribution within the sample, reveals a greater X-ray absorbing phase on the sapwood of both samples. This is due to the concentration of iron compounds, which both replace the remaining conductive structures of the wood and fill the cavities inside them.

However, achieving adjustable MML within a unified material framework is challenging due to the distinct responses of different luminescence modes to a common external stimulus. In the work, a novel approach is devised for regulating the aggregation or dispersion state of carbon dots (CDs) to exhibit responsive MML, including fluorescence (FL), room temperature phosphorescence (RTP), and chemiluminescence (CL). Specifically, aggregation\u2010caused luminescence quenching CDs (ACQCDs) are synthesized via a one\u2010step hydrothermal method using levofloxacin.

When ACQCDs interact with paper\u2010based materials, they form hydrogen bonds, establishing a high\u2010density hydrogen bond network that induces ACQCDs aggregation. Upon external stimulation, the hydrogen bond network undergoes dynamic changes, triggering ACQCDs dispersion. This process effectively deactivates nonradiative defect centers, stabilizes triplet excitons, and promotes simultaneous MML of tunable FL, RTP, and CL. The integration of multimodal luminescence with external stimulus input enables the creation of a programmable multi\u2010input logic gate, offering significant potential for encoded information anti\u2010counterfeiting applications.

CuxO deposition leads to lattice distortion of BMO NFs to improve piezoelectric response, and the strong interface electric field (IEF) suppresses PSE and increases piezopotential. The nonlocal piezopotential, local IEF, and glutathione (GSH) inoculation enhances electron-hole separation and increases peroxidase (POD)-like activity of BMO and GSH oxidase (GSHOx)-like activity of CuxO with high selectivity. The heterojunction formation causes the transfer and rearrangement of interface electrons, and the increased piezopotential accelerates electron transfer at interfaces with bacteria, thus increasing the production of reactive oxidative species and interfering with adenosine triphosphate synthesis. The heterostructured nanozymes produce abundant intracellular \u00b7OH and achieve 4log magnitude reductions in viable bacteria and effective biofilm dispersion.

At present, the main therapeutic modalities, such as local mechanical debridement and antibiotic delivery, are not only difficult to solve the intractable bacterial biofilm effectively but also tricky to ameliorate the excessive inflammatory response as well as regenerate the impaired periodontal tissues. Herein, we have proposed the TM/BHT/CuTA hydrogel system formed by the self-assembly of the copper-based nanozyme (copper tannic acid coordination nanosheets, CuTA NSs) and the triglycerol monostearate/2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol (TM/BHT) hydrogel. The negatively charged TM/BHT/CuTA can retain at the inflammation sites with a positive charge through electrostatic adsorption and hydrolyze in response to the increasing MMP of periodontitis, realizing the on-demand release of the CuTA nanozyme. The released CuTA nanozyme has antibacterial and antiplaque properties. Meanwhile, as a metal-phenolic nanozyme, it can scavenge multiple ROS by simulating the cascade process of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT). Further, the CuTA nanozyme can modulate the macrophage polarization from M1 phenotype to M2 phenotype through the Nrf2/NF-\u03baB pathway, which reduces the pro-inflammatory cytokines, increases the anti-inflammatory cytokines, and promotes the expression of osteogenetic genes successively, thus relieving the inflammation and accelerating the tissue regeneration of periodontitis.

A 1D carbon nanowire (FeNCP/NW) catalyst with enriched Fe\u2013N4 active sites is designed and synthesized, and P atoms are doped in the carbon matrix to affect the Fe center through long\u2010range interaction. The experimental results show that the P\u2010doping process can boost the POD\u2010like activity more than the non\u2010P\u2010doped one, with excellent selectivity and stability. The mechanism analysis results show that the introduction of P into SAC can greatly enhance POD\u2010like activity initially, but its effect becomes insignificant with increasing amount of P.

The 0.9 eV band gap of A5Al2O4 is narrower than the band gaps of all parent spinel oxides. First-principles calculations for multicomponent AAl2O4 spinels indicate that the band gap narrowing arises from the broadening of the energy distribution of the 3d states due to variations in the electronegativities and crystal field splitting across the 3d transition-metal series. As a catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction in an alkaline electrolyte, A5Al2O4 reaches a current density of 10 mA/cm2 at an overpotential of 400 mV, outperforming all of the single-metal end members at an applied potential of 1.7 V vs RHE.

Through advanced structural and electric field visualization studies, a novel quantitative relationship is established between atomic-level structural disorder-induced electric field polarization and macroscopic dielectric properties. The results indicate that the degree of atomic delocalization in perovskite oxides exhibits a near-parabolic trend with increasing entropy, reaching a maximum in medium-entropy perovskite.

It examines various wearable textiles equipped with sensors, actuators, and biofeedback mechanisms that monitor physiological indicators related to mood, such as the heart rate and skin conductivity. These technologies not only provide real-time feedback but also offer interactive elements, such as temperature regulation, light modulation, and tactile feedback, allowing users to actively engage with their emotional states. In addition, the integration of mobile applications allows users to track mood patterns and identify emotional triggers, thereby enhancing their self-awareness. In the end, through a synthesis of the current research, this review discusses the psychological impacts of these wearables, including their efficacy in stress reduction, anxiety management, and overall emotional resilience.

These advances in thermoregulatory clothing have focused on enhancing the control of heat dissipation between the skin and the localized environment. We primarily summarize research on advanced clothing that controls the heat dissipation pathways of the human body, such as radiation- and conductance-controlled clothing. Furthermore, adaptive clothing such as dual-mode textiles, which can regulate the microclimate of the human body, as well as responsive textiles that address both thermal performance (warming and/or cooling) and wearability are discussed.

To address this issue, herein, a PS named BDTP with aggregation\u2010induced emission properties was developed.

In dark conditions, BDTP functions as an antibiotic, inhibiting bacterial proliferation. Upon white light stimulation, BDTP can induce phototoxic damage to the DNA of V. vulnificus and effectively inhibit/clear V. vulnificus biofilms. Additionally, the eukaryotic cell membrane barrier significantly reduces PS\u2010induced damage to its nucleic acids.

Since FRP is considered very robust with few requirements concerning monomer purity, it is still interesting to investigate how itaconate FRP may become feasible. For this reason, copolymerizations of itaconates with other monomers well-suited for FRP are considered. In particular, copolymerization with acrylates appears to be interesting because the propagation rate of these monomers is high and depropagation is not operative at common polymerization temperatures.

Microneedle technology has emerged as a prominent area of focus in biomedical research because of its ability to deliver a wide range of biomolecules, vaccines, medicines, and other substances through the skin. Microneedles (MNs) form microchannels by disrupting the skin\u2019s structure, which compromises its barrier function, and facilitating the easy penetration of drugs into the skin. These devices enhance the administration of many therapeutic substances to the skin, enhancing their stability. Transcutaneous delivery of medications using a microneedle patch offers advantages over conventional drug administration methods. Microneedles containing active substances can be stimulated by different internal and external factors to result in the regulated release of the substances. To achieve efficient drug administration to the desired location, it is necessary to consider the design of needles with appropriate optimized characteristics. The choice of materials for developing and manufacturing these devices is vital in determining the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of drug delivery. This article provides the most recent update and overview of the numerous microneedle systems that utilize different activators to stimulate the release of active components from the microneedles. Further, it discusses the materials utilized for producing microneedles and the design strategies important in managing the release of drugs. An explanation of the commonly employed fabrication techniques in biomedical applications and electronics, particularly for integrated microneedle drug delivery systems, is discussed. To successfully implement microneedle technology in clinical settings, it is essential to comprehensively assess several factors, such as biocompatibility, drug stability, safety, and production cost.

Since the proposal of the bulk heterojunction concept by Heeger et al. in 1995, conjugated polymer/fullerene pairs have gradually emerged as the optimal choice for active layer materials in OSCs. Fullerene derivatives were preferred as electron acceptors in OSCs because of their high electron mobility. However, due to limitations such as insufficient light absorption, limited derivative potential, and poor energy level tunability, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs based on fullerene derivatives has encountered a bottleneck of approximately 12%, despite the continuous updates in polymer donor materials over nearly two decades of development, leading to a gradual decline in their importance. By contrast, nonfullerene electron acceptors (NFAs) have gradually gained dominance in this field since first appearing in 2015, thanks to their advantages of tunable absorption spectrum, adjustable energy levels, and modifiable chemical structure. Among nonfullerene acceptors, fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs) such as ITIC and Y6 have achieved significant progress, boosting the PCE of OSCs to 20%. This milestone achievement indicates the potential of their commercial applications. However, the synthesis process of FREA is complex and often constrained by low-yield ring-closure reactions, resulting in high costs.The molecular backbone of nonfused ring electron acceptors (NFREAs) is composed of single bonds, which enables the adoption of modular synthesis mainly via Stille (based on organotin reactant) and/or Suzuki (based on organoboron reactant) coupling or C-H activation (without prefunctionalization) and avoids low-yield ring-closing reactions, thus making them a potential alternative to fused-ring acceptors. To achieve a planar molecular backbone and minimize energy loss due to conformational rotation, our team innovatively used intramolecular noncovalent interactions as a replacement for traditional covalent bonds. Furthermore, to address the issues of poor solubility and excessive aggregation during film formation for NFREAs, we strategically introduced sterically hindered side groups, such as 2,6-bis(alkyloxy)phenyl and diphenylamino, into the molecular design, effectively mitigating these problems. These innovative design concepts have significantly advanced the development of high-performance NFREAs and have garnered increasing attention from the research community. The PCEs of OSCs based on NFREAs have significantly improved from less than 10% to close to 20% since their initial discovery. By optimizing the device fabrication process, we have achieved a PCE of over 19%, which is comparable to that of FREAs.

In this field of study, the present research aims to evaluate the feasibility of using corn straw fiber for the production of innovative cementitious composites. Mortars with a composition of 1:1:6:1.55 (cement/lime/sand/water) containing 0, 2.5 and 5% corn straw fiber were produced. The corn straw fibers were treated with three different alkaline products: sodium hydroxide (NaOH), potassium hydroxide (KOH) and calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2). The compositions were evaluated by means of compressive strength, water absorption, density and porosity and consistency tests. Characterization tests were also carried out on the natural fibers subjected to the different treatments, where it was observed that chemical characterization revealed an increase in crystalline cellulose from 59.03% to 63.50% (NaOH), 62.41% (KOH) and 60.40% (Ca(OH)2), which enhances fiber strength. In the mortars, it was observed that the water absorption results were reduced when the alkaline treatments were used, reducing from 15.95% (composition without fibers) to 6.34% and 6.61% in the compositions with 2.5% and 5.0% of fibers treated with KOH, for example. The effects were also positive in the compositions with fibers treated in NaOH, where the water absorption values were 7.59% and 7.88% for the compositions containing 2.5% and 5.0% of treated fiber, respectively. Alkaline treatments also promote an increase in compressive strength when comparing the results of mortars with natural fibers and fibers treated with NaOH, for example. The result for mortars containing 5.0% untreated fibers was 0.22 MPa, while for the composition containing 5.0% fibers treated with NaOH, it was 3.79 MPa, an increase of more than 15x. This behavior is justified by the effect of the treatment, which, in addition to removing impurities from natural fibers, such as sugar, increases the crystalline cellulose content and the adhesion between fiber and matrix. Based on the results obtained, it is possible to conclude that (i) the treatment with NaOH increases the crystallinity and tensile strength of the fibers, promoting good properties for innovative cementitious composites; (ii) the treatment with KOH degrades the cellulose structure of the fiber, reducing the crystallinity and tensile strength; this promotes greater adhesion of the fiber to the matrix, reducing porosity and water absorption, but promotes a reduction in compressive strength when compared to composites with 2.5% natural fiber; and (iii) the treatment with Ca(OH)2 presents a reduction in water absorption and porosity, due to the impregnation of calcium in the fiber that improves the adhesion between fiber and matrix.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-11-28", "synthetic_support_claim": "Treatment with NaOH increases corn straw fiber crystallinity and tensile strength, improving cementitious composite properties.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Corn straw fiber improves the environmental sustainability of cementitious composites more than other natural fibers."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "f7d5f229c599d396c4e0e21f88ae7e737c5c75a3", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f7d5f229c599d396c4e0e21f88ae7e737c5c75a3", "title": "Synergistic effects of thermoplastic starch and nanofibrillated cellulose on the mechanical, thermal, and micromorphological properties of polylactic acid composites", "abstract": "Filling and reinforcing highly brittle and costly polylactic acid (PLA) with nanocellulose and starch has been found to be a promising approach for practical applications.

Specifically, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and chitosan quaternary ammonium (HACC) are used, as PVA benefits from salting-out effects and HACC undergoes ion coordination with multivalent anions. After just 1 h of immersion in an anionic solution, the hydrogel undergoes a dramatic improvement in mechanical properties, increasing by more than three orders of magnitude. The optimized hydrogel achieves high strength (26 MPa), a high Young's modulus (45 MPa), and remarkable fracture toughness (67.3 kJ m-2), representing enhancements of 860, 3200, and 1200 times, respectively, compared to its initial state.

Additionally, the homogeneity and mechanical stability of SEI ensure the crystallographic reorientation of Zn anodes from Zn(101) to (002) planes, efficiently inhibiting dendrite growth and metal corrosion during the Zn2+ stripping/plating process. These advantages significantly enhance the stability of the Zn anode, as demonstrated by the prolonged cycling lifespan of symmetric Zn batteries and exceptional reversibility (>99.5%) over 5000 cycles in Zn//Cu asymmetric batteries. Notably, this strategy also enables the stable operation of anode-free Zn//I2 batteries with a long lifespan of 3000 cycles.

Unlike fluorescence, it shows a long emission lifetime (\u223c\u03bcs), large Stokes shift, and rich excited state properties, attracting considerable attention in organic electronics during the past years. Ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP), a type of persistent luminescence in organic phosphors, shows an emission lifetime of over 100 ms normally according to the resolution limit of the naked eye. According to the Jablonski energy diagram, two prerequisites are necessary for UOP generation and enhancement. One is to promote intersystem crossing (ISC) of the excitons from the excited singlet to triplet states by enhancing the spin-orbit coupling (SOC); the other is to suppress the nonradiative transitions of the excitons from the excited triplet states.In this Account, we will give a summary of our research on ultralong organic phosphorescence, including the design of materials, manipulation of properties, fabrication of nano/microstructures, and function applications. First, we give a brief introduction to the UOP development. Then, we discuss the constructed methods of UOP materials from the inter/intramolecular interaction types, including \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions, intermolecular hydrogen bonds, halogen bonds, ionic bonds, covalent bonds, and so on. These effective interactions can build a rigid environment to restrain the nonradiative transitions from the molecular motions or external quenching by oxygen, moisture, or heat, and thus enhance the UOP performance. Next, the manipulation of UOP properties, containing excitation wavelength, emission colors, lifetimes, and quantum efficiency (QE), through molecular or crystal engineering will be summarized. Recently, the excitation wavelengths of the materials for UOP can be regulated in different regions, such as UV, visible light, and X-ray; the emission colors of UOP can cover the whole visible-light region, from deep blue to red; the phosphorescence lifetime of UOP materials can reach 2.5 s, and the quantum efficiency can be achieved up to 96.5%. Moreover, we will present the fabrication of micro/nanoscale UOP materials, including the preparation of micro/nanostructure, optical performance, and device fabrication.

Description Editor\u2019s summary Certain fluoropolymers have ferroelectric properties and attractive mechanical properties for a wide range of applications. Qian et al. review the history of these polymers and discuss recent progress, focusing on their potential use in electromechanical, electrocaloric, and dielectric applications. Fluoropolymers are relatively flexible, making these materials attractive for a wide range of applications, including wearable devices. Many challenges remain for improving the properties of these materials for commercial applications. \u2014Brent Grocholski A review explains that polymer ferroelectrics are attractive materials for electromechanical, electrocaloric, and dielectric applications. BACKGROUND Polymeric ferroelectrics are distinguished by their high pliability, easy fabrication into complicated shapes, mechanical robustness, and polar active nature. Ferroelectricity in polymers was discovered around the 1970s in poly(vinylidene fluoride), which has served as a platform for efficient cross-coupling between electrical, mechanical, and thermal energies. Such ferroelectric soft materials and their polar active derivatives undergo a change in electrical polarization in response to general forces (mechanical stresses or temperature changes) and vice versa, enabling a series of physical effects, including piezoelectric and electrostriction, electrocaloric and pyroelectric, and a variety of dielectric and ferroelectric effects. These multifunctional polymeric materials are suitable for many different applications in portable, miniaturized, and wearable electroactive devices applied at human\u2013machine interfaces because of their easy processability into thin, light, tough, and pliable films and fibers. ADVANCES Polymer ferroelectrics have exhibited marked improvements in electromechanical coupling efficiency, electrostrictive strain, electrocaloric heat-pumping capability, and lifetime, which have substantially boosted the development of practical applications based on these polar soft materials owing to the facile application of defects in tuning and controlling the polarization processes at the monomeric, macromolecular, and morphological structure levels. For the first time, the piezoelectric and electromechanical coupling factors of fluorinated alkyne (FA)\u2013modified relaxor ferroelectric tetrapolymers have surpassed those of lead zirconate titanate (PZT) piezoceramics, the presently most widely used piezoceramics in the world. Coupled with the progressive 4% electrostrictive strain under a low electrical field of 50 MV/m, this advancement represents a step forward in developing efficient wearable sensory and haptic devices and soft robots. Additionally, advances in ferroelectric-based electrocaloric polymers have led to large electrocaloric cooling of >7.5 K under ultralow electric fields without fatigue. These ferroelectric polymers can offer customized, energy-efficient solutions to curb the CO2 emissions of current commercial heat pumps, air conditioners (ACs), and refrigerators, which are responsible for 60% of building emissions. In addition, the most recently reported electroactive fabrics demonstrate versatile strategies for integrating these polymer ferroelectrics at human\u2013machine interfaces in this envisioned low-carbon society. OUTLOOK Understanding and then tailor-making the structures and polarization responses of polymeric ferroelectrics to obtain respective functionalities are critical for the development of these polymeric systems. Given their rich underlying chemistry, FA-modified relaxor ferroelectric polymers are likely still in their infancy. Defect modifications on the molecular scale provide a plethora of methods to manipulate the polar structures and field-induced phase transitions on demand. Considering the vast pool of monomers and nanoscale extrinsic inclusions that can be selected, defect modification in polymer ferroelectrics remains largely unexplored and holds great possibility for contributing to green, smart, and meta lifestyles. Further identifying and understanding the various polarization mechanisms and processes for each functionality at multiple scales will be accomplished by utilizing the current advanced, in situ characterization and simulation tools at our disposal. For different cross-couplings and correlated applications, materials should be fine-tuned to exhibit their respective collection of optimized properties. Several mutual challenges should be addressed, including realizing low-field operation, a long lifetime, viable strategies for integration and mass production, and so on. Considering the commercially available processes for polymeric films, multilayer capacitors, fibers, and fabrics, these flexible ferroelectrics are expected to play a key role in haptic, sensory, and robotic applications in the metaverse, serve as a solid-state refrigerant for flat-panel and/or wearable ACs, and provide a broad range of localized, bodily sensations and tactile effects currently unavailable on the market.

Among different piezoelectrically active polymers, poly(vinylidene fluoride) and its copolymers have attracted considerable attention for energy conversion due to their high flexibility, thermal stability, and biocompatibility. However, the orientation of polymer chains for self-poling under mild conditions is still a challenging task. Herein, anisotropic poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-trifluoroethylene) (PVDF-TrFE)/MXene aerogel-based piezoelectric generators with highly oriented MXene fillers are fabricated. The unidirectional freezing of a hybrid solution facilitates the strain-induced alignment of MXene nanosheets and polymer chains along the solvent crystal growth direction due to the robust interactions between the MXene nanosheets (O-H/F groups) and PVDF-TrFE chains (F-C/C-H groups). Consequently, this process fosters the development of abundant electroactive \u03b2 crystals with preferred alignment characteristics, leading to the formation of intrinsic self-oriented dipoles within the PVDF-TrFE aerogel. As a result, the piezoelectric properties of PVDF-TrFE are fully harnessed without any complex poling process, resulting in an open-circuit voltage of around 40 V with MXene loading of 3 wt % in anisotropic aerogel, which is 2-fold higher than that of the corresponding isotropic aerogel where the MXene nanosheets and polymer chains are randomly aligned.

However, rational design of the GOR electrocatalyst with an explicit structure-property relationship remains a challenge. In this study, by using cobalt chalcogenides as model catalysts, we performed an in-depth study of the GOR catalytic mechanism of CoS and CoSe nanosheets. Experimental and theoretical results revealed that the reaction pathway on cobalt chalcogenides strongly depends on their binding energy to hydroxyl (OHBE). For CoS with a weak OHBE, the reaction proceeds through an \"electrophilic oxygen\" route. While for CoSe, due to the strong OHBE, a surface reconstruction occurs before the GOR and therefore follows the \"electrochemical-chemical\" route. Inspired by these findings, a customized strategy was proposed to regulate the OHBE of the catalysts, which involved introducing F atoms into CoS to enhance its OHBE, and weakening the OHBE of CoSe by doping with Zn atoms. The optimized F-doped CoS and Zn-doped CoSe catalysts both exhibited significantly improved performance for GOR.

Owing to the difference in the reactivity of the isocyanate groups and the gradual deblocking of aldimine, asynchronous cross-linking of hexamethylene diisocyanate and isocyanate-terminated prepolymer containing dynamic oxime-urethane bonds with the deblocked tris(2-aminoethyl)amine facilitates the transition from the molecular interpenetration of chains into immiscible polymerization.

Furthermore, the supramolecular interactions between hyperbranched clusters and dynamic oxime-urethane bonds enable the network with excellent recyclability.

OML demonstrated pronounced inhibitory benefits via increasing the corrosion resistance of mild steel in the corrosive HCl solution, thus reducing the corrosion rate to 0.11 mg cm\u22122 h\u22121 and increasing the inhibition efficiency to 87.1% at an inhibitor concentration of 500 ppm. PDP confirmed that the inhibitor works as a mixed-type inhibitor with cathodic supremacy. EIS revealed that the charge transfer mechanism is the main controlling factor for the corrosion process. The thermodynamic parameters suggested a key role of OML physisorption in inhibition, following the Langmuir isotherm. Importantly, SEM and EDX analyses suggested the formation of a protective layer of the extract onto the steel surface, which shields the surface from corrosive species. This is owed to the functional group-rich phytochemicals of OML. Therefore, the development of bio-based corrosion inhibitors is not only a step towards more eco-friendly industrial practices, but also meets the growing demand for sustainable materials in a world with constrained resources.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-01-01", "synthetic_support_claim": "Marjoram essential oil inhibits mild steel corrosion in 1 M HCl with 87.1% efficiency at 500 ppm.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "OML provides similar corrosion inhibition on aluminum surfaces in acidic environments."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "259e0f4bc1a8068715c09bb5782eb1f6dd00e067", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/259e0f4bc1a8068715c09bb5782eb1f6dd00e067", "title": "Processes of Electrospun Polyvinylidene Fluoride-Based Nanofibers, Their Piezoelectric Properties, and Several Fantastic Applications", "abstract": "Since the third scientific and technological revolution, electronic information technology has developed rapidly, and piezoelectric materials that can convert mechanical energy into electrical energy have become a research hotspot.

These membranes were created through electrospinning using piezoelectric polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) composites, which contained 1 wt.% and 3 wt.% of copper-impregnated nanohydroxyapatite (Cu-nHA).

The pseudo-second-order kinetic model described both organic dyes' adsorption on synthesized adsorbents. Accordingly, the calculated adsorption capacities of Congo Red (CR) and Malachite Green (MG) dyes over the synthesized adsorbents were found to be about 22.72 and 49.02\u2009mg/g for pure EV, 100 and 100\u2009mg/g for pure ZIF-67, 90.91 and 100\u2009mg/g for ZIF-67/EV-2, 100 and 100\u2009mg/g for ZIF-67/EV-5, 95.24 and 99.01\u2009mg/g for ZIF-67/EV-7, and 92.59 and 97.09\u2009mg/g for ZIF-67/EV-10, respectively.

Pineapple juice, containing bromelain with a protease activity of 16.40 \u00b5g/mL\u00b7min, effectively removed 22% of sericin from raw silk using a liquid ratio of 30:1 at pH 7 and 60 \u00b0C for 60 min. Unlike alkaline degumming, which weakened silk fibers (maximum load 6.18 \u00b1 1.56 N), pineapple juice-treated silk retained higher strength (maximum load 7.80 \u00b1 1.32 N), offering a gentler alternative. The remaining pineapple pulp, after juice extraction, was processed into a porous adsorbent with a surface area of 3.63 m2/g and a pore size of 6.15 nm. This material absorbed acid dyes effectively at pH 5, the normal pH used in the acid dyeing of silk.

Herein, the phase conversion paths of both film- and powder-type WS2 anodes are investigated in lithium-ion batteries. It is found that the reversible conversion mechanism is beneficial for alleviating the shuttle effect through strong W-LixSy bonding. Also, once the size of the phase-converted W/WS2 redox pair exceeds \u223c10 nm inside the anode layer, the Li+ storage ability will severely decay due to uncontrollable W precipitation. To maintain high reversibility, amorphous Al2O3 is introduced upon pristine WS2.

Davis led an independent research program from 1981 to 2023, beginning at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (VPI) and then transitioning to the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). His research program was marked by exceptional creativity, breadth, and depth. With classical training in reaction engineering, Davis developed expertise in experimental heterogeneous catalysis and led work in this discipline for more than 40 years. His name is synonymous with zeolites, and today, he is one of the most widely recognized experts in zeolite synthesis, characterization, and catalysis in the world. Early work at the VPI focused on zeolites and catalysis with supported metal coordination complexes. His creativity was evident at the earliest stages of his career, with the development of supported aqueous phase catalysts and the world\u2019s first crystalline, extra-large pore molecular sieve, both reported in the late 1980s. A move to Caltech saw a significant expansion of his zeolite synthesis program and the rapid acceleration of a multidecade collaboration with Dr. Stacey I. Zones of Chevron. At Caltech, his work expanded to include studies of molecular recognition and catalysis with organic/inorganic hybrid materials, and he developed a large, parallel program in drug delivery. His work on catalysis heavily emphasized zeolite catalysis, including major thrusts on the conversion of sugars in the liquid phase and methanol in the gas phase. Numerous new zeolites and molecular sieves were discovered throughout the four decades of the Davis laboratory, highlighted by a successful, multidecade quest to prepare a chiral zeolite with enantioselective catalytic properties. Davis is one of the most decorated researchers of the last four decades. He is one of only 21 living people currently elected to all of the US National Academies (Engineering, Science, Medicine) and elected as a Fellow of the National Academy of Inventors.

In this work, a new pillared-MOF@NiV-LDH nanocomposite based on a CoII metal-organic framework (pillared-MOF) and heterometallic Ni/V-layered double hydroxide (NiV-LDH) was assembled via a simple protocol, characterized, and explored as an electrocatalyst in OER. A remarkable electrocatalytic efficiency of pillared-MOF@NiV-LDH in 1 M KOH is evidenced by a low overpotential (238 mV at 10 mA cm-2 current density) and a small value of the Tafel slope (62 mV dec-1). These parameters are very close to those of the reference IrO2 electrocatalyst and are superior to the majority of the LDH- and MOF-based systems previously applied for OER. Excellent stability of pillared-MOF@NiV-LDH was confirmed by the chronopotentiometry tests for 70 h and linear-sweep voltammetry after 7000 cycles. Features such as rich electroactive sites, porous structure, high surface area, and synergic effect between pillared-MOF and NiV-LDH are likely responsible for the remarkable electrocatalytic efficiency of this electrocatalyst in OER.

Isolated atom site catalysts (IASCs) have been developed as an ideal system to precisely regulate the oxidation state and coordination environment of single-metal centers, and thus optimize their catalytic property. The isolated metal sites in IASCs inherently possess a positive oxidation state, and can be more readily produce homogeneous high-valence active sites under oxidative potentials than their nanoparticle counterparts.

Methods: A systematic review of oxidised resorbable cellulose (ORC)-induced pseudotumours of the head and neck was conducted following PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Articles were retrieved from PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, and Web of Science. Two ORC-induced pseudotumour cases from the Maxillofacial Surgery Department of Verona are also presented. Results: In most cases, pseudotumours were monitored using ultrasound. Further investigations included CT, MRI, PET-CT, and scintigraphy. Ultrasound images showed stable, elongated, and non-homogeneous masses. In CT scans, pseudotumours showed a liquefied core, and none or only peripheral enhancement. In MRI, pseudotumours presented none or only peripheral enhancement, and a heterogeneous pattern in T2-weighted images. 18-FDG PET scans demonstrated an FDG-avid mass (SUV 7.5). Scintigraphy was inconclusive. Cytology indicated a granulomatous reaction without neoplastic cells. Where surgical excision was performed, a granulomatous reaction with the presence of oxidised cellulose fibres was confirmed. Conclusions: Surgeons should consider artifacts from retained oxidised absorbable haemostatic material when suspecting tumour recurrence or metastasis on postoperative imaging, especially if certain features are present. Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is a useful diagnostic tool, but surgical excision may be needed if FNAC is inconclusive or impractical.

It is designed to be used when conventional hemostatic methods, such as compression or ligation, fail to adequately control capillary, venous, or arterial bleeding. This study aims to assess the hemostatic efficacy of AHA in two formulations\u2014powder and liquid\u2014using a rat tail transection model.\nMaterials and Methods: This study included 24 Wistar Albino rats aged 10\u201312 weeks and weighing 250\u2013280 g, which were randomly divided into three experimental groups (n = 8/group): 1) AHA powder, 2) AHA liquid-impregnated gauze-sponge, and 3) control (treated with a physiological saline-soaked sponge). A standardized tail transection procedure was performed on each rat to induce bleeding. Immediately following the transection, the designated treatment for each group was applied directly to the hemorrhage site. Bleeding cessation was assessed at 20-second intervals, and if bleeding persisted, the application was repeated for up to two additional attempts. Hemostasis was considered unsuccessful if bleeding continued after three consecutive applications of the assigned treatment.\nResults: Significantly shorter bleeding times were observed in both AHA-treated groups compared to the control group. None of the rats in the control group achieved hemostasis following three applications of the physiological saline-soaked sponge. In the AHA powder group, all 8 rats (100%) achieved hemostasis within the first 20 seconds of the initial application. In the AHA liquid-impregnated gauze-sponge group, 6 out of 8 rats (75%) achieved hemostasis after the first application, while the remaining 2 rats (25%) stopped bleeding after the second application. Statistical analysis revealed a significant difference between the control group and the two AHA-treated groups (p < 0.0001).\nConclusions: These findings demonstrate the potential of AHA as a reliable hemostatic agent in both surgical settings and emergency situations where traditional methods are insufficient to control bleeding effectively.

This study investigates the potential of Posidonia oceanica, an abundant marine biomass, which is often driven to be stacked on the backshore and used so far for energy recovery and low-value applications, as a filler and possible reinforcement in cementitious and polymer composites. Most applications of Posidonia are concentrated in the Mediterranean area and focused on the construction industry. However, its introduction in polymer composites, especially as a source of cellulose or in combination with the use of bio-based matrices, can also be proposed. With this aim, the physical and chemical properties of Posidonia oceanica fibers need to be characterized, and their compatibility with various matrices needs to be evaluated. Experimental results demonstrate that Posidonia oceanica fibers, especially when treated with alkali and silane, or combining both treatments, can exhibit mechanical properties quite comparable to other natural fibers, namely to those obtained from grass species. As with any other type of waste, yet with more interest for its wide accumulation over the coastal line, the use of Posidonia oceanica in composites may contribute to reducing the environmental footprint of these materials, aligning with circular economy principles.
