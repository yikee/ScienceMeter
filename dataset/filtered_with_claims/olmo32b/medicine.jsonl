Readdressing this absence, this paper examines the health narratives told by spinal injured men and the work narratives do on, in, and for them. Methods: In-depth life history interviews and fieldwork observations with men (n=17) who sustained a spinal injury through playing sport and are now disabled were conducted. Qualitative data were analyzed using a dialogical narrative analysis. Results: Stories told about health characterized a style of embodied actions choices that anticipated a certain type of narrative, that is, an emergent narrative. The men\u2019s narrative habitus, fashioned through the process rehabilitation, predisposed them to be interpellated to care about health. To uphold hegemonic masculinities the men also did not care too much about health. The analysis also reveals the work narratives do on, in, and for health behavior, masculine identities, resilience, leisure time physical activity, and body-self relationships. Implications for health promotion work are highlighted. Conclusions: The paper advances knowledge by revealing the emergent narrative of health. It reveals too for the first time the way certain contexts and masculine identities create a new subject of health that cares about doing health work, but not too much.

Key statistics on zoonoses and zoonotic agents in humans, food, animals and feed are provided and interpreted historically. In 2021, the first and second most reported zoonoses in humans were campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis, respectively. Cases of campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis increased in comparison with 2020, but decreased compared with previous years. In 2021, data collection and analysis at the EU level were still impacted by the COVID\u201019 pandemic and the control measures adopted in the MSs, including partial or total lockdowns. Sixteen MSs and the United Kingdom (Northern Ireland) achieved all the established targets in poultry populations for reduction in Salmonella prevalence for the relevant serovars. Salmonella samples from carcases of various animal species and samples for Campylobacter quantification from broiler carcases were more frequently positive when performed by the competent authorities than when own\u2010checks were conducted. Yersiniosis was the third most reported zoonosis in humans, followed by Shiga toxin\u2010producing Escherichia coli (STEC) and Listeria monocytogenes infections. L. monocytogenes and West Nile virus infections were the most severe zoonotic diseases, with the most hospitalisations and highest case fatality rates. Overall, MSs reported more foodborne outbreaks and cases in 2021 than in 2020. S. Enteritidis remained the most frequently reported causative agent for foodborne outbreaks.

We screened a group of fungal lectins and protease inhibitors from different fungal species, protein folds and known targets for their antibacterial and antibiofilm activity against model strains of Listeria innocua and Listeria monocytogenes. Several of them significantly decreased the viability of biofilm bacteria, but had no effect on bacterial growth parameters at 37\u00b0C and thus had no antibacterial activity. Fungal lectins significantly impaired biofilm development even at room temperature, which was attributed to exposure to lectins during adhesion.

Primary efficacy end points were time to disease progression and best confirmed response rate. On disease progression, patients in the control arm had the option to receive single-agent bevacizumab 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks. RESULTS Compared with the control arm, treatment with carboplatin and paclitaxel plus bevacizumab (15 mg/kg) resulted in a higher response rate (31.5% v 18.8%), longer median time to progression (7.4 v 4.2 months) and a modest increase in survival (17.7 v 14.9 months). Of the 19 control patients that crossed over to single-agent bevacizumab, five experienced stable disease, and 1-year survival was 47%.

It updates the CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain \u2014 United States, 2016 (MMWR Recomm Rep 2016;65[No. RR-1]:1\u201349) and includes recommendations for managing acute (duration of <1 month), subacute (duration of 1\u20133 months), and chronic (duration of >3 months) pain. The recommendations do not apply to pain related to sickle cell disease or cancer or to patients receiving palliative or end-of-life care. The guideline addresses the following four areas: 1) determining whether or not to initiate opioids for pain, 2) selecting opioids and determining opioid dosages, 3) deciding duration of initial opioid prescription and conducting follow-up, and 4) assessing risk and addressing potential harms of opioid use. CDC developed the guideline using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. Recommendations are based on systematic reviews of the scientific evidence and reflect considerations of benefits and harms, patient and clinician values and preferences, and resource allocation. CDC obtained input from the Board of Scientific Counselors of the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (a federally chartered advisory committee), the public, and peer reviewers. CDC recommends that persons with pain receive appropriate pain treatment, with careful consideration of the benefits and risks of all treatment options in the context of the patient\u2019s circumstances. Recommendations should not be applied as inflexible standards of care across patient populations. This clinical practice guideline is intended to improve communication between clinicians and patients about the benefits and risks of pain treatments, including opioid therapy; improve the effectiveness and safety of pain treatment; mitigate pain; improve function and quality of life for patients with pain; and reduce risks associated with opioid pain therapy, including opioid use disorder, overdose, and death.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-11-04", "synthetic_support_claim": "CDC recommends appropriate pain treatment, considering benefits and risks of treatment options based on patient circumstances.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "\"Cannabinoids are a safe and effective alternative to opioids for managing chronic pain in adults.\""}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "8cf0501f0c4c3bc9f2ed9a8ca601af0bc1ff755c", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8cf0501f0c4c3bc9f2ed9a8ca601af0bc1ff755c", "title": "Association Between Spinal Manipulation, Butalbital Prescription, and Medication Overuse Headache in Adults With Tension\u2010Type Headache: Retrospective Cohort Study", "abstract": "ABSTRACT Background and Aims Butalbital is an acute headache medication commonly prescribed for tension\u2010type headache (TTH), although discouraged by guidelines due to a risk of medication overuse headache (MOH). Considering spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) may reduce TTH frequency and intensity, we hypothesized adults with TTH receiving chiropractic SMT would be less likely to receive a butalbital prescription over 2 years versus matched controls not receiving SMT. We secondarily compared likelihood of MOH between cohorts. Methods We searched a United States medical records database of patients attending academic medical centers for adults with TTH, from 2013 to 2024, excluding those diagnosed with other headaches and seen in inpatient/emergency settings. We divided patients into two cohorts: (1) SMT and (2) non\u2010SMT, using propensity matching to control for demographics and other variables associated with likelihood of butalbital prescription and MOH. Results Three thousand one hundred and sixteen patients remained per cohort after matching. The incidence of butalbital prescription was lower in the SMT cohort compared to the non\u2010SMT cohort (SMT: 1.7%; non\u2010SMT: 3.8%), yielding an RR (95% CI) of 0.46 (0.33\u20130.63; p\u2009<\u20090.001).

However, a better understanding of the relationship between bacterial genetic markers, phenotypic resistance, and clinical outcomes is needed. We performed whole-genome sequencing on five medically important pathogens (Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) to investigate how resistance genes impact patient outcomes. A total of 168 isolates from 162 patients with Gram-negative infections admitted to Beilinson Hospital at Rabin Medical Center in Israel were included for final analysis. Genomes were analyzed for resistance determinants and correlated with microbiologic and clinical data. Thirty-day mortality from time of culture was 26.5% (43/162). Twenty-nine patients had carbapenem-resistant isolates (29/168, 17.2%), while 63 patients had multidrug-resistant isolates (63/168, 37.5%). Albumin levels were inversely associated with mortality and length of stay, while arrival from a healthcare facility and cancer chemotherapy predicted having a multidrug-resistant isolate. Sequencing revealed possible patient-to-patient transmission events. blaCTX-M-15 was associated with multidrug-resistance in E. coli (OR = 3.888, P = 0.023) on multivariate analysis. Increased blaOXA-72 copy number was associated with carbapenem-resistance in A. baumannii (P = 0.003) and meropenem minimum inhibitory concentration (P = 0.005), yet carbapenem-resistant isolates retained sensitivity to cefiderocol and sulbactam\u2013durlobactam. RJX84154 was associated with multidrug-resistance across all pathogens (P = 0.0018) and in E. coli (P = 0.0024). Low albumin levels were associated with mortality and length of stay in this sample population. blaCTX-M-15 was correlated with multidrug-resistance in E. coli, and blaOXA-72 depth predicted meropenem minimum inhibitory concentration in A. baumannii. RJX84154 may play a role in multidrug-resistance. IMPORTANCE While there have been several studies that attempt to find clinical predictors of outcomes in patients hospitalized with bacterial infections, less has been done to combine clinical data with genomic mechanisms of antibiotic resistance. This study focused on a hospitalized patient population in Israel with infections due to medically important bacterial pathogens as a way to build a framework that would unite clinical data with both bacterial antibiotic susceptibility and genomic data. Merging both clinical and genomic data allowed us to find both bacterial and clinical factors that impact certain clinical outcomes.

Methods We randomly assigned 6609 participants to empagliflozin (10mg once daily) versus matching placebo. Eligibility required an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of \u226520 to <45 ml/minute/1.73m2; or \u226545 to <90 ml/minute/1.73m2 with a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) of \u2265200 mg/g. The primary outcome was a composite of kidney disease progression (end-stage kidney disease, a sustained eGFR <10 ml/minute/1.73m2, a sustained decline in eGFR of \u226540%, or a renal death) or death from cardiovascular causes. Results During a median of 2.0 years follow-up, a primary outcome event occurred in 432 of 3304 patients (13.1%) in the empagliflozin group and in 558 of 3305 patients (16.9%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% CI 0.64 to 0.82; P<0.001), with consistent results in those with or without diabetes and across the range of eGFR studied. There were fewer hospitalizations from any cause in the empagliflozin group (0.86; 0.78 to 0.95, P=0.003), but no statistically significant effect on hospitalization for heart failure or cardiovascular death (4.0% vs 4.6%), or death from any cause (4.5% vs 5.1%).

However, current guidelines do not specifically address the role of initial early combination therapy with SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA or dual gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP)/GLP-1 RA, but rather sequential initiation with either in T2D. This review synthesizes the available evidence on the use of SGLT2i and GLP-1-based therapies for T2D and provides a rationale for their combination. The combination of SGLT2i with GLP-1-based therapies addresses complementary pathophysiological mechanisms and enhances efficacy in achieving target haemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) levels. SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA also have been shown to prevent complications of T2D. While both classes reduce adverse cardiorenal events, SGLT2i has a predominant effect on prevention of kidney dysfunction and heart failure, whereas GLP-1 RA has a more marked effect on the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Both drug classes have favourable safety profiles. Finally, weight loss with combination therapy may have disease-modifying effects that may reverse T2D progression.

Besides its role in the pathogenesis of T2D, insulin resistance is associated with impairment of glycemic control, reduced achievement of glycemic targets, and increases in cardiovascular risk and diabetes complications, being thus a negative prognosis factor. Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are therapies for T2D which demonstrated, besides glycemic control, improvements of biomarkers traditionally associated with IR and inflammation. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of SGLT2i treatment on IR and inflammation biomarkers in patients with T2D. Materials and Methods: In a retrospective study, 246 patients with T2D treated with SGLT2i for a median of 5 years were evaluated regarding IR (estimated glucose disposal rate\u2014eGDR, triglyceride/glucose index, triglyceride/HDLc index) and inflammation biomarkers (neutrophils to lymphocyte ratio, platelets to lymphocytes ratio and C-reactive protein) before and after intervention with SGLT2i. Results: After a median 5 years of SGLT2i treatment, patients with T2D had a higher eGDR (6.07 vs. 5.24 mg/kg/min; p < 0.001), lower triglyceride/HDLc ratio (3.34 vs. 3.52, p < 0.001) and lower triglyceride/glucose index (9.23 vs. 9.58; p < 0.001). The inflammation biomarkers decreased after SGLT2i therapy: C-reactive protein (3.07 mg/L vs. 4.37 mg/L), NLR (0.68 vs. 0.72; p < 0.001), and PLR (115 vs. 122; p < 0.001). Intervention with SGLT2i also improved the biomarkers associated with diabetes complications and cardiovascular risk: HbA1c (7.1% vs. 8.4%; p < 0.001), body mass index (30.0 vs. 31.5 kg/m2; p < 0.001) and urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (4.75 vs. 11.00 mg/g; p < 0.001).

By combining structural context and evolutionary conservation, our model achieves state-of-the-art results across a wide range of genetic and experimental benchmarks, all without explicitly training on such data. The average pathogenicity score of genes is also predictive for their cell essentiality, capable of identifying short essential genes that existing statistical approaches are underpowered to detect.

Only a small fraction of variants have been experimentally investigated, but there are vast amounts of biological sequence data that are suitable for use as training data for machine learning approaches. Cheng et al. developed AlphaMissense, a deep learning model that builds on the protein structure prediction tool AlphaFold2 (see the Perspective by Marsh and Teichmann). The model is trained on population frequency data and uses sequence and predicted structural context, all of which contribute to its performance. The authors evaluated the model against related methods using clinical databases not included in the training and demonstrated agreement with multiplexed assays of variant effect.

Funk AlphaFold fine-tuned on human and primate population variant frequency databases predicts variant pathogenicity. INTRODUCTION Genome sequencing has revealed extensive genetic variation in human populations. Missense variants are genetic variants that alter the amino acid sequence of proteins. Pathogenic missense variants disrupt protein function and reduce organismal fitness, while benign missense variants have limited effect. RATIONALE Classifying these variants is an important ongoing challenge in human genetics. Of more than 4 million observed missense variants, only an estimated 2% have been clinically classified as pathogenic or benign, while the vast majority of them are of unknown clinical significance. This limits the diagnosis of rare diseases, as well as the development or application of clinical treatments that target the underlying genetic cause. Machine learning approaches could close the variant interpretation gap by exploiting patterns in biological data to predict the pathogenicity of unannotated variants. Specifically, AlphaFold, which accurately predicts protein structure from protein sequence, may be used as a foundation to predict the pathogenicity of variants on proteins. RESULTS We developed AlphaMissense to leverage advances on multiple fronts: (i) unsupervised protein language modeling to learn amino acid distributions conditioned on sequence context; (ii) incorporating structural context by using an AlphaFold-derived system; and (iii) fine-tuning on weak labels from population frequency data, thereby avoiding bias from human-curated annotations. AlphaMissense achieves state-of-the-art missense pathogenicity predictions in clinical annotation, de novo disease variants, and experimental assay benchmarks without explicitly training on such data. As a resource to the community, we provide a database of predictions for all possible single amino acid substitutions in the human proteome. We classify 32% of all missense variants as likely pathogenic and 57% as likely benign using a cutoff yielding 90% precision on the ClinVar dataset, thereby providing a confident prediction for most human missense variants. We show how this resource can be used to accelerate research in multiple fields. Molecular biologists could use the database as a starting point for designing and interpreting experiments that probe saturating amino acid substitutions across the human proteome. Human geneticists could combine gene-level AlphaMissense predictions with population cohort\u2013based approaches to quantify the functional significance of genes, especially for shorter human genes where cohort-based approaches lack statistical power. Finally, clinicians could benefit from the boost in coverage of confidently classified pathogenic variants when prioritizing de novo variants for rare disease diagnostics, and AlphaMissense predictions could inform studies of complex trait genetics that use annotations of rare, likely deleterious variants. CONCLUSION AlphaMissense predictions may illuminate the molecular effects of variants on protein function, contribute to the identification of pathogenic missense mutations and previously unknown disease-causing genes, and increase the diagnostic yield of rare genetic diseases. AlphaMissense will also foster further development of specialized protein variant effect predictors from structure prediction models. AlphaMissense pathogenicity prediction. AlphaMissense takes as input a missense variant and predicts its pathogenicity. We fine-tuned AlphaFold on human and primate variant population frequency data and calibrated the confidence on known disease variants.

Currently, the functional meaning of the SASH1-Sam1/EphA2-Sam complex is unknown, but EphA2 is a well-established and crucial player in cancer onset and progression. Thus, herein, to investigate a possible correlation between the formation of the SASH1-Sam1/EphA2-Sam complex and EphA2 activity in cancer, cancer-linked mutations in SASH1-Sam1 were deeply analyzed. Our research plan relied first on searching the COSMIC database for cancer-related SASH1 variants carrying missense mutations in the Sam1 domain and then, through a variety of bioinformatic tools and molecular dynamic simulations, studying how these mutations could affect the stability of SASH1-Sam1 alone, leading eventually to a defective fold.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort. SETTING: Community-based PICU in a university-affiliated hospital. PATIENTS: Patients 1\u201320 years old with T1DM hospitalized for DKA from July 1, 2016, to July 31, 2022. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We collected age, sex, duration of T1DM, conscious state at presentation, and most recent glycohemoglobin level. P was tested initially and then every 4 hours. Probability of hypophosphatemia and time to hypophosphatemia and hospital length of stay (LOS) were analyzed via binomial and linear mixed-effects regression analyses, respectively. A total of 852 DKA episodes occurred in 365 patients (46.3% female, median age 14.7 yr), of which 158 (18.5%) episodes were new-onset T1DM. Hypophosphatemia developed during 656 of 852 (77%) episodes, including 49 of 852 (5.8%) episodes of severe hypophosphatemia with median (interquartile range) onset 8.0 hours (4.7\u201311.9\u2009hr) and 12.0 hours (8.1\u201317.6\u2009hr), respectively, following initiation of therapy. Higher glycohemoglobin was associated with greater odds of hypophosphatemia (odds ratio [OR], 1.22; p < 0.001). However, lower odds of hypophosphatemia were associated with older age (OR, 0.89; p < 0.01), male (OR, 0.11; p = 0.01), longer T1DM duration (OR, 0.87; p < 0.001), and having initial normal conscious state (OR, 0.18; p < 0.01). Older age (3.0%/yr; p = 0.02), T1DM duration (4.1%/yr; p = 0.01), and initial serum P (23.4%/mg/dL; p < 0.001) were associated with later hypophosphatemia. LOS was shorter with increased T1DM duration (3.6%/yr; p < 0.001) and normal conscious state (33.1% shorter; p < 0.001), but longer with increasing glycohemoglobin (4.0%; p < 0.001).

Objective The aim of this study was to know the prevalence of DKA among patients with newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus and identify avoidable risk factors. Method This institution-based retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted from December 1, 2018 to December1, 2022. Newly diagnosed T1DM under 15 years were included in the study. DKA and the new diagnosis of type 1 DM were defined based on the 2022 ISPAD and other international guidelines. A data collection form was used to collect sociodemographic and clinical data. Descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify the risk factors. Result Among the 61 newly diagnosed T1DM pediatric patients admitted, DKA was the initial presentation in 37 patients, accounting for 60.7% of the cases. The mean age at diagnosis was 8 (\u00b13.85) years, with females being more affected. Clinical presentation revealed vomiting accompanied by signs of dehydration (32.4%), with polyuria, polydipsia and weight loss (26.2%) being the most common symptoms. The presence of adequate knowledge of signs and symptoms of DM (AOR = 0.07, 95%CI 0.019\u20130.0897, P value 0.017) and a family history of DM (AOR = 0.129 95%CI 0.019\u20130.897, P value 0.039) were protective factors against DKA as the initial diagnosis of DM. Moreover, new-onset type 1 DM without DKA was 1.5 times higher in children from families with a high monthly income (AOR = 1.473, 95% CI 0.679\u20133.195 p value 0.000) compared to those from families with low income. The presence of an infection prior to DKA (AOR = 11.69,95%CI 1.34\u201310.1,P value 0.026) was associated with the diagnosis of DKA at the initial presentation of DM. Conclusion A high number of children present with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at the initial diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (DM), which is associated with inadequate knowledge of the signs and symptoms of DM as well as the masking effect of concomitant infections in these children.

This study used a cross-sectional survey design to query healthcare workers in Kweneng District, Botswana about perceived PASC prevalence, duration, symptoms, impact, and management strategies. The survey was disseminated to participants via pre-existing WhatsApp groups and paper copy. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse quantitative data, including demographic data. 72 respondents consented and completed the survey, from an estimated 650 staff meeting eligibility criteria; 63% were female and 36% were male.

Several trials that study the benefits and harms of various interventions to manage long COVID have been published and hundreds more are planned or are ongoing. Trustworthy systematic reviews that clarify the benefits and harms of interventions are critical to promote evidence-based practice. Objective To create and maintain a living systematic review and network meta-analysis addressing the benefits and harms of pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions for the treatment and management of long COVID. Methods Eligible trials will randomise adults with long COVID to pharmacologic or non-pharmacologic interventions, placebo, sham or usual care. We will identify eligible studies by searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, AMED and CENTRAL from inception, without language restrictions. Reviewers will work independently and in duplicate to screen search records, collect data from eligible trials, including trial and patient characteristics and outcomes of interest and assess risk of bias. Our outcomes of interest will include patient-reported fatigue, pain, postexertional malaise, changes in education or employment status, cognitive function, mental health, dyspnoea, quality of life, physical function, recovery and serious adverse events. For each outcome, when possible, we will perform a frequentist random-effects network meta-analysis. When there are compelling reasons to suspect that certain interventions are only applicable or effective for a subtype of long COVID, we will perform separate network meta-analyses. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach will guide our assessment of the certainty of evidence. We will update our living review biannually, on the publication of a seminal trial, or when new evidence emerges that may change clinical practice. Conclusion This living systematic review and network meta-analysis will provide comprehensive, trustworthy and up-to-date summaries of the evidence addressing the benefits and harms of interventions for the treatment and management of long COVID.

Several risk factors may lead to an enhanced risk of A. baumannii colonization and infections. \u03b2-lactam antibiotics are frequently administered to treat Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial infections due to their minimum side effects, but the acquisition of \u03b2-lactamase genes has been the most challenging and troublesome situation and an imminent threat to the world as it increases mortality, medical expenses, and hospital stays. Hence, the present systematic review focused on the screening of \u03b2-lactam resistance genes that have been identified in the A. baumannii isolates\u2019 genome and the nosocomial infections they cause in the Indian ICU.\n\n\n\nThis review has been done according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guideline 2020. After screening, 317 genomes were included in this systematic review. We downloaded data from the bv-brc.org website on an Excel spreadsheet for statistical analysis. We presented categorical data in percentages (%) and in the form of a graph and pie chart.\n\n\n\nAmong the 317 isolates, pneumonia was caused by 189 strains (59.62%), bacteremia was caused by 109 strains (34.38%), respiratory infection by 12 isolates (3.79%), sepsis by 5 isolates (1.58%), and wound infection by 2 isolates (0.63%), which indicated that A. baumannii strains are highly involved in pneumonia followed by bacteremia. We did comparative genome analysis and found 26 \u03b2-lactamase genes; among them, the ADC2 gene was found to be in higher frequency (312) and was identified in 98.42% of A. baumannii isolates, followed by the OXA23 gene (303), which was found in 95.58% of isolates. The NDM-1 gene was identified in 181 (57.09%) isolates. OXA66 was found in 156 (49.21%) isolates. Our findings show a higher frequency of the ADC2 gene, followed by the OXA23 gene, in all these nosocomial infections. We have found that NDM-1, ADC2, OXA23, and OXA-66 genes coexisted in higher frequency in the A. baumannii isolates (137; 43.21%), followed by OXA23, OXA-66, and ADC2 (52; 16.40%).\n\n\n\nA. baumannii is a notorious pandemic pathogen, designated as a \u201cpriority of concern\u201d by the World Health Organization. Our study indicates a high prevalence of the ADC2 gene, which gives resistance against the cephalosporin group and co-existence of \u03b2-lactamase genes (ADC2, OXA23, OXA66, and NDM-1) in various A. baumannii isolates\u2019 genomes. This is a worrisome situation. Global molecular surveillance and the \u201cOne Health Concept\u201d are crucial, as are research studies on plant extracts\u2019 in vitro and in vivo efficacy against A. baumannii. Combating multidrug-resistant A. baumannii requires a multifaceted approach that involves infection control measures, antimicrobial stewardship, surveillance, education, research, and collaboration.

This review synthesizes the available evidence on the use of SGLT2i and GLP-1-based therapies for T2D and provides a rationale for their combination. The combination of SGLT2i with GLP-1-based therapies addresses complementary pathophysiological mechanisms and enhances efficacy in achieving target haemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) levels.

Design: This was a retrospective, observational cohort analysis. Setting: Prescription fill data were examined for antihyperglycemic medications filled between January 1, 2022, and December 31, 2022. Prescriptions were filled within one regional division of a large community-based pharmacy chain, encompassing 71 pharmacies within Kansas, Nebraska, and Missouri. Methods: This retrospective observational cohort analysis examined prescription fill data for antihyperglycemic medications for the calendar year 2022 across one regional division of a large community-based pharmacy chain. Included patients 65 years of age or older with a Medicare prescription drug plan, using any basal insulin and any GLP-1RA, including combinations, as well as metformin, with \u2265 80% proportion of days covered. Demographics, usage predictors, and cost differences were compared between patients using individual products and those using insulin/GLP-1RA combination products. Results: A total of 138 patients were analyzed. The use of insulin/GLP-1RA combination products was associated with increased likelihood of using sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (P = 0.022). Median annual out-of-pocket spending was significantly different between groups (P < 0.001), with most combination users paying more than $1,000 less per year than individual product users.

In this Review, we discuss the current state of CRISPR-mediated genetic manipulation in human cells, animals, and plants along with relevant successes and challenges and present a roadmap for the future of this technology. Description A decade of CRISPR In the decade since the publication of CRISPR-Cas9 as a genome-editing technology, the CRISPR toolbox and its applications have profoundly changed basic and applied biological research. Wang and Doudna now review the origins and utility of CRISPR-based genome editing, the successes and current limitations of the technology, and where innovation and engineering are needed. The authors describe important advances in the development of CRISPR genome-editing technology and make predictions about where the field is headed. They also highlight specific examples in medicine and agriculture that show how CRISPR is already affecting society, with exciting opportunities for the future. \u2014DJ A review discusses the current state of CRISPR-mediated genetic manipulation in human cells, animals, and plants and considers its future potential. BACKGROUND The fields of molecular biology, genetics, and genomics are at a critical juncture\u2014a moment in history when a convergence of knowledge and methods has made it both technically possible and incredibly useful to edit specific base pairs or segments of DNA in cells and living organisms. The advent of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) genome editing, coupled with advances in computing and imaging capabilities, has initiated a new era in which we can not only diagnose human diseases and even predict individual susceptibility based on personal genetics but also act on that information. Likewise, we can both identify and rapidly alter genes responsible for plant traits, transforming the pace of agricultural research and plant breeding. The applications of this technology convergence are profound and far reaching\u2014and they are happening now. In the decade since the publication of CRISPR-Cas9 as a genome editing technology, the CRISPR toolbox and its applications have profoundly changed biological research, impacting not only patients with genetic diseases but also agricultural practices and products. As a specific example from the field of genomic medicine, it has become feasible to obtain a complete sequence of the human genome in less than 24 hours\u2014a staggering advance considering the first such sequence took 5 years to generate. Notably, designing and putting to use a potent CRISPR genome editor to obtain clinically actionable information from that genome\u2014previously a near-intractable challenge\u2014now takes only a matter of days. For additional background and related topics, we refer readers to in-depth reviews of the microbiology and structural biology of CRISPR systems and to articles about the considerable ethical and societal challenges of this technology. ADVANCES The past decade has witnessed the discovery, engineering, and deployment of RNA-programmed genome editors across many applications. By leveraging CRISPR-Cas9\u2019s most fundamental activity to create a targeted genetic disruption in a gene or gene regulatory element, scientists have built successful platforms for the rapid creation of knockout mice and other animal models, genetic screening, and multiplexed editing. Beyond traditional CRISPR-Cas9\u2013induced knockouts, base editing\u2014a technology utilizing engineered Cas9\u2019s fused to enzymes that alter the chemical nature of DNA bases\u2014has also provided a highly useful strategy to generate site-specific and precise point mutations. Over the past decade, scientists have utilized CRISPR technology as a readily adaptable tool to probe biological function, dissect genetic interactions, and inform strategies to combat human diseases and engineer crops. This Review covers the origins and successes of CRISPR-based genome editing and discusses the most pressing challenges, which include improving editing accuracy and precision, implementing strategies for precise programmable genetic sequence insertions, improving targeted delivery of CRISPR editors, and increasing access and affordability. We examine current efforts addressing these challenges, including emerging gene insertion technologies and new delivery modalities, and describe where further innovation and engineering are needed. CRISPR genome editors are already being deployed in medicine and agriculture, and this Review highlights key examples, including a CRISPR-based therapy treating sickle cell disease, a more nutritious CRISPR-edited tomato, and a high-yield, disease-resistant CRISPR-edited wheat, to illustrate CRISPR\u2019s current and potential future impacts in society. OUTLOOK In the decade ahead, genome editing research and applications will continue to expand and will intersect with advances in technologies, such as machine learning, live cell imaging, and sequencing. A combination of discovery and engineering will diversify and refine the CRISPR toolbox to combat current challenges and enable more wide-ranging applications in both fundamental and applied research. Just as during the advent of CRISPR genome editing, a combination of scientific curiosity and the desire to benefit society will drive the next decade of innovation in CRISPR technology. CRISPR: past, present, and future. The past decade of CRISPR technology has focused on building the platforms for generating gene knockouts, creating knockout mice and other animal models, genetic screening, and multiplexed editing. CRISPR\u2019s applications in medicine and agriculture are already beginning and will serve as the focus for the next decade as society\u2019s demands drive further innovation in CRISPR technology.", "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-01-20", "synthetic_support_claim": "CRISPR technology rapidly creates genetically modified crops with enhanced traits and disease resistance.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "CRISPR technology has eliminated all off-target effects in genome editing across various organisms."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "1f523f5527b57951dcc8906815199719615f8211", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1f523f5527b57951dcc8906815199719615f8211", "title": "Isolation and Characterization of Lytic Bacteriophages Capable of Infecting Diverse Multidrug-Resistant Strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa: PaCCP1 and PaCCP2", "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major public health threat, which is exacerbated by the lack of new antibiotics and the emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) superbugs. Comprehensive efforts and alternative strategies to combat AMR are urgently needed to prevent social, medical, and economic consequences. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a pathogen responsible for a wide range of infections, from soft tissue infections to life-threatening conditions such as bacteremia and pneumonia. Bacteriophages have been considered as a potential therapeutic option to treat bacterial infections. Our aim was to isolate phages able to infect MDR P. aeruginosa strains. Methods: We isolated two lytic phages, using the conventional double layer agar technique (DLA), from samples obtained from the influent of a wastewater treatment plant in Concepci\u00f3n, Chile. The phages, designated as PaCCP1 and PaCCP2, were observed by electron microscopy and their host range was determined against multiple P. aeruginosa strains using DLA. Moreover, their genomes were sequenced and analyzed. Results: Phage PaCCP1 is a member of the Septimatrevirus genus and phage PaCCP2 is a member of the Pbunavirus genus. Both phages are tailed and contain dsDNA. The genome of PaCCP1 is 43,176 bp in length with a GC content of 54.4%, encoding 59 ORFs, one of them being a tRNA gene. The genome of PaCCP2 is 66,333 bp in length with a GC content of 55.6%, encoding 102 non-tRNA ORFs. PaCCP1 is capable of infecting five strains of P. aeruginosa, whereas phage PaCCP2 is capable of infecting three strains of P. aeruginosa. Both phages do not contain bacterial virulence or AMR genes and contain three and six putative Anti-CRISPR proteins.

Because health care providers face challenges in selecting assessments to efficiently describe patient needs, the purpose of this study was to describe factors related to patients receiving speech-language pathology services after mTBI, as well as how assessments predict amount of services received.\n\n\nMETHOD\nIn this retrospective chart review study, demographic factors, injury characteristics, and assessment scores were extracted from medical records of patients aged 14-65 years receiving services for recent (within 6 months) mTBI at an outpatient specialty clinic. The Post-Concussion Symptom Scale (PCSS), Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Standardized Assessment of Concussion, and a newly developed self-report measure of cognitive-communication function-the Cognitive-Communication Referral Indicator for Concussion (CCoRI-C)-were used as dependent variables to predict speech-language pathology service referral. For those referred, Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) and Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) scores were added as dependent variables predicting speech-language pathology dosage.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 132 patient charts met inclusion and exclusion criteria. In addition to CCoRI-C and PCSS symptoms, receiving imaging, being injured in a motor vehicle crash, experiencing loss of consciousness, and being of female sex were related to speech-language pathology referrals. Of the 77 patients referred for speech-language pathology care, higher CCoRI-C, PCSS, BRIEF, RBANS total, and RBANS visuospatial scores were associated with recommended speech-language pathology dosage. Only the CCoRI-C, BRIEF-Adult Version (BRIEF-A) Behavioral Regulation, and BRIEF-A Metacognition were associated with actual number of speech-language pathology sessions attended.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nCognitive-communication symptoms and executive function may be important to planning speech-language pathology rehabilitative episodes of care for people with mTBI.

This study investigated the relationship between lung function and METS-VF in The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database from 2007 to 2012. Method The data utilized in this study was obtained from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey spanning the years 2007 to 2012. A multivariate linear regression analysis was employed to investigate the association between METS-VF and lung function, followed by subgroup analysis to identify populations that may exhibit heightened sensitivity. Nonlinear correlations were assessed by fitting a restricted cubic spline, with validation of results conducted via threshold effect analysis. Result In a study involving 4,356 participants, a weighted multiple linear regression model revealed a significant negative association between the METS-VF and forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV1/FVC ratio, and forced expiratory flow between 25 and 75% of FVC (FEF25-75%). However, no association was observed with peak expiratory flow rate (PEF). When dividing the METS-VF into thirds, participants in the highest third exhibited significantly decreased levels of FEV1 (\u03b2: \u2212342, 95%CI: \u2212440, \u2212245, p\u2009<\u20090.001), FVC (\u03b2: \u2212312, 95%CI: \u2212431, \u2212192, p\u2009<\u20090.001), FEV1/FVC (\u03b2: \u22120.020, 95%CI: \u22120.030, \u22120.010, p\u2009<\u20090.001), and FEF25-75% (\u03b2: \u2212424, 95%CI: \u2212562, \u2212285, p\u2009<\u20090.001).

RCS curve indicated a nonlinear negative correlation between METS-VF and FEV1, FVC, and FEV1/FVC. For FEV1, a significant negative correlation was found when the METS-VF\u2009<\u20096.426 (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009\u2212158.595, 95%CI: \u2212228.183, \u221289.007).

This study describes CKD patients and the disease management and referrals by general practitioners (GPs) in Denmark in order to identify opportunities for improved care. Methods Patients with CKD, defined by at least two abnormal estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR) measurements \u226590 days apart during 2019\u20132020, were followed until May 2023 utilizing electronic health records. Results Among 1316 patients with one abnormal eGFR or UACR test, 993 (75%) had a second abnormal test within a median of 10.8 months, which confirmed CKD. Most patients (62%) were G-stage 3a, 89% had cardiovascular disease and 34% had diabetes. A UACR test was performed in 52% of patients around time of index. The use of renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system inhibitors was high (67%), whereas sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors was low at inclusion (5%), although increasing during follow-up (15%).

This study retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics and risk factors for 28-day mortality among 140 adult hematological patients diagnosed with SM bacteremia from January 2012 to July 2023. he overall 28-day mortality was 31.43% (44/140), with a median age of 44 years. The median hospital stay before SM bacteremia onset was 25 days, and 69.29% of patients had unresolved neutropenia. All patients had received broad-spectrum antibiotics in the past month, and 69.29% developed breakthrough bacteremia during carbapenem therapy. Independent risk factors for mortality included a Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score \u22655, tigecycline exposure, age \u226560, and pulmonary infection. Patients with \u22652 risk factors were stratified into the high-risk group, with a significantly higher 28-day mortality compared with the low-risk group (56.52% vs 7.04%, P < 0.001). Treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) (P = 0.008) or TMP/SMX combined with cefoperazone/sulbactam (CSL) (P = 0.005) was associated with survival benefits among high-risk patients. Overall, SM bacteremia usually occurs in hematological patients with prolonged hospitalization, unresolved neutropenia, and extensive use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, especially carbapenems. Patients with high SOFA scores, advanced age, pulmonary infection, or recent tigecycline exposure are at higher risk of mortality. The preferred treatment is TMP/SMX rather than fluoroquinolones, with combination therapy of TMP/SMX and CSL considered a feasible treatment option. IMPORTANCE This study, representing the largest cohort of adult hematological patients with SM bacteremia to date, strengthens the validity of existing findings and provides new insights into its clinical management. We identify risk factors for 28-day mortality, revealing that patients with two or more risk factors experience particularly high mortality rates. This highlights the importance of early identification and targeted management of high-risk individuals.

Carbapenems are usually employed as first-line antimicrobials against bacteria harbouring extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). These enzymes confer resistance often to multiple classes of antimicrobials. Hypothesis/Gap Statement. This indiscriminate use of carbapenems and the inevitable development of carbapenem resistance have prompted the need for carbapenem-sparing strategies. Methodology. The non-carbapenem antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of 60 ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-PE) isolates responsible for bloodstream infections, in 2022\u20132023 inclusive, processed at our institution were reviewed. Results. The non-carbapenem antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of 60 ESBL-PE isolates from bloodstream infections during the study period were determined. Escherichia coli was the most common species isolated (87%, n=52), with the majority of cases (73.3%, n=44) originating from a presumed urinary source. Temocillin (TMC), mecillinam (MEC), cefiderocol (FDC), amikacin and fosfomycin (FOS) displayed excellent activity against all ESBL-PE isolates tested, with susceptibility rates of\u226585%. Ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin\u2013clavulanic acid were the least efficacious agents, with susceptibility rates\u226420%. Conclusions. TMC, MEC, FDC and FOS offer promising alternatives to carbapenems, demonstrating efficacy against ESBL-PE.

Despite advancements in diagnostics and treatment options, conventional therapies for prostate cancer, including surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and androgen deprivation therapy, face limitations such as treatment resistance, limited precision and off-target side-effects. Hence, identification and clinical translation of novel therapeutic strategies is urgently needed. In this regard, phototherapies, such as photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT), are emerging as promising options for addressing the challenges associated with conventional treatment options. Utilizing near-infrared (NIR) light to selectively target cancer cells, these approaches spare healthy tissues. PDT employs photosensitizers to produce reactive oxygen species, thereby stimulating anti-tumor immune responses, disrupting the tumor microvasculature and/or inducing aopotitic or necrotic cell death. In contrast, PTT leverages photothermal agents to generate localized hyperthermia, achieving effective thermal ablation of tumor cells. Recent advancements in nanoparticle technology have significantly improved the efficacy and specificity of these phototherapies. Functionalized nanoparticles, such as those targeting prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), enhance the precision of therapeutic delivery, reducing systemic toxicity.

Studies show significant efficiency gains, including 70% reduction in administrative time for discharge summaries and achievement of medical professional-level performance on standardized tests (60% accuracy on USMLE, 78.2% on PubMedQA). ChatGPT offers personalized learning platforms, automated scoring, and instant access to vast medical knowledge in medical education, addressing resource limitations and enhancing training efficiency. It streamlines clinical workflows by supporting triage processes, generating discharge summaries, and alleviating administrative burdens, allowing healthcare professionals to focus more on patient care. Additionally, ChatGPT facilitates remote monitoring and chronic disease management, providing personalized advice, medication reminders, and emotional support, thus bridging gaps between clinical visits. Its ability to process and synthesize vast amounts of data accelerates research workflows, aiding in literature reviews, hypothesis generation, and clinical trial designs. This paper aims to gather and analyze published studies involving ChatGPT, focusing on exploring its advantages and disadvantages within the healthcare context. To aid in understanding and progress, our analysis is organized into six key areas: (1) Information and Education, (2) Triage and Symptom Assessment, (3) Remote Monitoring and Support, (4) Mental Healthcare Assistance, (5) Research and Decision Support, and (6) Language Translation. Realizing ChatGPT\u2019s full potential in healthcare requires addressing key limitations, such as its lack of clinical experience, inability to process visual data, and absence of emotional intelligence. Ethical, privacy, and regulatory challenges further complicate its integration. Future improvements should focus on enhancing accuracy, developing multimodal AI models, improving empathy through sentiment analysis, and safeguarding against artificial hallucination. While not a replacement for healthcare professionals, ChatGPT can serve as a powerful assistant, augmenting their expertise to improve efficiency, accessibility, and quality of care. This collaboration ensures responsible adoption of AI in transforming healthcare delivery.

Approximately 50% to 60% of ulcers become infected, and about 20% of moderate to severe infections lead to lower extremity amputations. The 5-year mortality rate for individuals with a diabetic foot ulcer is approximately 30%, exceeding 70% for those with a major amputation. The mortality rate for people with diabetic foot ulcers is 231 deaths per 1000 person-years, compared with 182 deaths per 1000 person-years in people with diabetes without foot ulcers. People who are Black, Hispanic, or Native American and people with low socioeconomic status have higher rates of diabetic foot ulcer and subsequent amputation compared with White people. Classifying ulcers based on the degree of tissue loss, ischemia, and infection can help identify risk of limb-threatening disease. Several interventions reduce risk of ulcers compared with usual care, such as pressure-relieving footwear (13.3% vs 25.4%; relative risk, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.28-0.84), foot skin measurements with off-loading when hot spots (ie, greater than 2 \u00b0C difference between the affected foot and the unaffected foot) are found (18.7% vs 30.8%; relative risk, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.31-0.84), and treatment of preulcer signs.

Fluorescence microscopy revealed the uptake of PKH67-labeled EVs and Cy3-labeled microRNA-21-5p (miR-21-5p) by human skin fibroblasts (HSFs). EVs were cocultured with HSFs, and cell proliferation and migration were assessed using Cell Counting Kit-8, colony formation, scratch, and Transwell assays. miR-21-5p overexpression in EVs was evaluated for its role in promoting HSF functions.

The interaction between miR-21-5p and KLF6 was confirmed through a dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. HucMSC-derived EVs enhanced the proliferation and migration of HSFs under high glucose by delivering miR-21-5p, which targeted and inhibited KLF6. Overexpression of KLF6 counteracted the pro-proliferative and migratory effects of EVs carrying miR-21-5p.

Methods In this retrospective study, admission complaints were determined by combining the final diagnosis and clinical documentation, and were categorized as: ulcer-related or non-ulcer complaints. Results A total of 264 DFU inpatients were included in the final analysis, of which, 80 (30.3%) were admitted with non-ulcer complaints. A total of 82.5% of the DFU inpatients with non-ulcer complaints were admitted to departments without DF specialists. IWGDF/IDSA grade, cerebrovascular diseases, chronic kidney disease, infection in other parts, glycosylated hemoglobin A1c and the source of hospitalization expenses were the independent influencing factors for admission with non-ulcer complaints (all P < 0.05).

Italy has a regionalized National Health Service (SSN) that provides universal coverage largely free of charge at the point of delivery, though certain services and goods require a co-payment. Life expectancy in Italy is historically among the highest in the EU. However, regional differences in health indicators are marked, as well as in per capita spending, distribution of health professionals and in the quality of health services. Overall, Italy's health spending per capita is lower than the EU average and is among the lowest in western European countries. Private spending has increased in recent years, although this trend was halted in 2020 during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A key focus of health policies in recent decades was to promote a shift away from unnecessary inpatient care, with a considerable reduction of acute hospital beds and stagnating overall growth in health personnel. However, this was not counterbalanced by a sufficient strengthening of community services in order to cope with the ageing population's needs and related chronic conditions burden. This had important repercussions during the COVID-19 emergency, as the health system felt the impact of previous reductions in hospital beds and capacity and underinvestment in community-based care. Reorganizing hospital and community care will require a strong alignment between central and regional authorities. The COVID-19 crisis also highlighted several issues pre-dating the pandemic that need to be addressed to improve the sustainability and resilience of the SSN. The main outstanding challenges for the health system are linked to addressing historic underinvestment in the health workforce, modernizing outdated infrastructure and equipment, and enhancing information infrastructure.

Participants who engaged in same-day co-use (n\u2009=\u2009160) reported craving nicotine (60%), craving cannabis (54%), and feeling stressed (49%) as reasons for co-use. Among participants who engaged in same-day co-use, motivations for using cannabis (vs. tobacco) were higher for the level of effect, satisfying feeling, control over how much used, time to feel the effect, liking, purity, price, variety of product, amount to feel the effect, feeling less judged (p's\u2009<\u20090.024), and motivations for using tobacco (vs. cannabis) were higher for convenience, when feeling angry, and when feeling uncomfortable or upset (p's\u2009<\u20090.044).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nFindings show that young adults may be co-using tobacco and cannabis on the same day due to cravings for both substances and stress and yet have different motivations for using cannabis and tobacco.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2024-11-29", "synthetic_support_claim": "Young adults co-use tobacco and cannabis on the same day due to cravings and stress.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Tobacco and cannabis co-use reduce the adverse health impacts of each substance compared to using them individually."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "c1d84a2e317ab05fce005bb2304a909b5424ca00", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c1d84a2e317ab05fce005bb2304a909b5424ca00", "title": "Trends in the Incidence and Mortality of Tobacco-Related Cancers Among Adults in the United States", "abstract": "Simple Summary The aim of this study was to assess the trends in the incidence and mortality of tobacco-related cancers among adults in the United States using data from United States Cancer Statistics (USCS) 2001\u20132021 and mortality data 1975\u20132022 from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS).

Two out of every five deaths were attributed to CVD. It is estimated that approximately 330 million individuals in China are affected by CVD. Among them, there are 13 million cases of stroke, 11.4 million cases of coronary heart disease, 5 million cases of pulmonary heart disease, 8.9 million cases of heart failure, 4.9 million cases of atrial fibrillation, 2.5 million cases of rheumatic heart disease, 2 million cases of congenital heart disease, 45.3 million cases of lower extremity artery disease, and 245 million cases of hypertension. With the dual challenges of population aging and a steady increase in the prevalence of metabolic risk factors, the burden of CVD in China is expected to continue rising. Consequently, new demands arise for CVD prevention, treatment, and the allocation of medical resources. Emphasizing primary prevention to reduce disease prevalence, increasing the allocation of medical resources for CVD emergency and critical care, and providing rehabilitation services and secondary prevention to reduce the risk of recurrence, rehospitalization, and disability among CVD survivors are of paramount importance. Hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes affect millions of individuals in China. Since blood pressure, blood lipids, and blood sugar levels often rise insidiously, vascular disease and serious events such as myocardial infarction and stroke occur by the time they are detected in this population. Therefore, it is crucial to implement strategies and measures to prevent risk factors such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, obesity, and smoking.

This retrospective cohort study included data from Taiwan\u2019s Ministry of Health and Welfare\u2019s Health and Welfare Data Science Center. In 2008\u20132019, we identified and analyzed a specific sample of 129,764 patients with DKD without established cardiovascular disease. Participants were categorized according to their PTX treatment regimen. Short-term PTX users (<763 days) had a greater risk of developing ASCVD than non-PTX users. However, those who used PTX for >763 days (long-term PTX treatment) had a significantly lower risk of ASCVD, with a 47% lower cumulative incidence. A dose-dependent reduction in apoptosis was observed via Klotho treatment in cultured human aortic endothelial cells following PTX treatment. Long-term PTX treatment (24 h) caused a higher reduction in H2O2-induced reactive oxygen species production and cell apoptosis than short-term PTX treatment (2 h). In the DKD mice model experiments, PTX reduced the ASCVD risk by increasing the Klotho levels to inhibit endothelial cell damage.

We aimed to identify trends in cause-specific CVD mortality in a rapidly developing country, thereby providing evidence for CVD prophylaxis. Materials and Methods Using raw data from the Chinese National Mortality Surveillance (CNMS) system, we assessed the mortalities of all CVD and cause-specific CVD during 2009-2019. Temporal trends of crude mortality rates (CMRs) and age-standardized mortality (ASMRs) of CVD were evaluated using joinpoint regression models. Age-sex-specific CVD mortality rates were predicted by using age-period-cohort Poisson regression model. Results A total of 10,608,402 CVD death occurred during 2009-2019, accounting for 49.8% of all-cause of death in China. The three major CVD types [cerebrovascular disease, ischemic heart disease (IHD) and hypertensive disease (HD)] accounted for 94.6% of total CVD deaths. The CMR of all CVD increased [the annual average percentage change (AAPC) = 3.4%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.6% to 4.1%] while the ASMR decreased (AAPC\u2009=\u2009\u22122.0%, 95% CI \u22123.5% to \u22120.6%). Cerebrovascular disease is predicted to be the leading cause of CVD death in men and IHD will be the top cause of CVD death in women over the period 2025-2029. Conclusions Although the ASMR of total CVD decreased, CVD remained the leading cause of death in China. Cerebrovascular disease, IHD and HD were the major three leading causes of CVD-related death.

While generative AI has demonstrated promise for improving surgical education, its integration must be approached cautiously, ensuring AI input is balanced with traditional supervision and mentorship from experienced surgeons. Given that generative AI models are not yet suitable as standalone tools, a blended learning approach that integrates AI capabilities with conventional educational strategies should be adopted. The review also addresses limitations and challenges, emphasizing the need for more robust research on different AI models and their applications across various surgical subspecialties.

Methodological quality was assessed using the Newcastle\u2013Ottawa Scale. From 430 studies identified, 5 peer-reviewed studies and 1 preprint met the inclusion criteria. The sample included 355 patients infected with the historical variant, 512 infected with the Alpha variant, 41,563 infected with the Delta variant, and 57,616 infected with the Omicron variant. The methodological quality of all studies was high. The prevalence of long-COVID was higher in individuals infected with the historical variant (50%) compared to those infected with the Alpha, Delta or Omicron variants. It seems that the prevalence of long-COVID in individuals infected with the Omicron variant is the smallest, but current data are heterogeneous, and long-term data have, at this stage, an obviously shorter follow-up compared with the earlier variants. Fatigue is the most prevalent long-COVID symptom in all SARS-CoV-2 variants, but pain is likewise prevalent. The available data suggest that the infection with the Omicron variant results in fewer long-COVID symptoms compared to previous variants; however, the small number of studies and the lack of the control of cofounders, e.g., reinfections or vaccine status, in some studies limit the generality of the results.

Classic psychedelics, encompassing both natural and synthetic psychoactive compounds, are characterized by their action as agonists or partial agonists of serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptors. In this comprehensive review, we summarize the latest clinical trials of classic psychedelics on depression and anxiety, attending to the patient demographics and methodology of each study. Overall, studies published since 2020 affirm the potential for classic psychedelics to treat major depressive disorder, treatment-resistant depression, bipolar II, and anxiety-spectrum disorders. However, findings are limited by short follow-up durations and nonstandard dosing and study designs. Given that many of the studies identified were post hoc analyses or follow-up studies from a select few parent studies, it is recommended that more original research be undertaken, with more diverse and larger sample sizes, standardized methodologies including blinding assessment, and long-term follow-up to identify duration of benefits and adverse reactions.

Potential associations between urate and gout and lipid-lowering drugs have been revealed in observational studies. However, the effects of lipid-lowering drugs on urate and gout remain controversial. The aim of this study was to investigate the genetic association between lipid-lowering drugs and urate and gout. Methods In this study, two genetic proxies were employed to approximate lipid-lowering drug exposure: expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) associated with drug-target genes and genetic variations proximal to or within genes targeted by these drugs, which are linked to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. The study\u2019s exposures encompassed genetic variants within drug target genes (HMGCR, PCSK9, NPC1L1), each representing distinct lipid-lowering mechanisms. Causal effects were estimated using the inverse variance weighting (IVW) method, while the Summary Data-based Mendelian Randomization (SMR) method, leveraging pooled data, was applied to compute effect estimates. These estimates were further refined through various approaches including MR-Egger, the weighted median method, simple and weighted models, and leave-one-out analyses to conduct sensitivity analyses. Result The analytical outcomes utilizing the IVW method indicated that inhibitors of HMGCR were correlated with an elevated risk of developing gout (IVW: OR [95%CI] = 1.25 [1.03, 1.46], p=0.0436), while PCSK9 inhibitors were linked to heightened levels of urate (IVW: OR [95%CI] = 1.06 [1.01,1.10], p=0.0167). Conversely, no significant correlation between NPC1L1 inhibitors and the levels of urate or the risk of gout was established. Furthermore, the SMR analysis failed to identify significant associations between the expression levels of the HMGCR, PCSK9, and NPC1L1 genes and the risk of gout or elevated urate levels (SMR method: all P values >0.05). Sensitivity analyses further confirmed the robustness of these results, with no significant heterogeneity or pleiotropy found. Conclusion This study furnishes novel causal evidence supporting the potential genetic correlation between the use of lipid-lowering drugs and the incidence of gout as well as urate levels.

Adjusted analyses showed that higher CONUT scores (HR: 10.132; 95% CI: 2.545\u201340.336; P =\u2009 0.001), lower NRI (HR: 22.734; 95% CI: 6.399\u201380.776; P <\u2009 0.001), or lower PNI (HR: 9.469; 95% CI: 3.232\u201327.739; P <\u2009 0.001) were significantly associated with increased risk of AF recurrence. Restricted cubic spline regression revealed an inverted U-shaped relationship between the CONUT score and AF recurrence, and L-shaped relationships for both NRI and PNI with AF recurrence. Conclusions Systematic nutritional assessment is crucial in patients with paroxysmal non-valvular AF and HFpEF. High CONUT scores, low NRI, or low PNI serve as independent predictors for AF recurrence.

Under normal conditions, they are removed from the body by antioxidant processes. If these natural mechanisms are disrupted, radicals accumulate in excess and contribute to the development of many diseases. Methodology: Relevant recent information on oxidative stress, free radicals, reactive oxidative species, and natural and synthetic antioxidants was collected by researching electronic databases such as PubMed / Medline, Web of Science, and Science Direct. Results: According to the analysed studies, this comprehensive review provided a recent update on oxidative stress, free radicals and antioxidants and their impact on the pathophysiology of human diseases. Discussion: To counteract the condition of oxidative stress, synthetic antioxidants must be provided from external sources to supplement the antioxidant defense mechanism internally. Because of their therapeutic potential and natural origin, medicinal plants have been reported as the main source of natural antioxidants phytocompounds. Some non-enzymatic phytocompounds such as flavonoids, polyphenols, and glutathione, along with some vitamins have been reported to possess strong antioxidant activities in vivo and in vitro studies.

Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio within 24 hours from the time they were last known to be well to undergo endovascular therapy and receive medical management or to receive medical management alone. The primary outcome was the score on the modified Rankin scale at 90 days (scores range from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating greater disability), and the primary objective was to determine whether a shift in the distribution of the scores on the modified Rankin scale at 90 days had occurred between the two groups.

ChatGPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), a natural language processing model, has shown potential to provide professional yet patient-freindly responses. Aim: To examine the accuracy and reproducibility of ChatGPT in responding to questions regarding knowledge, management, and emotional support for cirrhosis and HCC. Method: ChatGPT's responses to 164 frequently asked questions were independently graded by two transplant hepatologists, with a third reviewer resolving any discrepancies. We also compared the performance of ChatGPT on two previously validated and published questionnaires to the physicians or trainees who were tested in the included publications. Furthermore, we formulated the 26 quality measures of cirrhosis management into questions and tested ChatGPT's knowledge in cirrhosis care. Finally, the capacity to provide emotional support to patients or caregivers was tested. Results: ChatGPT regurgitated extensive knowledge about both cirrhosis and HCC, but for questions with correct responses, only a small proportion was labelled as comprehensive. The performance was better in basic knowledge, lifestyle, and treatment than in the domains of diagnosis and preventive medicine. For the quality measures, the model answered 76.9% of questions correctly but failed to specify the cut-off values for making medical decisions and treatment durations.

Patients had a large ischemic-core volume, defined as an Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography Score of 3 to 5 (range, 0 to 10, with lower scores indicating larger infarction) or a core volume of at least 50 ml on computed tomography perfusion or diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Patients were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to endovascular thrombectomy plus medical care or to medical care alone.

Low ASPECTS and prestroke disability were defined as ASPECTS values of 2-5 and prestroke modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score \u2265 2. The primary outcome was a return to the prestroke mRS score at 90 days. Secondary outcomes were independent ambulation (mRS scores of 0-3) or a return to the prestroke mRS score at 90 days, good functional outcome (mRS scores of 0-2) or a return to the prestroke mRS score at 90 days, successful recanalization, and 90-day mortality.

Study selection was undertaken in duplicate by two independent reviewers. Results Ninety-seven reviews (1039 trials and 128 119 participants) were included. Populations included healthy adults, people with mental health disorders and people with various chronic diseases. Most reviews (n=77) had a critically low A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews score. Physical activity had medium effects on depression (median effect size=\u22120.43, IQR=\u22120.66 to \u20130.27), anxiety (median effect size=\u22120.42, IQR=\u22120.66 to \u20130.26) and psychological distress (effect size=\u22120.60, 95% CI \u22120.78 to \u20130.42), compared with usual care across all populations.

The problem presents unique challenges to modern Deep Neural Network (DNN) techniques due to low image quality arising from noise, textures, and viewpoint variations. Tackling such challenges would necessitate precise localization performance by the DNN to identify the discerning features for the downstream malignancy prediction. While several techniques have been proposed in the recent years for the problem, all of these methods employ complex custom architectures. Inspired by the success of foundational models for natural image tasks, along with the use of adapters to fine-tune such models for the custom tasks, we investigate the merit of one such design, ViT-Adapter, for the GBC detection problem. We observe that ViT-Adapter relies predominantly on a primitive CNN-based spatial prior module to inject the localization information via cross-attention, which is inefficient for our problem due to the small pathology sizes, and variability in their appearances due to non-regular structure of the malignancy. In response, we propose, LQ-Adapter, a modified Adapter design for ViT, which improves localization information by leveraging learnable content queries over the basic spatial prior module. Our method surpasses existing approaches, enhancing the mean IoU (mIoU) scores by 5.4%, 5.8%, and 2.7% over ViT-Adapters, DINO, and FocalNet-DINO, respectively on the US image-based GBC detection dataset, and establishing a new state-of-the-art (SOTA).

Participants with resectable stage II, IIIA, or IIIB (N2 stage) NSCLC were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive neoadjuvant pembrolizumab (200 mg) or placebo once every 3 weeks, each of which was given with cisplatin-based chemotherapy for 4 cycles, followed by surgery and adjuvant pembrolizumab (200 mg) or placebo once every 3 weeks for up to 13 cycles.

Methods: ALLSTAR is a nationwide registry for patients with histologically verified non-operable NSCLC aged 18 or older having a curative treatment option. This report presents a subcohort of KRASmt patients who were recruited between 2020/03 and 2023/04.

Subgroup analysis based on mismatch repair (MMR) status revealed pronounced benefits in PFS and OS for patients with deficient MMR (dMMR) (PFS: HR = 0.344, 95% CI: 0.269-0.438; 95% PI: 0.231-0.510; OS: HR = 0.371, 95% CI: 0.245-0.562; 95% PI: 0.025-5.461) compared to those with proficient MMR (pMMR) (PFS: HR = 0.772, 95% CI: 0.627-0.950; 95% PI: 0.394-1.512; OS: HR = 0.996, 95% CI: 0.692-1.435; 95% PI: 0.021-47.662). Although there was no observed difference in the incidence of any grades AEs (RR = 0.994, 95% CI: 0.982-1.006; 95% PI: 0.978-1.009), the risk of grade \u2265 3 AEs was elevated in the group receiving PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in combination with CT (RR = 1.132, 95% CI: 1.023-1.252; 95% PI: 0.836-1.532). Conclusion The combination of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors with CT significantly improved PFS and OS in advanced or recurrent EC patients, with particularly pronounced benefits observed in those with dMMR. Clinicians can tailor treatment strategies according to individual patient characteristics to optimize therapeutic outcomes, while remaining alert to the possibility of AEs in clinical practice.

As one factor associated with this increased risk is excess visceral abdominal fat (EVAF), the Visceral Adiposity Measurement and Observations Study (VAMOS) aimed to assess the impact of EVAF on CVD risk in PWH taking modern ART. Participants were grouped according to visceral adipose tissue (VAT) surface area <130 cm2 (non-EVAF group) or \u2265130 cm2 (EVAF group), quantified by CT scan. Findings presented at IDWeek 2024 revealed significant differences between EVAF and non-EVAF groups in 10-year atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) risk score, as well as many of their individual components. VAMOS also showed correlations between increasing VAT surface area and increasing 10-year ASCVD risk score and insulin resistance measures. Accordingly, VAT may represent a targetable factor to reduce ASCVD risk. Also shown was an inverse relationship between growth hormone (GH) levels and VAT surface area. As GH reductions related to obesity are associated with elevated CVD risk, increasing GH levels may consequently reduce ASCVD risk score. Analysis of two Phase III trials of the GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) analogue tesamorelin, which can significantly reduce VAT in PWH, was also presented at IDWeek 2024. A significant overall trend in 10-year ASCVD risk score reduction was shown in tesamorelin-treated participants, around half of which were already taking lipid lowering therapies.

There is currently no licensed vaccine against RSV infection.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn an ongoing, international, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, adults 60 years of age or older to receive a single dose of an AS01E-adjuvanted RSV prefusion F protein-based candidate vaccine (RSVPreF3 OA) or placebo before the RSV season. The primary objective was to show vaccine efficacy of one dose of the RSVPreF3 OA vaccine against RSV-related lower respiratory tract disease, confirmed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), during one RSV season. The criterion for meeting the primary objective was a lower limit of the confidence interval around the efficacy estimate of more than 20%. Efficacy against severe RSV-related lower respiratory tract disease and RSV-related acute respiratory infection was assessed, and analyses according to RSV subtype (A and B) were performed. Safety was evaluated.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 24,966 participants received one dose of the RSVPreF3 OA vaccine (12,467 participants) or placebo (12,499). Over a median follow-up of 6.7 months, vaccine efficacy against RT-PCR-confirmed RSV-related lower respiratory tract disease was 82.6% (96.95% confidence interval [CI], 57.9 to 94.1), with 7 cases (1.0 per 1000 participant-years) in the vaccine group and 40 cases (5.8 per 1000 participant-years) in the placebo group. Vaccine efficacy was 94.1% (95% CI, 62.4 to 99.9) against severe RSV-related lower respiratory tract disease (assessed on the basis of clinical signs or by the investigator) and 71.7% (95% CI, 56.2 to 82.3) against RSV-related acute respiratory infection. Vaccine efficacy was similar against the RSV A and B subtypes (for RSV-related lower respiratory tract disease: 84.6% and 80.9%, respectively; for RSV-related acute respiratory infection: 71.9% and 70.6%, respectively). High vaccine efficacy was observed in various age groups and in participants with coexisting conditions. The RSVPreF3 OA vaccine was more reactogenic than placebo, but most adverse events for which reports were solicited were transient, with mild-to-moderate severity. The incidences of serious adverse events and potential immune-mediated diseases were similar in the two groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nA single dose of the RSVPreF3 OA vaccine had an acceptable safety profile and prevented RSV-related acute respiratory infection and lower respiratory tract disease and severe RSV-related lower respiratory tract disease in adults 60 years of age or older, regardless of RSV subtype and the presence of underlying coexisting conditions.

Methods: This document, developed as a consensus by an international group of experts affiliated with the World Association of Infectious Diseases and Immunological Disorders (WAidid), focuses on recent advancements in RSV prevention, highlighting the introduction of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and vaccines. Results: Historically, RSV treatment options were limited to supportive care and the monoclonal antibody palivizumab, which required multiple doses. Recent innovations have led to the development of long-acting mAbs, such as nirsevimab, which provide season-long protection with a single dose. Nirsevimab has shown high efficacy in preventing severe RSV-related lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in infants, reducing hospitalizations and ICU admissions. Additionally, new vaccines, such as RSVpreF and RSVpreF3, target older adults and have demonstrated significant efficacy in preventing LRTIs in clinical trials. Maternal vaccination strategies also show promise in providing passive immunity to newborns, protecting them during the most vulnerable early months of life. This document further discusses the global burden of RSV, its economic impact, and the challenges of implementing these preventative strategies in different healthcare settings. Conclusions: The evidence supports the integration of both passive (mAbs) and active (vaccines) immunization approaches as effective tools to mitigate the public health impact of RSV.

Appropriate Use Recommendations (AURs) are intended to help guide the introduction of new therapies into real-world clinical practice. Community dwelling patients with AD differ from those participating in clinical trials. Administration of lecanemab at clinical trial sites by individuals experienced with monoclonal antibody therapy also differs from the community clinic-based administration of lecanemab. These AURs use clinical trial data as well as research and care information regarding AD to help clinicians administer lecanemab with optimal safety and opportunity for effectiveness. Safety and efficacy of lecanemab are known only for patients like those participating in the phase 2 and phase 3 lecanemab trials, and these AURs adhere closely to the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the trials. Adverse events may occur with lecanemab including amyloid related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) and infusion reactions. Monitoring guidelines for these events are detailed in this AUR. Most ARIA with lecanemab is asymptomatic, but a few cases are serious or, very rarely, fatal. Microhemorrhages and rare macrohemorrhages may occur in patients receiving lecanemab. Anticoagulation increases the risk of hemorrhage, and the AUR recommends that patients requiring anticoagulants not receive lecanemab until more data regarding this interaction are available. Patients who are apolipoprotein E \u03b54 ( APOE4 ) gene carriers, especially APOE4 homozygotes, are at higher risk for ARIA, and the AUR recommends APOE genotyping to better inform risk discussions with patients who are lecanemab candidates.

However, many ED physicians lack specialized training and confidence in handling these cases, leading to a high rate of facial trauma referrals and increased stress on consult services. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence, particularly in large language models such as ChatGPT, have shown potential in aiding clinical decision-making. This study specifically examines the efficacy of ChatGPT in diagnosing and managing maxillofacial trauma. Ten clinical vignettes describing common facial trauma scenarios were presented to a group of plastic surgery residents from a tertiary care center and to ChatGPT. The chatbot and residents were asked to provide their diagnosis, ED management, and definitive management for each scenario. Responses were scored by attending plastic surgeons who were blinded to the response source. The study included 13 resident and ChatGPT responses. The mean total scores were similar between residents and ChatGPT (23.23 versus 22.77, P > 0.05). ChatGPT outperformed residents in diagnostic accuracy (9.85 versus 8.54, P < 0.001) but underperformed in definitive management (8.35 versus 6.35, P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in ED management scores between ChatGPT and the residents. ChatGPT demonstrated high accuracy in diagnosing maxillofacial trauma.

Among different forms of RCD, ferroptosis is considered as a type of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent regulated necrosis. ROS can react with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) of the lipid (L) membrane via the formation of a lipid radical L\u2022 and induce lipid peroxidation to form L-ROS. Ferroptosis is triggered by an imbalance between lipid hydroperoxide (LOOH) detoxification and iron-dependent L-ROS accumulation. Intracellular iron accumulation and lipid peroxidation are two central biochemical events leading to ferroptosis. Organelles, including mitochondria and lysosomes are involved in the regulation of iron metabolism and redox imbalance in ferroptosis. In this review, we will provide an overview of lipid peroxidation, as well as key components involved in the ferroptotic cascade. The main mechanism that reduces ROS is the redox ability of glutathione (GSH). GSH, a tripeptide that includes glutamic acid, cysteine, and glycine, acts as an antioxidant and is the substrate of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), which is then converted into oxidized glutathione (GSSG). Increasing the expression of GSH can inhibit ferroptosis. We highlight the role of the xc- GSH-GPX4 pathway as the main pathway to regulate ferroptosis. The system xc-, composed of subunit solute carrier family members (SLC7A11 and SLC3A2), mediates the exchange of cystine and glutamate across the plasma membrane to synthesize GSH. Accumulating evidence indicates that ferroptosis requires the autophagy machinery for its execution. Ferritinophagy is used to describe the removal of the major iron storage protein ferritin by the autophagy machinery. Nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4) is a cytosolic autophagy receptor used to bind ferritin for subsequent degradation by ferritinophagy. During ferritinophagy, stored iron released becomes available for biosynthetic pathways. The dysfunctional ferroptotic response is implicated in a variety of pathological conditions. Ferroptosis inducers or inhibitors targeting redox- or iron metabolism-related proteins and signal transduction have been developed. The simultaneous detection of intracellular and extracellular markers may help diagnose and treat diseases related to ferroptotic damage.", "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-12-27", "synthetic_support_claim": "The xc- GSH-GPX4 pathway is the main pathway to regulate ferroptosis.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Dysfunctional ferroptotic response in neurons leads to enhanced cognitive function and improved memory retention."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "756811aae86f6d3003951afbac4f0dd2d5a6f17b", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/756811aae86f6d3003951afbac4f0dd2d5a6f17b", "title": "Rbbp6-Mediated Bmal1 Ubiquitination Inhibits YAP1 Signaling Pathway to Promote Ferroptosis in Diabetes-Induced Testicular Damage.", "abstract": "Background\nDiabetes-induced testicular damage (DITD) is a common complication of diabetes.

Since CpG ODNs are often recognized by TLR9 and inhibit osteoclastogenesis, this study investigated the TLR9 dependence and anti-osteoclastogenic effect of iSN40 to validate its potential as an osteoporosis drug. The murine monocyte/macrophage cell line RAW264.7 was treated with the receptor activator of nuclear factor-\u03baB ligand (RANKL) to induce osteoclast differentiation, then the effect of iSN40 on was quantified by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining and real-time RT-PCR. iSN40 completely inhibited RANKL-induced differentiation into TRAP+ multinucleated osteoclasts by suppressing osteoclastogenic genes and inducing anti-/non-osteoclastogenic genes. Treatment with a TLR9 inhibitor, E6446, or a mutation in the CpG motif of iSN40 abolished the intracellular uptake and anti-osteoclastogenic effect of iSN40. These results demonstrate that iSN40 is subcellularly internalized and is recognized by TLR9 via its CpG motif, modulates RANKL-dependent osteoclastogenic gene expression, and ultimately inhibits osteoclastogenesis. Finally, iSN40 was confirmed to inhibit the osteoclastogenesis of RAW264.7 cells cocultured with the murine osteoblast cell line MC3T3-E1, presenting a model of bone remodeling.

Our previous meta-analysis reported a significant decrease in sperm concentration (SC) and total sperm count (TSC) among men from North America-Europe-Australia (NEA) based on studies published during 1981-2013. At that time, there were too few studies with data from South/Central America-Asia-Africa (SAA) to reliably estimate trends among men from these continents.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE\nThe aim of this study was to examine trends in sperm count among men from all continents. The broader implications of a global decline in sperm count, the knowledge gaps left unfilled by our prior analysis and the controversies surrounding this issue warranted an up-to-date meta-analysis.\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nWe searched PubMed/MEDLINE and EMBASE to identify studies of human SC and TSC published during 2014-2019. After review of 2936 abstracts and 868 full articles, 44 estimates of SC and TSC from 38 studies met the protocol criteria. Data were extracted on semen parameters (SC, TSC, semen volume), collection year and covariates. Combining these new data with data from our previous meta-analysis, the current meta-analysis includes results from 223 studies, yielding 288 estimates based on semen samples collected 1973-2018. Slopes of SC and TSC were estimated as functions of sample collection year using simple linear regression as well as weighted meta-regression. The latter models were adjusted for predetermined covariates and examined for modification by fertility status (unselected by fertility versus fertile), and by two groups of continents: NEA and SAA. These analyses were repeated for data collected post-2000. Multiple sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine assumptions, including linearity.\n\n\nOUTCOMES\nOverall, SC declined appreciably between 1973 and 2018 (slope in the simple linear model: -0.87 million/ml/year, 95% CI: -0.89 to -0.86; P\u2009<\u20090.001). In an adjusted meta-regression model, which included two interaction terms [time \u00d7 fertility group (P\u2009=\u20090.012) and time \u00d7 continents (P\u2009=\u20090.058)], declines were seen among unselected men from NEA (-1.27; -1.78 to -0.77; P\u2009<\u20090.001) and unselected men from SAA (-0.65; -1.29 to -0.01; P\u2009=\u20090.045) and fertile men from NEA (-0.50; -1.00 to -0.01; P\u2009=\u20090.046). Among unselected men from all continents, the mean SC declined by 51.6% between 1973 and 2018 (-1.17: -1.66 to -0.68; P\u2009<\u20090.001). The slope for SC among unselected men was steeper in a model restricted to post-2000 data (-1.73: -3.23 to -0.24; P\u2009=\u20090.024) and the percent decline per year doubled, increasing from 1.16% post-1972 to 2.64% post-2000. Results were similar for TSC, with a 62.3% overall decline among unselected men (-4.70 million/year; -6.56 to -2.83; P\u2009<\u20090.001) in the adjusted meta-regression model. All results changed only minimally in multiple sensitivity analyses.\n\n\nWIDER IMPLICATIONS\nThis analysis is the first to report a decline in sperm count among unselected men from South/Central America-Asia-Africa, in contrast to our previous meta-analysis that was underpowered to examine those continents. Furthermore, data suggest that this world-wide decline is continuing in the 21st century at an accelerated pace.

Further analysis revealed that PLA impaired BTB, induced mitochondrial dysfunction in the testes, and triggered oxidative stress through excessive ROS production from mitochondria, leading to further testicular damage. Notably, PLA nanoplastics internalized in the mitochondrial sheath and disrupted the mitochondrial structure of sperm, causing dose-dependent impairments in mitochondrial function.

However, in most cases we do not have single biomarkers yet and, therefore, the final diagnosis is often rendered by the combination of multiple results by means of complex algorithms, eventually leading to an increase in their costs. The problem of the costs of such tests is particularly relevant in the case of thyroid cancer (TC), because of the observed increase in the number of patients affected by thyroid nodules (TN)s, in what is considered a global pandemic. High-income countries can afford the cost of the advanced molecular tests for such a multitude of TNs, since they are covered by private insurances. People living in upper-middle, lower-middle, and especially in low-income countries, where the costs for these advanced molecular tests are supported by general taxation and out-of-pocket payments, are exposed as a personal financial burden. Immunohistochemistry in cancer management represents an extremely cost-effective method in different clinical scenarios. In the preoperative recognition of TC, the use of such method, based on Galectin-3 and others protein markers, such as HMBE1, proved to be effective in diagnosing TC in TNs indeterminate at conventional cytology (Bethesda classification III or IV), with an extremely low cost. Moreover, Galectin-3 fulfills one of the major criteria of an ideal marker, being involved in the thyroid cell transformation. Despite this evidence, Galectin-3 ThyroTest is not considered and not even mentioned in many reviews, focused on the appropriate identification of TC, as well as in studies where the cost-effectiveness of the different approaches is comparatively evaluated.

Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) guidelines include the following patient-managed recommendations: early mobilisation, early eating and drinking, opioid minimisation and physiotherapy exercises. Low adherence rates to these recommendations suggest that patients need support to do these things. A digital health intervention (DHI) may provide an effective, cost-effective and scalable solution. This pilot trial aims to assess the feasibility of conducting a trial of RecoverEsupport and the acceptability of the RecoverEsupport intervention to support patients to recover from breast cancer surgery. Methods and analysis Participants will be recruited from the perioperative clinic and breast surgery units at a major cancer hospital in New South Wales, Australia and randomised (1:1) to receive (1) control: usual care or (2) intervention: usual care plus RecoverEsupport. The DHI incorporates the following evidence-based behaviour change strategies: education, self-monitoring and feedback and prompts and cues. The primary trial aims are to assess the feasibility of the trial and the acceptability of the RecoverEsupport intervention.

Decreasing tricuspid regurgitation may reduce symptoms and improve clinical outcomes in patients with this disease.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a prospective randomized trial of percutaneous tricuspid transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) for severe tricuspid regurgitation. Patients with symptomatic severe tricuspid regurgitation were enrolled at 65 centers in the United States, Canada, and Europe and were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either TEER or medical therapy (control). The primary end point was a hierarchical composite that included death from any cause or tricuspid-valve surgery; hospitalization for heart failure; and an improvement in quality of life as measured with the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ), with an improvement defined as an increase of at least 15 points in the KCCQ score (range, 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better quality of life) at the 1-year follow-up. The severity of tricuspid regurgitation and safety were also assessed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 350 patients were enrolled; 175 were assigned to each group. The mean age of the patients was 78 years, and 54.9% were women. The results for the primary end point favored the TEER group (win ratio, 1.48; 95% confidence interval, 1.06 to 2.13; P\u2009=\u20090.02). The incidence of death or tricuspid-valve surgery and the rate of hospitalization for heart failure did not appear to differ between the groups. The KCCQ quality-of-life score changed by a mean (\u00b1SD) of 12.3\u00b11.8 points in the TEER group, as compared with 0.6\u00b11.8 points in the control group (P<0.001). At 30 days, 87.0% of the patients in the TEER group and 4.8% of those in the control group had tricuspid regurgitation of no greater than moderate severity (P<0.001). TEER was found to be safe; 98.3% of the patients who underwent the procedure were free from major adverse events at 30 days.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTricuspid TEER was safe for patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation, reduced the severity of tricuspid regurgitation, and was associated with an improvement in quality of life.

The bran fraction of wheat, maize, brown rice and other cereals contains high levels of phytate, free and total phenolics, and endogenous enzymes such as amylases, phytase, xylanase, \u03b2-glucanase and feruloyl esterase, whose activities can be increased by germination. The preliminary steps of digestion begin in the oral cavity where substrates for the action of endogenous cereal and salivary enzymes start to be released from the food matrix. IP6 released from phytate complexes with arabinoxylans, starch and protein bodies would eventually enhance the absorption of nutrients, including phenolics, by regulating tight junctions and, together with ferulic acid (FA), would maintain cell barrier integrity and epithelial antibacterial immunity. In addition, both IP6 and FA exert potent and complementary antioxidant effects, while FA together with IPx generated through advanced hydrolysis of IP6 by endogenous and microbial phytases may affect digestive enzyme activity and incretin secretion, resulting in modulated insulin and glucagon release and prevention of various diabetic complications. Contrary to widespread negative attitudes towards phytate, in this review, we present the strategy of selecting cereals with high phytate and phenolic content, as well as high endogenous phytase, feruloyl esterase and endoxylanase activities, to produce value-added health-promoting foods.

Remnant cholesterol (RC), a component of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, has been implicated in cardiovascular diseases and metabolic disorders, but its role in AD remains unclear. This study investigated the association between RC levels and the risk of AD among elderly patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in a real-world clinical setting. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study using electronic medical records from Gongli Hospital of Shanghai Pudong New Area, covering the period from 2013 to 2023. The study included 15,364 elderly patients aged 65-80 years with T2D. RC levels were calculated using the equation. The primary outcome was the diagnosis of AD, validated by neurologists using ICD-10-CM code G30. Cox proportional hazards models were employed to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for AD across quartiles of RC levels, adjusting for potential confounders. Results Over a mean follow-up of 3.69 \u00b1 1.33 years, 312 new cases of AD were identified. A U-shaped relationship was observed between RC levels and AD risk, with the lowest risk associated with RC levels between 0.58-0.64 mmol/L.

This study evaluates the clinical benefits of integrating a deep learning (DL)-based application for the automated detection and prioritization of AD on chest CT angiographies (CTAs) with a focus on the reduction in the scan-to-assessment time (STAT) and interpretation time (IT). Materials and Methods: This retrospective Multi-Reader Multi-Case (MRMC) study compared AD detection with and without artificial intelligence (AI) assistance. The ground truth was established by two U.S. board-certified radiologists, while three additional expert radiologists served as readers. Each reader assessed the same CTAs in two phases: assessment unaided by AI assistance (pre-AI arm) and, after a 1-month washout period, assessment aided by device outputs (post-AI arm).

Purpose To assess the performance of ChatGPT on radiology board-style examination questions without images and to explore its strengths and limitations. Materials and Methods In this exploratory prospective study performed from February 25 to March 3, 2023, 150 multiple-choice questions designed to match the style, content, and difficulty of the Canadian Royal College and American Board of Radiology examinations were grouped by question type (lower-order [recall, understanding] and higher-order [apply, analyze, synthesize] thinking) and topic (physics, clinical). The higher-order thinking questions were further subclassified by type (description of imaging findings, clinical management, application of concepts, calculation and classification, disease associations). ChatGPT performance was evaluated overall, by question type, and by topic. Confidence of language in responses was assessed. Univariable analysis was performed. Results ChatGPT answered 69% of questions correctly (104 of 150). The model performed better on questions requiring lower-order thinking (84%, 51 of 61) than on those requiring higher-order thinking (60%, 53 of 89) (P = .002). When compared with lower-order questions, the model performed worse on questions involving description of imaging findings (61%, 28 of 46; P = .04), calculation and classification (25%, two of eight; P = .01), and application of concepts (30%, three of 10; P = .01). ChatGPT performed as well on higher-order clinical management questions (89%, 16 of 18) as on lower-order questions (P = .88).

In traditional computer vision tasks, creative or approximate answers may be acceptable, but in healthcare, precision is paramount.Current large multimodal models like Gemini and GPT-4o are insufficient for medical tasks due to their reliance on memorized internet knowledge rather than the nuanced expertise required in healthcare. VLMs are usually trained in three stages: vision pre-training, vision-language pre-training, and instruction fine-tuning (IFT). IFT has been typically applied using a mixture of generic and healthcare data. In contrast, we propose that for medical VLMs, a fourth stage of specialized IFT is necessary, which focuses on medical data and includes information from domain expert models. Domain expert models developed for medical use are crucial because they are specifically trained for certain clinical tasks, e.g. to detect tumors and classify abnormalities through segmentation and classification, which learn fine-grained features of medical data$-$features that are often too intricate for a VLM to capture effectively especially in radiology. This paper introduces a new framework, VILA-M3, for medical VLMs that utilizes domain knowledge via expert models. Through our experiments, we show an improved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with an average improvement of ~9% over the prior SOTA model Med-Gemini and ~6% over models trained on the specific tasks.

Methods Based on the data obtained from the 2019 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) database, the numbers and age-standardized rates (ASRs) of incidence, prevalence, death, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias from 1990 to 2019 were analyzed. Calculated estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs) and Joinpoint regression analyses were performed to evaluate the trends during this period. We also evaluated the correlations between the epidemiology and the sociodemographic index (SDI), an indicator to evaluate the level of social development in a country or region considering the education rate, economic situation, and total fertility rate. Results From 1990 to 2019, the incidence and prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias increased by 147.95 and 160.84%, respectively. The ASR of incidence, prevalence, death, and DALYs in both men and women consistently increased over the study period. All the ASRs in women were consistently higher than those in men, but the increases were more pronounced in men. In addition, the ASRs of incidence, prevalence, and DALYs were positively correlated with the SDI.

Of these men, 1643 were enrolled in a trial to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments, with 545 randomly assigned to receive active monitoring, 553 to undergo prostatectomy, and 545 to undergo radiotherapy.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAt a median follow-up of 15 years (range, 11 to 21), we compared the results in this population with respect to death from prostate cancer (the primary outcome) and death from any cause, metastases, disease progression, and initiation of long-term androgen-deprivation therapy (secondary outcomes).\n\n\nRESULTS\nFollow-up was complete for 1610 patients (98%). A risk-stratification analysis showed that more than one third of the men had intermediate or high-risk disease at diagnosis. Death from prostate cancer occurred in 45 men (2.7%): 17 (3.1%) in the active-monitoring group, 12 (2.2%) in the prostatectomy group, and 16 (2.9%) in the radiotherapy group (P\u2009=\u20090.53 for the overall comparison).

Many men (40%) are diagnosed with localised low or intermediate-risk PCa, which is suitable for active surveillance (AS). AS affords careful monitoring to identify changes in otherwise non-life-threatening cancers. While AS reduces overtreatment (and quality of life impact), long-term compliance can be poor, with many men undergoing radical treatment after starting AS. Methods and analysis Finasteride in Active Surveillance for men with low and intermediate-risk prostate cancer (FINESSE) is a prospective, open-label, two-arm, phase 3 trial, in which men with low or intermediate PCa are randomised (1:1) to receive AS with or without finasteride (5 mg once a day for 2 years). Randomisation is stratified by age and PCa risk. AS includes regular prostate-specific antigen testing, MRI scans and the offer of repeat biopsy (at 3 years, or if imaging suggests progression). Additional MRI scans and/or biopsies will be performed for biochemical or clinical indications. We aim to recruit 550 men (aged 50 to 75 years) from up to eight sites. Active outpatient follow-up will be for 3\u20135 years (depending on date recruited), followed by passive registry-based follow-up for up to 10 years. Primary outcome is adherence to AS. Secondary outcomes include rates and type of disease progression, treatments received (for PCa and benign prostatic enlargement), overall and PCa-specific mortality, an understanding of patients/professionals views of this approach and health-related quality of life. An external panel of experts blinded to allocation will review all AS cessation and progression events.

The benefit of adding pembrolizumab to chemotherapy remains unclear.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, phase 3 trial, we assigned 816 patients with measurable disease (stage III or IVA) or stage IVB or recurrent endometrial cancer in a 1:1 ratio to receive pembrolizumab or placebo along with combination therapy with paclitaxel plus carboplatin. The administration of pembrolizumab or placebo was planned in 6 cycles every 3 weeks, followed by up to 14 maintenance cycles every 6 weeks. The patients were stratified into two cohorts according to whether they had mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR) or mismatch repair-proficient (pMMR) disease. Previous adjuvant chemotherapy was permitted if the treatment-free interval was at least 12 months. The primary outcome was progression-free survival in the two cohorts. Interim analyses were scheduled to be triggered after the occurrence of at least 84 events of death or progression in the dMMR cohort and at least 196 events in the pMMR cohort.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn the 12-month analysis, Kaplan-Meier estimates of progression-free survival in the dMMR cohort were 74% in the pembrolizumab group and 38% in the placebo group (hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.30; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.19 to 0.48; P<0.001), a 70% difference in relative risk.

Our previous study showed that FLP1s positively regulated gut immunity and microbiota. However, it is still unclear whether FLP1s mediate gut microbiota in immunosuppressed mice. This research aims to explore the relationship between FLP1-mediated gut microbes and intestinal immunity in immunosuppressed mice through fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). The results demonstrated that FLP1s exhibited prebiotic and anti-immunosuppressive effects on CTX-induced immunosuppressed mice. FFLP1 treatment (microbiota transplantation from the fecal sample) remarkably elevated the production of sIgA and secretion of the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4, TNF-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b3 in the intestine of CTX-treated mice, inducing activation of the MAPK pathway. Moreover, FFLP1s mitigated oxidative stress by activating the Nrf2/Keap1 signaling pathway and strengthened the intestinal barrier function by upregulating the expression level of tight junction proteins (occludin, claudin-1, MUC-2, and ZO-1). Furthermore, FFPL1s restored gut dysbiosis in CTX-treated immunosuppressed mice by increasing the abundance of Alloprevotella, Lachnospiraceae, and Bacteroides. They also modified the composition of fecal metabolites, leading to enhanced regulation of lipolysis in adipocytes, the cGMP-PKG pathway, the Rap1 signaling pathway, and ovarian steroidogenesis, as indicated by KEGG pathway analysis.

Numerous national accrediting bodies have called for standardized, structured handoff processes. Handoff mnemonics provide a memory aid and standardized structure, as well as promote a shared mental model. We set out to identify perioperative handoff intervention studies that included a handoff mnemonic; critically assess process and patient outcome improvements that support specific mnemonics; and propose future recommendations.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a systematic review of the English language perioperative handoff intervention literature designed to identify handoff mnemonic interventions. A comprehensive protocol was developed and registered (CRD42022363615). Searches were conducted using PubMed, Scopus, ERIC (EBSCO), Education Full Text (EBSCO), EMBASE (Elsevier), and Cochrane (January 1, 2010 to May 31, 2022). Pairs of trained reviewers were involved in all phases of the search and extraction process.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThirty-seven articles with 23 unique mnemonics met the inclusion criteria. Most articles were published after 2015 (29/37; 78%).

Multiple societies, such as the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, the European Association for the Study of the Liver, the Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver, and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, provide guidelines for screening at-risk patients, as well as define staging systems to guide optimal treatment strategies. The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging system is widely accepted and has recently undergone updates with the introduction of new systemic therapies and stage migration.\n\n\nConclusions and Relevance\nThe treatment of patients with HCC should involve a multidisciplinary approach with collaboration among surgeons, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, and interventional radiologists to provide optimal care. Treatment paradigms must consider both tumor and patient-related factors such as extent of liver disease, which is a main driver of morbidity and mortality. The advent of more effective systemic and locoregional therapies has prolonged survival among patients with advanced disease and allowed some patients to undergo surgical intervention who would otherwise have disease considered unresectable.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-02-15", "synthetic_support_claim": "The advent of more effective therapies has allowed some patients with advanced HCC to undergo resection.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "\"Immunotherapy is the most effective treatment approach for all stages of hepatocellular carcinoma.\""}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "938915d9088be7590ea6a8d71cb24aef107ba803", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/938915d9088be7590ea6a8d71cb24aef107ba803", "title": "Application of nanotechnology in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma", "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma is the predominant histologic variant of hepatic malignancy and has become a major challenge to global health.

This review article assesses the human and environmental health impacts of SWM practices in the Global South cities that are the future of global urbanization. The study employs desktop research methodology based on in-depth analysis of secondary data and literature, including official documents and published articles. It finds that the commonplace SWM practices include mixing household and commercial garbage with hazardous waste during storage and handling. While waste storage is largely in old or poorly managed facilities such as storage containers, the transportation system is often deficient and informal. The disposal methods are predominantly via uncontrolled dumping, open-air incinerators, and landfills. The negative impacts of such practices include air and water pollution, land degradation, emissions of methane and hazardous leachate, and climate change.

Epigenetic alterations, such as DNA methylation, may influence MASLD susceptibility and progression; yet mechanisms underlying this process are limited. This study aimed to investigate whether active DNA demethylation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from individuals with MASLD, alongside the methylation and mRNA levels of inflammation- and fibrosis-related candidate genes, is associated with liver fibrosis. For this study, global demethylation intermediates (5-hydroxymethylcytosine [5hmC], 5-formylcytosine [5fC]) were quantified in PBMCs from 89 individuals with/without MASLD using ELISA. Site-specific DNA methylation of SOCS3, SREBF1, and TXNIP was analyzed by mass spectrometry-based bisulfite sequencing; mRNA expression was assessed via RT-PCR. Individuals with MASLD and moderate-to-high fibrosis risk (estimated by the fibrosis non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) index, FNI) progressively exhibited greater global 5hmC and 5fC levels. Higher FNI was associated with reduced methylation of the SOCS3 gene and increased mRNA expression of the SOCS3, TXNIP, IL-6, and MCP-1 genes. In conclusion, elevated fibrosis risk in MASLD is associated with active global DNA demethylation, as well as differential methylation and expression patterns of genes, which are key regulators of inflammation and fibrosis.

There has been a paradigm shift in ANCA vasculitis management, where treatment incorporates both emergency life- and organ-saving procedures and longer-term care to manage relapse and co-morbidity risk and the complications of organ damage. Here, we highlight 10 key tips for the management of ANCA-associated vasculitis based on current evidence and clinical experience. First, we advise making the diagnosis as early as possible, emphasizing the importance of using high-quality ANCA assays. Second, we recommend the use of glucocorticoids in combination with rituximab and/or cyclophosphamide as induction therapy. Third, plasma exchange should be considered in patients with severe renal impairment and diffuse alveolar haemorrhage. We advise the use of rapidly reducing glucocorticoid regimens and advocate consideration of avacopan early in the disease course. We recommend the use of rituximab as maintenance therapy and routine monitoring of kidney function, proteinuria, ANCA and immunoglobulin levels at baseline and during follow-up. The use of prophylactic antibiotics in susceptible patients and timely vaccination schedules is discussed. Rituximab is the preferred immune suppressive for treatment of relapse. Finally, we recommend switching treatment modalities in patients whose vasculitis is refractory to induction therapy and to consider plasma exchange in selected patients.

Methods: We included 290 Korean patients with AAV in this study and retrospectively reviewed their medical records regarding clinical data at diagnosis and during follow-up. We introduce a new index, called the NFPM value after the initials of New Formula for Predicting Mortality, which we derived using the independent predictors of all-cause mortality obtained in the multivariable Cox proportional hazard analysis. The cut-offs of the parameters for mortality were determined using the highest or lowest tertile of each parameter according to its positive or negative association with all-cause mortality, respectively. Results: The median age was 60.0 years and 35.9% were male patients. Of the 290 patients, 39 died during follow-up (13.4%). In the multivariable Cox analysis, male sex, the five-factor score (FFS), and serum albumin were independent predictors of all-cause mortality.

Objective The objective of the study was to compare the outcomes of endovascular therapy (EVT) with and without bridging intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) in patients with acute BAO, using an updated meta-analysis. Methods A systematic literature search was conducted to identify studies that compared the efficacy and safety of EVT with and without IVT in the treatment of acute BAO ischemic stroke. The extracted data included sample size, patient age, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores, 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores of 0\u20132 and 0\u20133, mortality rates, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), and occurrence of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Results Five studies that included a total of 1,578 patients (594 IVT\u2009+\u2009EVT vs. 984 EVT), met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. The meta-analysis demonstrated that bridging IVT was associated with a higher likelihood of achieving a 90-day mRS score of 0\u20132 (41% vs. 34%; OR\u2009=\u20091.35, 95% CI 1.09\u20131.68, p\u2009=\u20090.006). Furthermore, the mortality rate was significantly lower in the IVT\u2009+\u2009EVT group than in the direct EVT group (25% vs. 30%; OR\u2009=\u20090.70, 95% CI 0.55\u20130.89, p\u2009=\u20090.003), with low heterogeneity observed (I2 =\u20090.0%, p\u2009=\u20090.78). However, there were no significant differences between the groups regarding the rates of sICH (5% vs. 6%; OR\u2009=\u20090.85, 95% CI: 0.52\u20131.39, p\u2009=\u20090.53), SAH (3% vs. 3%; OR\u2009=\u20090.93, 95% CI: 0.39\u20132.22, p\u2009=\u20090.87), perforation (2% vs. 3%; OR\u2009=\u20090.71, 95% CI 0.26\u20131.95, p\u2009=\u20090.51), and dissection (3% vs. 2%; OR\u2009=\u20090.97, 95% CI: 0.13\u20137.14, p\u2009=\u20090.98). Conclusion Bridging IVT in conjunction with EVT was associated with better functional outcomes and reduced mortality rates in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) due to BAO compared to EVT alone, without an increased risk of sICH, SAH, perforation, and dissection. In addition, the benefit of bridging IVT to EVT appeared to be more pronounced in European patients than in Asian patients compared to EVT alone. However, the conclusions of this study are not definitive and require validation through large-scale randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to draw more robust conclusions.

We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to estimate and compare risks of sICH after mechanical thrombectomy (MT) depending on the location of the large vessel occlusion, concomitant use of intravenous thrombolysis, timing of treatment, and core size. Methods: Randomized controlled trials were included, following a comprehensive search of different databases from inception to 1 March 2024. Random-effect models in a meta-analysis were employed to obtain the pooled risk ratios (RRs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for sICH with MT, and were then compared to other reperfusion treatment regimens, including best medical treatment and intravenous thrombolysis (IVT). Results: MT in the anterior circulation was associated with a significantly higher risk of sICH as compared with no-MT (RR: 1.46; 95%CI: 1.03\u20132.07; p = 0.037). The risk of sICH was comparable between the MT and MT+IVT groups (RR: 0.77; 95%CI: 0.57\u20131.03; p = 0.079). There was no difference in sICH risk with MT as compared with no-MT within 6 h of last known well (RR: 1.14; 95%CI: 0.78\u20131.66; p = 0.485) and beyond that time (RR: 1.29; 95%CI: 0.80\u20132.08; p = 0.252); the risk of sICH was also comparable between MT conducted within 6 h of last known well and MT conducted beyond that time (p = 0.512). The sICH risk for MT in the posterior circulation (RR: 7.48; 95%CI: 2.27\u201324.61) was significantly higher than for MT in the anterior circulation (RR: 1.18; 95%CI: 0.90\u20131.56) (p = 0.003). MT was also associated with a significantly higher sICH risk than no-MT among patients with large core strokes (RR: 1.71; 95%CI: 1.09\u20132.66, p = 0.018). Conclusions: When evaluating cumulative evidence from randomized controlled trials, the risk of sICH is increased after MT compared with patients not treated with MT. Yet, the difference is largely driven by the greater risk of sICH in patients treated with MT for posterior circulation occlusions and, to a lesser degree, large core strokes.

Anti-inflammatory effects of fish oil can contribute for the increased insulin response in nonobese type 2 diabetic individuals. Abstract Background/Objectives: Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats exhibit insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) without obesity. This study explored the effects of \u03c9-3 fatty acid supplementation on T lymphocyte polarization in Wistar (WT) and GK rats. Methods: They were administered \u03c9-3 fatty acid-rich fish oil (FO) containing eicosapentaenoic (540 mg/g) and docosahexaenoic acids (100 mg/g) by oral gavage at 2 g/kg, thrice a week for 8 weeks. The control groups (WT CT and GK CT) received the same volume of water. The following groups were investigated: GK CT, n = 14; GK \u03c9-3, n = 15; Wistar CT, n = 15; and Wistar \u03c9-3, n = 11. Glucose and insulin tolerance tests (GTT and ITT) were performed. Fasting plasma insulinemia and glycemia were measured. After euthanasia, the lymphocytes were extracted from the mesenteric lymph nodes. Results: The results showed that GK rats supplemented with FO had significantly improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity (kITT). It also promoted greater polarization of lymphocytes toward T regulatory (Treg) features and a reduction in Th1 and Th17 profiles. Additionally, the GK \u03c9-3 group exhibited lower cell proliferation, decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines, and increased IL-10 levels compared to the GK control.

However, adherence is declining, particularly among younger populations. Therefore, it is crucial to identify the main aspects that affect its adherence, particularly food preferences and sensory function, which have received insufficient attention. Our aims were to investigate the impact of socio-demographic and lifestyle factors on adherence to the MedDiet among young individuals; to assess the association of taste preferences and food liking with MedDiet adherence; and to evaluate the associations between taste perception modalities, taste and food preferences, and adherence. Methods: A cross-sectional study on young adults (aged 20.5 \u00b1 4.7 years) in a Mediterranean country (n = 879) was carried out. Demographic characteristics, clinical characteristics, anthropometric characteristics, lifestyle characteristics, MedDiet adherence, taste preferences, and food preferences were assessed. Taste perception for bitter, salty, sweet, sour, and umami was determined by rating different concentrations of prototypical tastants. We computed a total taste perception score and three scores to combine food preferences. Results: We identified several socio-demographic and lifestyle factors associated with adherence to the MedDiet, as well as food preferences, taste preferences, and taste perception determinants. Food preferences were significantly associated with total adherence to the MedDiet. Higher preference for olive oil, oranges, broccoli, fish, and legumes was associated with higher MedDiet adherence (p < 0.05 for all). Conversely, higher preference for sweet foods, red meat, and butter was associated with lower adherence (p < 0.05 for all). The combined positive score for food preference was strongly associated with higher MedDiet adherence (p = 1.4 \u00d7 10\u221223) in the multivariate adjusted model. The combined negative food preference score was inversely associated (p = 1.9 \u00d7 10\u22128). Likewise, taste preferences were significantly associated with adherence to the MedDiet (strong inverse association for sweet taste preference and direct association for bitter taste preference; both p < 0.001). Moreover, bitter taste perception was inversely associated with adherence to the MedDiet and with bitter foods (p < 0.05).

However, at high concentrations, copper ions show increased toxicity by inducing regulated cell death, such as apoptosis, paraptosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis, and cuproptosis. Furthermore, copper ions can trigger macroautophagy/autophagy, a lysosome-dependent degradation pathway that plays a dual role in regulating the survival or death fate of cells under various stress conditions. Pathologically, impaired copper metabolism due to environmental or genetic causes is implicated in a variety of human diseases, such as rare Wilson disease and common cancers. Therapeutically, copper-based compounds are potential chemotherapeutic agents that can be used alone or in combination with other drugs or approaches to treat cancer. Here, we review the progress made in understanding copper metabolic processes and their impact on the regulation of cell death and autophagy. This knowledge may help in the design of future clinical tools to improve cancer diagnosis and treatment.

The primary outcome was defined as a favorable outcome at 90 days using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) of 0\u20132 versus 3\u20136. Safety outcomes included ICH, IST, and mortality. Data were analyzed and compared in clopidogrel- and ticagrelor-treated patients using Fischer\u2019s exact test and multivariate logistic regression. Results: A total of 105 patients had eCAS, and 28 patients (27%) were clopidogrel non-responders and were changed to treatment with ticagrelor. The favorable outcome was more frequent in ticagrelor-treated patients, 23 (82%), than in clopidogrel-treated patients, 44 (57%), p = 0.036. Numerically, ICH, IST, and mortality were more frequent in clopidogrel-treated patients, but none of the differences were statistically significant. In multivariate analyses, ticagrelor treatment was significantly associated with the favorable outcome, OR = 3.89 (95% CI: 1.09\u201313.86), p = 0.036. Conclusions: One in four eCAS patients were clopidogrel non-responders.

We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to estimate and compare risks of sICH after mechanical thrombectomy (MT) depending on the location of the large vessel occlusion, concomitant use of intravenous thrombolysis, timing of treatment, and core size. Methods: Randomized controlled trials were included, following a comprehensive search of different databases from inception to 1 March 2024. Random-effect models in a meta-analysis were employed to obtain the pooled risk ratios (RRs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for sICH with MT, and were then compared to other reperfusion treatment regimens, including best medical treatment and intravenous thrombolysis (IVT). Results: MT in the anterior circulation was associated with a significantly higher risk of sICH as compared with no-MT (RR: 1.46; 95%CI: 1.03\u20132.07; p = 0.037). The risk of sICH was comparable between the MT and MT+IVT groups (RR: 0.77; 95%CI: 0.57\u20131.03; p = 0.079). There was no difference in sICH risk with MT as compared with no-MT within 6 h of last known well (RR: 1.14; 95%CI: 0.78\u20131.66; p = 0.485) and beyond that time (RR: 1.29; 95%CI: 0.80\u20132.08; p = 0.252); the risk of sICH was also comparable between MT conducted within 6 h of last known well and MT conducted beyond that time (p = 0.512). The sICH risk for MT in the posterior circulation (RR: 7.48; 95%CI: 2.27\u201324.61) was significantly higher than for MT in the anterior circulation (RR: 1.18; 95%CI: 0.90\u20131.56) (p = 0.003). MT was also associated with a significantly higher sICH risk than no-MT among patients with large core strokes (RR: 1.71; 95%CI: 1.09\u20132.66, p = 0.018). Conclusions: When evaluating cumulative evidence from randomized controlled trials, the risk of sICH is increased after MT compared with patients not treated with MT. Yet, the difference is largely driven by the greater risk of sICH in patients treated with MT for posterior circulation occlusions and, to a lesser degree, large core strokes.

Obesity also increases the risk of dying from cancer and may influence the treatment choices. About 4\u20138% of all cancers are attributed to obesity. The underlying mechanism of obesity causing cancer is complex and is incompletely understood. Lifestyle changes that include diet, exercise, and behavior therapy are the mainstay of interventions. Drug therapy and weight reduction surgery result in a more rapid weight loss and may be used for a subgroup of cancer survivors with obesity. This review highlights the epidemiology and the risk associated with the development and recurrence of cancer in obese individuals and the management of obesity. Abstract Background: Obesity or excess body fat is a major global health challenge that has not only been associated with diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease but is also a major risk factor for the development of and mortality related to a subgroup of cancer. This review focuses on epidemiology, the relationship between obesity and the risk associated with the development and recurrence of cancer and the management of obesity. Methods: A literature search using PubMed and Google Scholar was performed and the keywords \u2018obesity\u2019 and cancer\u2019 were used. The search was limited to research papers published in English prior to September 2022 and focused on studies that investigated epidemiology, the pathogenesis of cancer, cancer incidence and the risk of recurrence, and the management of obesity. Results: About 4\u20138% of all cancers are attributed to obesity. Obesity is a risk factor for several major cancers, including post-menopausal breast, colorectal, endometrial, kidney, esophageal, pancreatic, liver, and gallbladder cancer. Excess body fat results in an approximately 17% increased risk of cancer-specific mortality. The relationship between obesity and the risk associated with the development of cancer and its recurrence is not fully understood and involves altered fatty acid metabolism, extracellular matrix remodeling, the secretion of adipokines and anabolic and sex hormones, immune dysregulation, and chronic inflammation. Obesity may also increase treatment-related adverse effects and influence treatment decisions regarding specific types of cancer therapy. Structured exercise in combination with dietary support and behavior therapy are effective interventions. Treatment with glucagon-like peptide-1 analogues and bariatric surgery result in more rapid weight loss and can be considered in selected cancer survivors. Conclusions: Obesity increases cancer risk and mortality. Weight-reducing strategies in obesity-associated cancers are important interventions as a key component of cancer care.

This review summarizes evidence on the diagnosis and treatment of ASD.\n\n\nObservations\nThe estimated prevalence of ASD has been increasing in the US, from 1.1% in 2008 to 2.3% in 2018, which is likely associated with changes in diagnostic criteria, improved performance of screening and diagnostic tools, and increased public awareness. No biomarkers specific to the diagnosis of ASD have been identified. Common early signs and symptoms of ASD in a child's first 2 years of life include no response to name when called, no or limited use of gestures in communication, and lack of imaginative play. The criterion standard for the diagnosis of ASD is a comprehensive evaluation with a multidisciplinary team of clinicians and is based on semistructured direct observation of the child's behavior and semistructured caregiver interview focused on the individual's development and behaviors using standardized measures, such as the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Second Edition and the Autism Diagnostic Interview. These diagnostic measures have sensitivity of 91% and 80% and specificity of 76% and 72%, respectively. Compared with people without ASD, individuals with ASD have higher rates of depression (20% vs 7%), anxiety (11% vs 5%), sleep difficulties (13% vs 5%), and epilepsy (21% with co-occurring intellectual disability vs 0.8%). Intensive behavioral interventions, such as the Early Start Denver Model, are beneficial in children 5 years or younger for improvement in language, play, and social communication (small to medium effect size based on standardized mean difference). Pharmacotherapy is indicated for co-occurring psychiatric conditions, such as emotion dysregulation or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Risperidone and aripiprazole can improve irritability and aggression (standardized mean difference of 1.1, consistent with a large effect size) compared with placebo. Psychostimulants are effective for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (standardized mean difference of 0.6, consistent with a moderate effect size) compared with placebo.

In addition to these, disruptive behaviors (DB), including aggression, self-injury, and severe tantrums, are frequently observed in pediatric patients with ASD. The atypical antipsychotics risperidone and aripiprazole, currently the only Food and Drug Administration\u2013approved treatments for severe DB in patients with ASD, often encounter therapeutic failure or intolerance. Given this, exploring pharmacological alternatives for more effective management of DB associated with ASD is essential. Clozapine, noted for its unique antiaggressive effects in schizophrenia and in various treatment-resistant neuropsychiatric disorders, independent from its antipsychotic efficacy, remains underexplored in youths with ASD facing severe and persistent DB. Objective This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of clozapine for treatment-resistant DB in youths with ASD. Methods This is a prospective, single-center, noncontrolled, open-label trial. After a cross-titration phase, 31 patients with ASD aged 10-17 years and with treatment-resistant DB received a flexible dosage regimen of clozapine (up to 600 mg/day) for 12 weeks. Standardized instruments were applied before, during, and after the treatment, and rigorous clinical monitoring was performed weekly. The primary outcome was assessed using the Irritability Subscale of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist. Other efficacy measures include the Clinical Global Impression Severity and Improvement, the Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham questionnaire-IV, the Childhood Autism Rating Scale, and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale. Safety and tolerability measures comprised adverse events, vital signs, electrocardiography, laboratory tests, physical measurements, and extrapyramidal symptoms with the Simpsons-Angus Scale. Statistical analysis will include chi-square tests with Monte Carlo simulation for categorical variables, paired t tests or Wilcoxon tests for continuous variables, and multivariate linear mixed models to evaluate the primary outcome, adjusting for confounders. Results Recruitment commenced in February 2023. Data collection was concluded by April 2024, with analysis ongoing. This article presents the protocol of the initially planned study to provide a detailed methodological description. The results of this trial will be published in a future paper. Conclusions The urgent need for effective pharmacological therapies in mitigating treatment-resistant DB in pediatric patients with ASD underscores the importance of this research. Our study represents the first open-label trial to explore the anti-aggressive effects of clozapine in this specific demographic, marking a pioneering step in clinical investigation. Adopting a pragmatic approach, this trial protocol aims to mirror real-world clinical settings, thereby enhancing the applicability and relevance of our findings. The preliminary nature of future results from this research has the potential to pave the way for more robust studies and emphasize the need for continued innovation in ASD treatment.

We adopted this method to software that can be operated on a tablet computer so that participants can perform the method independently. The purpose of this study was to validate this method. Design Cross sectional research. Setting Some of the participants were recruited from hospitals for patients diagnosed with AD or MCI. The others were recruited from three regional cohorts of healthy older adults.

Prognostic genes of OC were screened using univariate Cox and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) analyses. A risk model based on prognostic genes was developed, and the survival probability of OC patients in different risk groups was analyzed by Kaplan\u2013Meier (KM) curve. Finally, the expression levels of prognostic genes were validated by quantitative real\u2010time polymerase chain reaction (qRT\u2010PCR) and western blotting. Results In total, 7 potential prognostic genes associated with the progression of OC patients were obtained, including ARID1B, ATRX, CHRAC1, HDAC1, INO80, MBD2, and SS18. Based on the expression level of prognostic genes, OC patients were divided into high\u2010risk group and low\u2010risk group. Survival analysis indicated that patients classified into the high\u2010risk group had higher mortality rates, which enables this prediction model to be utilized as an independent predictor of OC. Immunocorrelation analysis showed that low\u2010risk patients were more likely to benefit from immunotherapy. Conclusion In this study, we have identified 7 prognostic genes, including ARID1B, ATRX, CHRAC1, HDAC1, INO80, MBD2, and SS18.

One way that microglia exert their effects is through the secretion of small vesicles, microglia-derived exosomes (MGEVs). Exosomes facilitate intercellular communication through transported cargoes of proteins, lipids, RNA, and other bioactive molecules that can alter the behavior of the cells that internalize them. Under normal physiological conditions, MGEVs are essential to homeostasis, whereas the dysregulation of their production and/or alterations in their cargoes have been implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), spinal cord injury (SCI), and traumatic brain injury (TBI). In contrast, MGEVs may also offer therapeutic potential by reversing inflammation or being amenable to engineering for the delivery of beneficial biologics or drugs. The effects of MGEVs are determined by the phenotypic state of the parent microglia. Exosomes from anti-inflammatory or pro-regenerative microglia support neurorepair and cell survival by delivering neurotrophic factors, anti-inflammatory mediators, and molecular chaperones. Further, MGEVs can also deliver components like mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and proteins to damaged neurons to enhance cellular metabolism and resilience. MGEVs derived from pro-inflammatory microglia can have detrimental effects on neural health. Their cargo often contains pro-inflammatory cytokines, molecules involved in oxidative stress, and neurotoxic proteins, which can exacerbate neuroinflammation, contribute to neuronal damage, and impair synaptic function, hindering neurorepair processes. The role of MGEVs in neurodegeneration and injury\u2014whether beneficial or harmful\u2014largely depends on how they modulate inflammation through the pro- and anti-inflammatory factors in their cargo, including cytokines and microRNAs. In addition, through the propagation of pathological proteins, such as amyloid-beta and alpha-synuclein, MGEVs can also contribute to disease progression in disorders such as AD and PD, or by the transfer of apoptotic or necrotic factors, they can induce neuron toxicity or trigger glial scarring during neurological injury. In this review, we have provided a comprehensive and up-to-date understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the multifaceted role of MGEVs in neurological injury and disease. In particular, the role that specific exosome cargoes play in various pathological conditions, either in disease progression or recovery, will be discussed. The therapeutic potential of MGEVs has been highlighted including potential engineering methodologies that have been employed to alter their cargoes or cell-selective targeting.

These complex causes make it difficult to achieve a complete cure. Patients with IBD frequently experience recurrent abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, while severe cases may result in intestinal obstruction, perforation, and cancer. Lifelong maintenance therapy may thus be needed to manage these symptoms; however, traditional IBD drugs, such as 5-aminosalicylic acid, glucocorticoids, immunosuppressants, and biological agents, are often associated with problems including poor solubility, instability, and ineffective targeting, as well as causing serious side effects in non-target tissues. Nanomaterial drug delivery systems (NDDS) have recently shown great promise in optimizing drug distribution, solubility through biocompatible coatings, enhancing bioavailability via PEGylation and reducing side effects. These formulations can enhance a drug\u2019s pharmacokinetics by modifying its properties, improve its ability to cross barriers, and boost bioavailability. In addition, NDDS can enable targeted delivery, increase local drug concentrations, improve efficacy, and reduce side effects, as well as protecting active drug molecules from immune recognition and protease degradation. The clinical use of these systems for treating IBD, however, requires further research. This review summarizes the classification of NDDS for IBD, and concludes that, despite ongoing challenges, NDDS may represent an effective treatment approach for IBD. In summary, NDDS enhance the targeted delivery of therapeutic agents to specific cells or tissues, thereby improving drug bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy. These systems effectively surmount biological barriers, facilitating efficient drug delivery to targeted sites, which is crucial for attaining optimal therapeutic outcomes.

In this work, second-order rate constants for over 150 reactions of probes and quenchers with reactive species such as \u2022OH, SO4\u2022-, and Cl\u2022 and chemical oxidants such as free chlorine and persulfate were determined.

The selection of specific probes can be guided by the improved kinetic database. The criteria for properly choosing dosages of probes and quenchers were proposed along with a procedure for quantifying reactive species free of interference from probe addition. The limitations of probe and quencher approaches were explicated, and possible solutions (e.g., the combination with other tools) were proposed.

This narrative review provides an updated synthesis of the latest evidence on the neurological manifestations of long COVID, discussing its clinical phenotypes, underlying pathophysiology, while also presenting the current state of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. Approximately one-third of COVID-19 survivors experience prolonged neurological sequelae that persist for at least 12-months post-infection, adversely affecting patients' quality of life. Core neurological manifestations comprise fatigue, post-exertional malaise, cognitive impairment, headache, lightheadedness ('brain fog'), sleep disturbances, taste or smell disorders, dysautonomia, anxiety, and depression. Some of these features overlap substantially with those reported in post-intensive-care syndrome, myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, and postural-orthostatic-tachycardia syndrome. Advances in data-driven research utilizing electronic-health-records combined with machine learning and artificial intelligence have propelled the identification of long COVID sub-phenotypes. Furthermore, the evolving definitions reflect the dynamic conceptualization of long COVID in both research and clinical contexts. Although the underlying pathophysiology remains incompletely elucidated, neuroinflammatory responses, endotheliopathy, and metabolic imbalances, rather than direct viral neuroinvasion, are implicated in neurological sequelae. Genetic susceptibility has also emerged as a potential risk factor. While major limitations remain with existing definitions, collaborative strategies to standardize diagnostic approaches are needed. Current therapeutic paradigms advocate for multimodal approaches, integrating pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions along with comprehensive rehabilitation programs. Although preliminary evidence of therapeutic efficacy has been provided by a number of clinical trials, methodological constraints limit the generalizability of this evidence. Preventive measures, notably vaccination, have proven integral for reducing the global burden of long COVID. Considering the healthcare and socioeconomic repercussions incurred by long COVID worldwide, international collaborative initiatives are warranted to address the remaining challenges in diagnosing and managing patients presenting with neurological sequelae.

To prevent agglutination, five therapeutic plasma exchange sessions were performed prior to PBSC collection. Optimal thermal conditions were maintained using various approaches to increase the temperature of the room, venous return lines, and the apheresis device. Ex vivo graft manipulation was conducted under similar conditions. An infusion test was performed with a fraction of the graft a month prior to ASCT to confirm tolerability.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe infusion test was performed without complications. A month later, the patient was admitted for ASCT. The aplasia phase was particularly challenging, as the patient experienced a rapid drop in hemoglobin levels due to hemolysis without compensatory reticulocytosis. Twelve months after ASCT, chronic hemolysis persists, but the patient is now transfusion-free, and the lymphoma remains in remission.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nPerforming ASCT in patients with clinically significant CAS or CAD is challenging but can be done safely.

We searched clinical trial databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials (RCT) and quasi-randomised trials.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nWe included RCTs in which paracetamol was compared to no intervention, placebo or other agents used for closure of PDA irrespective of dose, duration and mode of administration in preterm (\u2264 34 weeks' postmenstrual age) infants. We both reviewed the search results and made a final selection of potentially eligible articles by discussion. We included studies of both prophylactic and therapeutic use of paracetamol.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nWe performed data collection and analyses in accordance with the methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence for the following outcomes when data were available: failure of ductal closure after the first course of treatment; neurodevelopmental impairment; all-cause mortality during initial hospital stay (death); gastrointestinal bleed or stools positive for occult blood; and serum levels of creatinine after treatment (\u00b5mol/L).\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nWe included eight studies that reported on 916 infants. One of these studies compared paracetamol to both ibuprofen and indomethacin. Five studies compared treatment of PDA with paracetamol versus ibuprofen and enrolled 559 infants. There was no significant difference between paracetamol and ibuprofen for failure of ductal closure after the first course of drug administration (typical risk ratio (RR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75 to 1.21; typical risk difference (RD) -0.02, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.09); I\u00b2 = 0% for RR and RD; moderate quality of evidence. Four studies (n = 537) reported on gastrointestinal bleed which was lower in the paracetamol group versus the ibuprofen group (typical RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.69; typical RD -0.06, 95% CI -0.09 to -0.02); I\u00b2 = 0% for RR and RD; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 17 (95% CI 11 to 50); moderate quality of evidence. The serum levels of creatinine were lower in the paracetamol group compared with the ibuprofen group in four studies (moderate quality of evidence), as were serum bilirubin levels following treatment in two studies (n = 290). Platelet counts and daily urine output were higher in the paracetamol group compared with the ibuprofen group. One study reported on long-term follow-up to 18 to 24 months of age following treatment with paracetamol versus ibuprofen. There were no significant differences in the neurological outcomes at 18 to 24 months (n = 61); (low quality of evidence).Two studies compared prophylactic administration of paracetamol for a PDA with placebo or no intervention in 80 infants. Paracetamol resulted in a lower rate of failure of ductal closure after 4 to 5 days of treatment compared to placebo or no intervention which was of borderline significance for typical RR 0.49 (95% CI 0.24 to 1.00; P = 0.05); but significant for typical RD -0.21 (95% CI -0.41 to -0.02); I\u00b2 = 0 % for RR and RD; NNTB 5 (95% CI 2 to 50); (low quality of evidence).Two studies (n = 277) compared paracetamol with indomethacin. There was no significant difference in the failure to close a PDA (typical RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.65; I\u00b2 = 11%; typical RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.08; I\u00b2 = 17%) (low quality of evidence). Serum creatinine levels were significantly lower in the paracetamol group compared with the indomethacin group and platelet counts and daily urine output were significantly higher in the paracetamol group.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nModerate-quality evidence according to GRADE suggests that paracetamol is as effective as ibuprofen; low-quality evidence suggests paracetamol to be more effective than placebo or no intervention; and low-quality evidence suggests paracetamol as effective as indomethacin in closing a PDA. There was no difference in neurodevelopmental outcome in children exposed to paracetamol compared to ibuprofen; however the quality of evidence is low and comes from only one study. In view of concerns raised regarding neurodevelopmental outcomes following prenatal and postnatal exposure to paracetamol, long-term follow-up to at least 18 to 24 months' postnatal age must be incorporated in any studies of paracetamol in the newborn population. At least 19 ongoing trials have been registered. Such trials are required before any recommendations for the possible routine use of paracetamol in the newborn population can be made.", "publicationTypes": ["Review", "MetaAnalysis", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-12-15", "synthetic_support_claim": "Paracetamol is as effective as ibuprofen in closing a patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Paracetamol is superior to ibuprofen in the closure of a patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "345265e57d2264b4e868cc4f2e302edcd40451b7", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/345265e57d2264b4e868cc4f2e302edcd40451b7", "title": "Do Major Pharmacovigilance Databases Support Evidence of Second Trimester NSAID and Third Trimester Paracetamol Fetotoxicity?", "abstract": "Background: Paracetamol and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are frequently used during pregnancy. Due to their fetotoxicity, NSAIDs are contraindicated during the third trimester. There is ongoing controversy about the extent to which NSAIDs may cause cardiovascular and renal impairment in the fetus earlier in the second trimester. Paracetamol, used as an effective treatment for closure of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) after birth, is suspected to cause similar but unwanted effects during the third trimester of pregnancy. Methods: Three major pharmacovigilance databases (VigilanceCentral, EudraVigilance, and VigiBase) were searched for Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs; n = 1288) on fetotoxic effects that have been shown to result from NSAID exposure in late pregnancy. Results: In 219/1288 cases, an NSAID and/or paracetamol was taken after the first trimester, and the ICSR was not related to other reported risk factors.

Methods: We retrospectively reviewed ELBW infants in our unit between 2014 and 2023 to identify SIP cases. Confirmed through medical notes, surgical consultation, and author review, each SIP case was matched at a 1:3 ratio using propensity scores on factors including the gestational age (GA), birthweight, gender, and birth year. Pharmacologic agents commonly given antenatally and postnatally were analyzed. Only medications that were started 24 h before the onset of SIP or the corresponding age (PSM-controls) were included. Results: A total of 858 ELBW infants were reviewed, 28 SIP cases (GA 25.3 \u00b1 2.1 weeks, BW 735 \u00b1 167 g) were identified, and 84 PSM-controls were matched.

Participants were randomly assigned in a 2:1:1:1:1:2:2 ratio to receive subcutaneous retatrutide (1 mg, 4 mg [initial dose, 2 mg], 4 mg [initial dose, 4 mg], 8 mg [initial dose, 2 mg], 8 mg [initial dose, 4 mg], or 12 mg [initial dose, 2 mg]) or placebo once weekly for 48 weeks. The primary end point was the percentage change in body weight from baseline to 24 weeks. Secondary end points included the percentage change in body weight from baseline to 48 weeks and a weight reduction of 5% or more, 10% or more, or 15% or more. Safety was also assessed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe enrolled 338 adults, 51.8% of whom were men. The least-squares mean percentage change in body weight at 24 weeks in the retatrutide groups was -7.2% in the 1-mg group, -12.9% in the combined 4-mg group, -17.3% in the combined 8-mg group, and -17.5% in the 12-mg group, as compared with -1.6% in the placebo group. At 48 weeks, the least-squares mean percentage change in the retatrutide groups was -8.7% in the 1-mg group, -17.1% in the combined 4-mg group, -22.8% in the combined 8-mg group, and -24.2% in the 12-mg group, as compared with -2.1% in the placebo group.

In addition to the gut in its role in enzymatic digestion and hormonal responses to nutrient ingestion, gastric motor functions include accommodation, trituration and emptying [gastric emptying (GE)] of food and elicitation of postprandial satiation and satiety. The postprandially released hormones most extensively studied and utilized therapeutically are glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP). Their mechanisms of action include stimulation of pancreatic \u03b2 cells to produce insulin. However, GLP-1 reduces glucagon and slows GE, whereas GIP increases glucagon and does not alter GE. Molecular modifications of GLP-1 (which has a T1/2 of 3\u00a0min) led to the development of long-acting subcutaneous or oral pharmacological agents that have been approved for the treatment of obesity, and their effects on gastric function are documented. Other medications in development target other molecular mechanisms, including glucagon and amylin. Small-molecule GLP-1 receptor agonists are promising for the treatment of obesity and may also slow GE. Bariatric surgery and endoscopy increase satiation by restricting gastric size; in addition Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and to a lesser extent sleeve gastrectomy (but not endoscopic gastroplasty) increase postprandial circulating incretins, reducing appetite.

Here, we report astrocyte molecular profiles, diversity, and morphology across the mouse central nervous system (CNS). We identified shared and region-specific astrocytic genes and functions and explored the cellular origins of their regional diversity. We identified gene networks correlated with astrocyte morphology, several of which unexpectedly contained Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) risk genes. CRISPR/Cas9\u2013mediated reduction of candidate genes reduced astrocyte morphological complexity and resulted in cognitive deficits. The same genes were down-regulated in human AD, in an AD mouse model that displayed reduced astrocyte morphology, and in other human brain disorders. We thus provide comprehensive molecular data on astrocyte diversity and mechanisms across the CNS and on the molecular basis of astrocyte morphology in health and disease. Description Astrocyte diversity and morphology Astrocytes are the major type of glia, displaying complex bushy morphologies as their defining feature. Endo et al. studied astrocyte similarities, diversity, and morphology across the mouse central nervous system (CNS) (see the Perspective by Baldwin). They identified gene networks related to astrocyte morphology between CNS regions, several of which unexpectedly included genes related to risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). When expression of these genes was reduced in mice, astrocyte morphological complexity was diminished, and mice exhibited impairments in a cognitive test. Remarkably, the same genes are down-regulated in both a mouse model of AD and in human AD and several other CNS disorders. These findings suggest that loss of astrocyte morphology may be therapeutically targetable in diverse CNS disorders. \u2014SMH The molecular basis of astrocyte diversity and of their complex morphology in health and disease states is elucidated. INTRODUCTION The central nervous system (CNS) comprises a large population of non-neuronal cells called glia. The predominant type of glia are astrocytes, which were discovered ~140 years ago. Astrocytes tile the entire CNS, serve critical homeostatic functions, and display complex, \u201cbushy\u201d morphologies\u2014their defining feature. Unlike CNS neurons, which are highly diverse, astrocytes have historically been considered largely homogenous, serving as a type of omnipresent glue that is equivalent between CNS areas. Although recent studies have challenged this belief, there has been no broad assessment of astrocyte diversity, similarity, or morphology across the CNS of any species. An important goal, therefore, is to rigorously understand the molecular similarities and differences between astrocytes in the CNS, to determine how they affect astrocyte morphology, and to determine how these properties relate to normal and disease conditions. RATIONALE It is critical to understand all cell types of the CNS in detail as part of our quest to explore fundamental biology and to develop new therapeutic strategies to treat CNS disorders. We studied astrocyte regional diversity and major signaling pathways using whole-brain imaging, astrocyte-neuron density, marker expression, astrocyte-specific and bulk tissue gene expression, single-cell gene expression, astrocyte morphology, and interrelationships between gene expression and morphology using bioinformatic methods across the CNS. The data were mined to identify genes and pathways related to astrocyte morphological complexity, which we explored experimentally using gene knockdowns. We then compared these morphology-related genes with astrocytic differentially expressed genes from an Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) mouse model displaying reduced astrocyte morphology, as well as in relation to gene expression in AD and other CNS disorders. RESULTS We found several hundred genes that were enriched within and shared among astrocytes in the CNS, with functions related to metabolism, cholesterol, and neurotransmitter uptake and biosynthesis. These genes represent the core functions of astrocytes, but little is known about approximately a third of them, implying that understanding the fundamental physiology of astrocytes across CNS areas is an important ongoing experimental goal. Our data also reveal that astrocytes have molecular features and functions specific to CNS regions, and that these region-specific functions arise from the local tissue environment and by variable representation of seven distinct astrocyte subclusters. We mined our data to identify gene networks related to astrocyte morphology, and unexpectedly discovered several AD risk genes. We developed astrocyte-specific CRISPR/Cas9\u2013based gene knockdown to reduce the expression of such genes in the hippocampus. We found a reduction of astrocyte morphology with changes in a cognitive task after knockdown of key morphology-related genes, indicating that astrocyte morphological changes affect neural circuit function. In addition to AD risk genes that were astrocyte morphology related, we found a significant association between morphology-related genes and those related to several other common CNS disorders. CONCLUSION We provide comprehensive molecular data that will allow many new types of experiments to explore core features of astrocytes across the CNS, in particular, those unique to specific regions and how they relate to the dynamics and biophysics of neural circuits in specific CNS regions. We used our data to identify the molecular underpinnings of astrocyte morphology between CNS regions and to show that reduced astrocyte morphological complexity, and the attendant loss of tissue support, is common to diverse CNS disorders. This raises the prospect that restoring astrocyte morphology, and thus the ensuing neuronal and tissue support functions, may be therapeutically beneficial in disease. Our findings provide the molecular basis to explore such strategies and to unravel the nascent underlying biology determining how astrocytes contribute to CNS function and dysfunction. Astrocyte diversity and morphology across the CNS. (1) Astrocyte morphology and gene expression was measured across CNS regions.

Peroxisomes and pexophagy are essential for balancing oxidative stress and protein degradation products. Our previous findings suggest that peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor \u03b2/\u03b4 (PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4) activation significantly alleviates depressive behaviors by preventing astrocytic injury. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, we established oxidative injury by treating astrocytes with corticosterone. Subsequently, PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 agonists and antagonists were applied to determine the effects of PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 on balancing peroxisomes and pexophagy in astrocytes. The PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 agonist (GW0742) significantly improved cell viability and decreased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production induced by corticosterone, while pretreatment with the PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4, antagonist GSK3787 reversed the effects of GW0742. Moreover, activating PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 promoted peroxisomal biogenesis factor 5 (PEX5)-mediated pexophagy by enhancing the phosphorylation of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase. Conversely, blocking PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 with GSK3787 partially abolished the effects of GW0742. Further investigations demonstrated that activation of PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 not only induced transcription of the ubiquitin protein ligase E3 component n-recognin 5 (UBR5) but also enhanced the interaction between PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 and UBR5, contributing to ATM interactor (ATMIN) degradation, and increased phosphorylated ATM kinase levels. Therefore, this study revealed that activating PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 improves corticosterone-induced oxidative damage in astrocytes by enhancing pexophagy. PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 directly interacts with UBR5 to facilitate ATMIN degradation and promotes ATM phosphorylation, thereby maintaining the balance between peroxisomes and pexophagy.

Patients received pretreatment with obinutuzumab to mitigate cytokine release syndrome, followed by fixed-duration glofitamab monotherapy (12 cycles total). The primary end point was complete response according to assessment by an independent review committee. Key secondary end points included duration of response, survival, and safety.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf the 155 patients who were enrolled, 154 received at least one dose of any study treatment (obinutuzumab or glofitamab). At a median follow-up of 12.6 months, 39% (95% confidence interval [CI], 32 to 48) of the patients had a complete response according to independent review. Results were consistent among the 52 patients who had previously received chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (35% of whom had a complete response). The median time to a complete response was 42 days (95% CI, 42 to 44). The majority (78%) of complete responses were ongoing at 12 months. The 12-month progression-free survival was 37% (95% CI, 28 to 46). Discontinuation of glofitamab due to adverse events occurred in 9% of the patients.

AMR occurs when viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites do not respond to antimicrobial treatments in humans and animals, thus allowing the survival of the microorganism within the host. The prominent cause contributing to the current crisis remains to be the overuse and misuse of antimicrobials, particularly the inappropriate usage of antibiotics, increasing the global burden of antimicrobial resistance. The global consumption and usage of antibiotics are therefore closely monitored at all times. This review provides a current overview of the implications of strategies used by international governmental organisations, including the UN\u2019s 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), to address the problem of antibiotic resistance, as well as the \u201cOne Health Approach,\u201d a system incorporating a multidisciplinary effort to achieve the best possible health outcome by acknowledging the clear connections between humans, animals and their shared environment. The importance of public awareness and health literacy of lay audiences still needs to be further emphasised as part of global and local action plans. Antimicrobial resistance continues to be a major global public health dilemma of the 21st century. Already this topic is receiving substantial political input from the G7 countries and continues to be on the agenda of numerous political conferences. The consequences of failure to adequately address AMR are profound, with estimations of a return to the pre-antibiotic era, where everyday infections relating to childbirth, surgery and open fractured limbs could be potentially life-threatening. AMR itself represents a microcosm of factors, including social anthropology, civil unrest/war, diasporas, ethnic displacement, political systems, healthcare, economics, societal behaviour both at a population and individual level, health literacy, geoclimatic events, global travel and pharmaceutical innovation and investment, thus finding a solution that adequately addresses AMR and which helps stem further AMR emergence is complicated.

Inflammation-induced endothelial dysfunction results in an increased permeability to lipoproteins and their subendothelial accumulation, leukocyte recruitment, and platelets activation. Recruited monocytes differentiate into macrophages which develop pro- or anti-inflammatory properties according to their microenvironment. Atheroma progression or healing is determined by the balance between these functional phenotypes. Macrophages and smooth muscle cells secrete inflammatory cytokines including interleukins IL-1\u03b2, IL-12, and IL-6. Within the arterial wall, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol undergoes an oxidation. Additionally, triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and remnant lipoproteins exert pro-inflammatory effects. Macrophages catabolize the oxidized lipoproteins and coalesce into a lipid-rich necrotic core, encapsulated by a collagen fibrous cap, leading to the formation of fibro-atheroma. In the conditions of chronic inflammation, macrophages exert a catabolic effect on the fibrous cap, resulting in a thin-cap fibro-atheroma which makes the plaque vulnerable. However, their morphology may change over time, shifting from high-risk lesions to more stable calcified plaques. In addition to conventional cardiovascular risk factors, an exposure to acute and chronic psychological stress may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease through inflammation mediated by an increased sympathetic output which results in the release of inflammatory cytokines. Inflammation is also the link between ageing and cardiovascular disease through increased clones of leukocytes in peripheral blood.

This is exemplified by automated external chest compression devices. When first introduced, theoretical models, animal studies, and early clinical trials suggested they could improve survival. Yet, randomized trials failed to confirm this benefit. Similarly, to date, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), therapeutic hypothermia, and primary angioplasty have demonstrated inconsistent survival advantage.

Interestingly, these receptors are expressed in overlapping brain regions. However, the extent to which they target the same neurons and engage in molecular crosstalk remains unclear. To explore the potential colocalization of GHSR and GLP-1R in specific neurons, we performed detailed mapping of cells positive for both receptors using GHSR-eGFP reporter mice or wild-type mice infused with fluorescent ghrelin, alongside an anti-GLP-1R antibody.

The highest overlap was observed in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus, where 15% to 20% of GHSR+ cells were also GLP-1R+ cells. Additionally, we examined RNA-sequencing datasets from mouse and human brains to assess the fraction and distribution of neurons expressing both receptors, finding that double-positive Ghsr+/Glp1r+ cells are highly segregated, with a small subset of double-positive Ghsr+/Glp1r+ cells representing <10% of all Ghsr+ or Glp1r+ cells, primarily enriched in the hypothalamus.

No pharmacological treatment options currently exist for methamphetamine use disorder, and psychotherapy is only moderately effective. Preliminary evidence suggests that ketamine-assisted psychotherapy produces sustained improvements in substance use and mental health symptomatology. In addition to direct antidepressant properties, ketamine is hypothesised to increase synaptogenesis and facilitate neuroplasticity, in turn prolonging and enhancing the effects of psychotherapy. Given the withdrawal-associated dysphoria and neurocognitive impairments characterising methamphetamine use disorder, ketamine-assisted psychotherapy may improve the efficacy of psychotherapy alone by addressing these features and facilitating therapeutic engagement. This pilot study aims to investigate the safety and feasibility (time taken to recruit sample, proportion of ineligible participants at pre-screening and screening, number of participants who complete four sessions of psychotherapy, retention rate over full duration of study, acceptability of the intervention) of subanaesthetic ketamine in combination with psychotherapy (cognitive behavioural therapy) for adults with methamphetamine use disorder. Changes in methamphetamine use, cravings and withdrawal, quality of life, and treatment satisfaction will also be explored. Methods and analysis This is an open-label, single-arm clinical trial. 20 adults meeting DSM-5-TR criteria for methamphetamine use disorder who are seeking to reduce or cease methamphetamine use will be enrolled in the study through a single-site specialist outpatient stimulant treatment service in inner Sydney (St Vincent\u2019s Hospital, Sydney). A 4-week course with three subcutaneous ketamine doses (0.75 mg/kg to 0.9 mg/kg, titrated according to tolerability) at weekly intervals and four sessions of cognitive behavioural therapy (one at treatment initiation and three within 24\u201348 hours following each ketamine administration session) will be delivered. Safety and feasibility will be assessed over an 8-week period. Secondary outcomes (changes in methamphetamine use, cravings, withdrawal, quality of life and treatment satisfaction) will be assessed over a 24-week period.

The absence of a consensus definition hampers precise estimates of the prevalence of TRD, and also belies efforts to identify risk factors, prevention opportunities, and effective interventions. In addition, it results in heterogeneity in clinical practice decision\u2010making, adversely affecting quality of care. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) have adopted the most used definition of TRD (i.e., inadequate response to a minimum of two antidepressants despite adequacy of the treatment trial and adherence to treatment). It is currently estimated that at least 30% of persons with depression meet this definition. A significant percentage of persons with TRD are actually pseudo\u2010resistant (e.g., due to inadequacy of treatment trials or non\u2010adherence to treatment). Although multiple sociodemographic, clinical, treatment and contextual factors are known to negatively moderate response in persons with depression, very few factors are regarded as predictive of non\u2010response across multiple modalities of treatment. Intravenous ketamine and intranasal esketamine (co\u2010administered with an antidepressant) are established as efficacious in the management of TRD. Some second\u2010generation antipsychotics (e.g., aripiprazole, brexpiprazole, cariprazine, quetiapine XR) are proven effective as adjunctive treatments to antidepressants in partial responders, but only the olanzapine\u2010fluoxetine combination has been studied in FDA\u2010defined TRD. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is established as effective and FDA\u2010approved for individuals with TRD, with accelerated theta\u2010burst TMS also recently showing efficacy. Electroconvulsive therapy is regarded as an effective acute and maintenance intervention in TRD, with preliminary evidence suggesting non\u2010inferiority to acute intravenous ketamine. Evidence for extending antidepressant trial, medication switching and combining antidepressants is mixed. Manual\u2010based psychotherapies are not established as efficacious on their own in TRD, but offer significant symptomatic relief when added to conventional antidepressants.

Heavy metal ions are toxic, potentially carcinogenic, and can bioaccumulate in biological systems. Heavy metals can cause harm to various organs, including the neurological system, liver, lungs, kidneys, stomach, skin, and reproductive systems, even at low exposure levels. Efforts to find efficient methods to remove heavy metals from wastewater have increased in recent years. Although some approaches can effectively remove heavy metal contaminants, their high preparation and usage costs may limit their practical applications.

Ecological and hygienic assessment of the quality of drinking water at the centralized water supply of industrial cities of the Dnipropetrovsk region by the content of trace elements from the group of heavy metals. Object and research methods. The analysis of the content of trace elements from the group of heavy metals in the drinking water of industrial cities of the Dnipropetrovsk region - Dnipro, Kryvyi Rih, Kamianske over a 5-year period was carried out. The evaluation of the obtained data was carried out in accordance with the requirements of the current legislation on the safety and quality of drinking water in accordance with SSRN 2.2.4-171-10, international recommendations and data from the scientific literature. Results. It has been established that in the Dnipropetrovs'k region over the 5-year study period, the percentage of non-standard drinking water samples for sanitary and chemical parameters ranged from 24.4-30.6% from centralized water supply systems, and 14.5-18.4% from water supply networks. The average long-term concentrations of metals in the drinking water of the studied cities ranged from 0.0001 mg/l for mercury to 0.19 mg/l for aluminum, which meets the MAC requirements, but the maximum values of the content of individual metals in all industrial cities exceeded the hygienic regulations, most pronounced for iron, which reached 60%. At the same time, the proportion of samples exceeding the hygienic standard in some years of the study was 5-12%. In the dynamics of the study, a gradual decrease of 14.2-54.5% in the concentration of lead in drinking water in all industrial and control cities was noted (p<0.05; R2= 0.51-0.78). A similar trend is also characteristic of the aluminum content in drinking water in Kryvyi Rih - a 2.5-fold decrease (p<0.001; R2=0.79) during the study period. At the same time, a significant increase in the content of a number of trace elements from the group of biotic and abiotic heavy metals was found in Kamianske, in particular copper and zinc - by 2.0-2.4 times (p<0.01; R2= 0.72-0.77), mercury and arsenic - by 1.3-1.9 times (p<0.01; R2= 0.87-0.92). The dynamics of concentrations of other heavy metals in the drinking water of the studied cities was unreliable. The sum of the ratio of the concentrations of trace elements from the group of heavy metals belonging to hazard classes I and II according to the sanitary and toxicological limiting sign of harmfulness ranges from 1.1 to 1.9, i.e. the simultaneous presence of these metals in the drinking water of industrial cities exceeds the safe level regulated by SSRN 2.2.4-171-10. Conclusions. The results of the conducted research indicate the urgency of the problem of ensuring the quality and safety of drinking water intended for human consumption and the need for further improvement of water treatment and control methods at all levels.

Underdiagnosis, coupled with the economic and social burden of dementia, necessitates more precise detection methods. Machine learning (ML) algorithms show promise in managing complex data for MCI and dementia prediction. Objective This study assessed the predictive accuracy of ML models in identifying the onset of MCI and dementia using the Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging (KLoSA) dataset. Methods This study used data from the KLoSA, a comprehensive biennial survey that tracks the demographic, health, and socioeconomic aspects of middle-aged and older Korean adults from 2018 to 2020. Among the 6171 initial households, 4975 eligible older adult participants aged 60 years or older were selected after excluding individuals based on age and missing data. The identification of MCI and dementia relied on self-reported diagnoses, with sociodemographic and health-related variables serving as key covariates. The dataset was categorized into training and test sets to predict MCI and dementia by using multiple models, including logistic regression, light gradient-boosting machine, XGBoost (extreme gradient boosting), CatBoost, random forest, gradient boosting, AdaBoost, support vector classifier, and k-nearest neighbors, and the training and test sets were used to evaluate predictive performance. The performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Class imbalances were addressed via weights. Shapley additive explanation values were used to determine the contribution of each feature to the prediction rate. Results Among the 4975 participants, the best model for predicting MCI onset was random forest, with a median AUC of 0.6729 (IQR 0.3883-0.8152), followed by k-nearest neighbors with a median AUC of 0.5576 (IQR 0.4555-0.6761) and support vector classifier with a median AUC of 0.5067 (IQR 0.3755-0.6389). For dementia onset prediction, the best model was XGBoost, achieving a median AUC of 0.8185 (IQR 0.8085-0.8285), closely followed by light gradient-boosting machine with a median AUC of 0.8069 (IQR 0.7969-0.8169) and AdaBoost with a median AUC of 0.8007 (IQR 0.7907-0.8107). The Shapley values highlighted pain in everyday life, being widowed, living alone, exercising, and living with a partner as the strongest predictors of MCI. For dementia, the most predictive features were other contributing factors, education at the high school level, education at the middle school level, exercising, and monthly social engagement. Conclusions ML algorithms, especially XGBoost, exhibited the potential for predicting MCI onset using KLoSA data. However, no model has demonstrated robust accuracy in predicting MCI and dementia. Sociodemographic and health-related factors are crucial for initiating cognitive conditions, emphasizing the need for multifaceted predictive models for early identification and intervention.

Socio\u2010demographic and health\u2010related characteristics were compared across the identified physical frailty trajectories using bivariate analyses, employing Rao\u2013Scott chi\u2010square tests for categorical variables and design\u2010based F\u2010tests for continuous variables. Multinomial logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the relationships between different frailty trajectories and subsequent dementia status. Results Three frailty trajectories were identified: low\u2010stable (74.00%), low\u2010increasing (21.14%), and high\u2010level (4.86%). Participants in the low\u2010increasing and high\u2010level groups were predominantly older, female, minorities, unmarried, and less educated and had a lower income, more comorbidities, and greater anxiety and depression symptoms (p < 0.001). Compared with the low\u2010stable group, older adults in the low\u2010increasing group had higher risk of possible dementia (RRR: 2.37, 95% CI: 1.41\u20133.97, p < 0.001) and probable dementia (RRR: 1.71, 95% CI: 1.08\u20132.73, p = 0.02); similarly, older adults in the high\u2010level group had higher risks of possible dementia (RRR: 4.24, 95% CI: 1.74\u201310.36, p < 0.001) and probable dementia (RRR: 2.99, 95% CI: 1.32\u20136.76, p = 0.01). No significant differences were found in the risk of dementia between the high\u2010level frailty group and the low\u2010increasing frailty group (p > 0.05).

With 890,000 new cases and 450,000 deaths annually per GLOBOCAN estimates, HNSCC accounts for roughly 4.5% of cancer diagnoses and deaths. In the developing world, the incidence of HNSCC is growing with increasing consumption of tobacco (smoked or chewed), alcohol, and areca nut (betel quid). Alcohol and tobacco have a synergistic effect, with the heavy consumption of both increasing HNSCC risk 40-fold. In developed nations, HPV-related HNSCC surpasses tobacco- and alcohol-related disease. HPV-related HNSCC more commonly affects the oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx than the oral cavity, and is associated with a significantly longer median survival (130 months vs. 20 months). Discrepancies in etiology as well as disparities in lifestyle choices and access to healthcare may account for the greater incidence and poorer survival of HNSCC among minority and lower-socioeconomic-status communities in developed nations. Pharmacotherapy and counseling together have been shown to be effective in promoting smoking and alcohol cessation. Education on cancer risk and community engagement have reduced areca nut consumption in Asia as well as in diaspora communities. HPV vaccination, starting at age 11\u201312 for both sexes, has been shown to reduce the prevalence of high-risk HPV serologies and prevent pre-cancerous lesions of the cervix, vagina, and vulva.

The management of obesity before the development of its comorbidities may prevent its escalation into significant medical and psychosocial problems. However, treatment options for obesity and T2D in youth remained limited for many years, and moreover, available drugs were characterized by low efficacy. The Treatment Options for Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth (TODAY) study showed that metformin in monotherapy failed in almost 52% of children with T2D, while adjuncts to rosiglitazone and lifestyle intervention failed in 38.6% and 46.6%, respectively.

Second, to identify countries where antimicrobial-stewardship efforts should be targeted to curb antimicrobial resistance.

Antibiotics and other pharmaceuticals are increasingly detected in surface groundwater, and drinking water, raising concerns about their potential adverse impacts on ecosystems and human health. Standard wastewater treatment methods often fail to effectively remove these compounds, particularly small organic molecules like tetracycline antibiotics, leading to their persistence in the environment. To address this issue, continuous monitoring and surveillance are necessary, including regular analysis of wastewater. Modern analytical methods, such as high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometric detection (HPLC-MS), allow detecting trace concentrations. This work presents a new method for qualitative and quantitative analysis using a quadrupole mass analyzer, which can serve as an alternative to tandem mass spectrometry. \nMaterials and methods. Tetracycline antibiotics (oxytetracycline, tetracycline, chlortetracycline, and doxycycline) in aquatic environments were detercted using selected ion monitoring (HPLC-MS) and selected reaction monitoring through tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). \nResults. There have been established chromatographic and mass spectrometric criteria for the identification of tetracyclines, determining key operating parameters for the quadrupole, such as selected ion scanning based on mass-to-charge ratio (m/z), signal registration time, and duration. The developed method for analyzing tetracyclines using a quadrupole mass analyzer demonstrates analytical characteristics comparable to tandem mass spectrometry based on a triple quadrupole mass analyzer. The method was validated on a quadrupole mass analyzer during the analysis of water samples from natural sources (drinking water, centralized water supply, and treated wastewater). In this analytical approach, the sample preparation process was simplified, allowing for the assessment of antibiotic content in samples without the need for labour-intensive solid-phase extraction and concentration, starting from 1 ng/ml and above ( for various types of water mactrices). \nLimitations. In this study, only the intact forms of tetracyclines were identified. Separate investigations into the detection of their chemical transformation products and epimerization were not conducted. The presented approach can be applied for analyzing wastewater and assessing the quality of its treatment, where the concentration of tetracycline antibiotics as micro-pollutants may exceed 10 ng/ml. \nConclusion. The proposed analytical method using a single quadrupole mass analyzer can serve as an alternative to the more expensive tandem mass spectrometer, both in terms of acquisition cost and maintenance. Key analytical characteristics that are important for environmental monitoring, such as selectivity and sensitivity, can be enhanced by optimizing the selected ion scanning mode. This was successfully demonstrated in the analysis of tetracyclines in aquatic environments. This approach could serve as a foundation for developing methodologies for detecting pharmaceutical compounds in environmental water samples using a quadrupole mass spectrometer.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-01-31", "synthetic_support_claim": "The single quadrupole mass analyzer is effective for detecting tetracyclines in water, comparable to tandem MS.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Antibiotics in surface water significantly contribute to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in humans."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "0cafe47819509d68c2d1581581949e8558ebc293", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0cafe47819509d68c2d1581581949e8558ebc293", "title": "Merits and Limitations of Radical vs. Nonradical Pathways in Persulfate-Based Advanced Oxidation Processes.", "abstract": "Urbanization and industrialization have exerted significant adverse effects on water quality, resulting in a growing need for reliable and eco-friendly treatment technologies.

Our comparative analysis of reaction rate constants for radical vs. nonradical species indicates that radical-based AOPs may achieve high removal efficiency of organic contaminants with relatively short contact time. Nonradical AOPs feature advantages with minimal water matrix interference for complex wastewater treatments. Nonradical species (e.g., singlet oxygen, high-valent metals, and surface activated PS) preferentially react with contaminants bearing electron-donating groups, allowing enhancement of degradation efficiency of known target contaminants. For byproduct formation, analytical limitations and computational chemistry applications are also considered. Finally, we propose a holistically estimated electrical energy per order of reaction (EE/O) parameter and show significantly higher energy requirements for the nonradical pathways. Overall, these critical comparisons help prioritize basic research on PS-based AOPs and inform the merits and limitations of system-specific applications.", "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-08-03", "synthetic_support_claim": "Radical-based AOPs may achieve high removal efficiency of organic contaminants with relatively short contact time.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Nonradical AOPs are universally more efficient than radical AOPs for all types of wastewater treatment."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "d143a82b961e4daf99e1645ef490ff18ef149e7f", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d143a82b961e4daf99e1645ef490ff18ef149e7f", "title": "Crystalline\u2010Amorphous Hybrid of MoS2 for Enhanced Piezo\u2010catalytic Activation of Peroxomonosulfate Toward Organic Pollutants Degradation", "abstract": "Despite the promising potential of piezo\u2010catalysis in environmental remediation applications, the performance of various piezoelectric materials still suffer from low carrier concentrations, limited carrier mobility, and rapid recombination of electron\u2010hole pairs, and the reported modification strategies are quite intricate and challenging to implement.

Antibiotic use in animal production and the subsequent export of antibiotic resistance elements in animal manure to soil is a concern. Recent reports suggest that exposure of pathogenic bacteria to glyphosate increases antibiotic resistance. We review these reports and identify soil processes likely to affect the persistence of glyphosate, antibiotic resistance elements, and their interactions. The herbicide molecular target of glyphosate is not shared by antibiotics, indicating that target\u2010site cross\u2010resistance cannot account for increased antibiotic resistance. The mechanisms of bacterial resistance to glyphosate and antibiotics differ, and bacterial tolerance or resistance to glyphosate does not coincide with increased resistance to antibiotics. Glyphosate in the presence of antibiotics can increase the activity of efflux pumps, which confer tolerance to glyphosate, allowing for an increased frequency of mutation for antibiotic resistance. Such effects are not unique to glyphosate, as other herbicides and chemical pollutants can have the same effect, although glyphosate is used in much larger quantities on agricultural soils than most other chemicals. Most evidence indicates that glyphosate is not mutagenic in bacteria. Some studies suggest that glyphosate enhances genetic exchange of antibiotic\u2010resistance elements through effects on membrane permeability. Glyphosate and antibiotics are often present together in manure\u2010treated soil for at least part of the crop\u2010growing season, and initial studies indicate that glyphosate may increase abundance of antibiotic resistance genes in soil, but longer term investigations under realistic field conditions are needed. Although there are demonstratable interactions among glyphosate, bacteria, and antibiotic resistance, there is limited evidence that normal use of glyphosate poses a substantial risk for increased occurrence of antibiotic\u2010resistant, bacterial pathogens.

Excessive exposure to antibiotics and the development of resistance mechanisms to antibacterial agents have provoked the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Significant efforts are currently being made to counteract the proliferation of resistant strains by identifying bacteria capable of synthesising antibiotics, discovering new chemical variations in their formulations, and combining natural antibiotics with previously unknown natural sources of antibiotics. Bacteriocins of lactic acid bacteria, peptides or proteins with antibacterial properties, are attracting considerable attention. Selenium is a vital trace element for maintaining health and promoting growth that can be used synergistically with oral antibiotic therapy and as an important component of the diet, and selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) have antioxidant, antitumor, antibacterial properties and significant antibacterial efficacy. Thus, the aim of the study was to investigate the literature data on methods of extraction and purification of enterocin, chemical synthesis of selenium nanohybrids, their characterization using various methods, and assessment of their biological activity. The analysis of literature data confirmed the production of selenium in its chemically pure state. The negative value of the zeta potential of Se nanoparticles was demonstrated, which contributes to their electrical stability and ability to be uniformly distributed in solutions without the formation of aggregates or precipitates. The formation of nanohybrids after the addition of protein shows a tendency to positive values, indicating a significant effect of protein on the surface characteristics of SeNPs. The antibacterial activity of enterocin was studied. It was established that the effectiveness of synthesized selenium nanoparticles (SeNP) against the studied bacteria was lower than that of the synthesized nanohybrid. The study of the antioxidant activity of nanohybrids showed that nanohybrids can absorb free radicals in a larger range than enterocin alone. Thus, the literature data illustrate the enhanced antioxidant activity of the nanohybrid in vitro and better antibacterial activity against MDR bacteria compared to enterocin alone, which indicates the possibility of its use in various industries, in particular in the food and medical industries. The article studied publications only on the in vitro antibacterial and antioxidant effects of enterocin and nanohybrids. At the same time, there is a need for research to study additional effects of the bioactivity of nanohybrids as antifungal and antitumor agents.\nKey words: Selenium nanoparticles, bacteria, antibacterial activity, antioxidant, bacteriocins.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-11-28", "synthetic_support_claim": "Synthesized selenium nanohybrids show better antibacterial and antioxidant activity than enterocin alone against MDR bacteria.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Selenium nanoparticles improve human gut microbiota health when used synergistically with oral antibiotic therapy."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "2b79396dc3b04baaa4815470bcc6c63684e9ce75", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2b79396dc3b04baaa4815470bcc6c63684e9ce75", "title": "Advancements in Nanomedicine for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Kidney Stones", "abstract": "Abstract Kidney stones constitute a common condition impacting the urinary system.

Carbon emissions from this degradation total up to 0.2 petagrams of carbon per year (Pg C year\u22121), which is equivalent to, if not greater than, the emissions from Amazon deforestation (0.06 to 0.21 Pg C year\u22121). Amazon forest degradation can reduce dry-season evapotranspiration by up to 34% and cause as much biodiversity loss as deforestation in human-modified landscapes, generating uneven socioeconomic burdens, mainly to forest dwellers. Projections indicate that degradation will remain a dominant source of carbon emissions independent of deforestation rates. Policies to tackle degradation should be integrated with efforts to curb deforestation and complemented with innovative measures addressing the disturbances that degrade the Amazon forest. Description Losing the Amazon The Amazon rainforest is a biodiversity hotspot under threat from ongoing land conversion and climate change. Two Analytical Reviews in this issue synthesize data on forest loss and degradation in the Amazon basin, providing a clearer picture of its current status and future prospects. Albert et al. reviewed the drivers of change in the Amazon and show that anthropogenic changes are occurring much faster than naturally occurring environmental changes of the past. Although deforestation has been widely documented in the Amazon, degradation is also having major impacts on biodiversity and carbon storage. Lapola et al. synthesized the drivers and outcomes of Amazon forest degradation from timber extraction and habitat fragmentation, fires, and drought. \u2014BEL Two Reviews spotlight the threats of ongoing deforestation and degradation in the Amazon. BACKGROUND Most analyses of land-use and land-cover change in the Amazon forest have focused on the causes and effects of deforestation. However, anthropogenic disturbances cause degradation of the remaining Amazon forest and threaten their future. Among such disturbances, the most important are edge effects (due to deforestation and the resulting habitat fragmentation), timber extraction, fire, and extreme droughts that have been intensified by human-induced climate change. We synthesize knowledge on these disturbances that lead to Amazon forest degradation, including their causes and impacts, possible future extents, and some of the interventions required to curb them. ADVANCES Analysis of existing data on the extent of fire, edge effects, and timber extraction between 2001 and 2018 reveals that 0.36 \u00d7106 km2 (5.5%) of the Amazon forest is under some form of degradation, which corresponds to 112% of the total area deforested in that period. Adding data on extreme droughts increases the estimate of total degraded area to 2.5 \u00d7106 km2, or 38% of the remaining Amazonian forests. Estimated carbon loss from these forest disturbances ranges from 0.05 to 0.20 Pg C year\u22121 and is comparable to carbon loss from deforestation (0.06 to 0.21 Pg C year\u22121). Disturbances can bring about as much biodiversity loss as deforestation itself, and forests degraded by fire and timber extraction can have a 2 to 34% reduction in dry-season evapotranspiration. The underlying drivers of disturbances (e.g., agricultural expansion or demand for timber) generate material benefits for a restricted group of regional and global actors, whereas the burdens permeate across a broad range of scales and social groups ranging from nearby forest dwellers to urban residents of Andean countries. First-order 2050 projections indicate that the four main disturbances will remain a major threat and source of carbon fluxes to the atmosphere, independent of deforestation trajectories. OUTLOOK Whereas some disturbances such as edge effects can be tackled by curbing deforestation, others, like constraining the increase in extreme droughts, require additional measures, including global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Curbing degradation will also require engaging with the diverse set of actors that promote it, operationalizing effective monitoring of different disturbances, and refining policy frameworks such as REDD+. These will all be supported by rapid and multidisciplinary advances in our socioenvironmental understanding of tropical forest degradation, providing a robust platform on which to co-construct appropriate policies and programs to curb it.

These cyclical changes necessitate a high degree of adaptability among fish species, many of which have evolved specialized strategies to cope with the fluctuating conditions. In 2023, the Amazon basin experienced a record-breaking drought event, leading to mass mortality of Amazonian fish and other wildlife. This study examines the effect of this extreme event on fish condition in white-water (Rio Solim\u00f5es basin) and black-water (Rio Negro basin) floodplain lakes. These contrasting environments provide a unique opportunity to study how different water qualities and extreme water-level fluctuations impact fish condition. Research was conducted during the normal low-water period in November 2019 and the drastically decreased water levels in November 2023. The main objective was to understand how extreme water-level fluctuations affect fish health and nutritional status. A total of 585 fishes were analyzed, with 294 from white-water and 291 from black-water, representing different feeding types to provide a comprehensive picture of changes in fish condition. Water-level changes had a statistically significant impact on fish condition in both areas. Comparing low-water and extreme low-water levels, fish condition was consistently higher during the normal low-water period. The linear mixed-effects model revealed that the intensity of the low-water season had a significant effect on fish length-adjusted mass, suggesting that the decrease in water level is associated with an overall decrease in fish length-adjusted mass. When comparing the mean water-level effect (Glass's \u0394) between low-water and extreme low-water levels, we found a bigger effect in the black-water system than in the white-water system.

The prevention methods can significantly slow AD evolution and are currently the best strategy possible before the advanced stages of the disease.

Early diagnosis of plant disease is critical to increasing agricultural crop productivity. In this paper, a new robust hybrid classification model based on swarm optimization-supported feature selection, including machine learning and deep learning algorithms, that allows real-time classification of diseases in apple, grape, and tomato plants has been developed. In this way, it will be possible to diagnose the plant disease at an early phase and apply the appropriate treatment. Abstract The early detection and prevention of plant diseases that are an important cause of famine and food insecurity worldwide are very important for increasing agricultural product productivity. Not only the early detection of the plant disease but also the determination of its type play a critical role in determining the appropriate treatment. The fact that visual inspection, which is frequently used in determining plant disease and types, is tiring and prone to human error, necessitated the development of algorithms that can automatically classify plant disease with high accuracy and low computational cost. In this study, a new hybrid plant leaf disease classification model with high accuracy and low computational complexity, consisting of the wrapper approach, including the flower pollination algorithm (FPA) and support vector machine (SVM), and a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier, is developed with a wrapper-based feature selection approach using metaheuristic optimization techniques. The features of the image dataset consisting of apple, grape, and tomato plants have been extracted by a two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform (2D-DWT) using wavelet families such as biorthogonal, Coiflets, Daubechies, Fejer\u2013Korovkin, and symlets. Features that keep classifier performance high for each family are selected by the wrapper approach, consisting of the population-based metaheuristics FPA and SVM. The performance of the proposed optimization algorithm is compared with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Afterwards, the classification performance is obtained by using the lowest number of features that can keep the classification performance high for the CNN classifier. The CNN classifier with a single layer of classification without a feature extraction layer is used to minimize the complexity of the model and to deal with the model hyperparameter problem. The obtained model is embedded in the NVIDIA Jetson Nano developer kit on the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and real-time classification tests are performed on apple, grape, and tomato plants. The experimental results obtained show that the proposed model classifies the specified plant leaf diseases in real time with high accuracy. Moreover, it is concluded that the robust hybrid classification model, which is created by selecting the lowest number of features with the optimization algorithm with low computational complexity, can classify plant leaf diseases in real time with precision.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-11-29", "synthetic_support_claim": "The proposed model classifies apple, grape, and tomato plant leaf diseases in real time accurately.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "The hybrid model can diagnose plant diseases in all types of plants with high accuracy."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "cda1e218bccc8173a50efa48c4bf28cde007819f", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cda1e218bccc8173a50efa48c4bf28cde007819f", "title": "General retrieval network model for multi-class plant leaf diseases based on hashing", "abstract": "Traditional disease retrieval and localization for plant leaves typically demand substantial human resources and time.

This research utilizes vessel position data with a spatial resolution of 0.1\u00b0 \u00d7 0.1\u00b0 and monthly temporal resolution, creating a more refined dataset.

Rising temperatures, shifting weather patterns, and increased frequency of natural disasters are driving the emergence and spread of infectious diseases, particularly zoonotic and vector-borne diseases. These environmental shifts endanger the health and welfare of animals and the delicate balance between human populations, livestock, and wildlife. As the stewards of animal health, veterinarians are uniquely positioned to lead the change in addressing these complex challenges at the nexus of human, animal, and environmental health and well-being. This article calls for urgent actions to integrate climate adaptation and mitigation strategies into veterinary practice and education. It underscores the critical need for veterinarians to embrace the One Health approach to tackle climate-driven disease outbreaks and the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance to safeguard human and animal populations while protecting natural ecosystems. The article further explores the role of veterinarians in fostering sustainable agricultural practices, reducing the environmental impact of livestock production, conserving biodiversity and advocating for policy reforms that protect both animal and planetary health. As we face an era of unprecedented climate disruption, this call to action aims to inspire the global veterinary community to actively get involved in combating climate change and its worst impacts.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have been proved to provide additional benefit in disease control. However, oncological outcome of iCCA remains poor and awaits further improvement with new treatment modalities. Promising results have been observed in lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab (Len-P) as a second-line therapy in iCCA. This study aimed to explore the safety and efficacy of Len-P as a first-line therapy for iCCA patients in real-world clinical practice. Methods We retrospectively enrolled 133 patients with advanced iCCA who received Len-P or SC between May 2019 and May 2023. Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and adverse events (AEs) were compared between the two groups. Results There were 72 patients and 61 patients in the Len-P and SC groups, respectively. The median OS for the Len-P and SC groups was 16.3 and 17.8 months, respectively. The median PFS for the Len-P and SC groups was 8.9 and 11.4 months, respectively. There was no significant difference in ORR and DCR between the Len-P and SC groups (ORR: 22.2% vs. 23%; P=0.92; DCR: 69.4% vs. 77%; P=0.58). Additionally, the overall incidence of AEs was lower in the Len-P group than SC group. Low inflammation-based scores were indicative of favorable outcomes in patients undergoing Len-P therapy.

Aberrant epigenetic events contribute most to the progression of CHOL and chemotherapy efficacy. PHF10, one subunit of SWI/SNF complex, expressed highly in tumours that correlated with tumorigenesis. However, the roles of PHF10 in CHOL remains unclear. Here, we utilised the bioinformatic analysis to reveal that PHF10 expressed lowly in CHOL samples relative to normal tissues. Functionally, we demonstrated that PHF10 deficiency enhanced cell proliferation, migration and self\u2010renewal capacities of CHOL cells. PHF10 ablation further enhanced the chemoresistance of CHOL cells. The transcriptome analysis revealed that PHF10\u2010KO could notably alter several oncogenic crosstalk, including the NF\u2010kB signalling. As the top hit, HMGB1 mRNA expressions had the sharpest increase upon PHF10 deficiency. PHF10 coordinated with Setdb1 to mediate the H3K9me3 modifications on the HMGB1 promoter to suppress its expressions. Low PHF10 relied on HMGB1 to promote the progression of CHOL cells in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, EZH2 mediated the H3K27me3 enrichment on the PHF10 promoter region that contributes to its low expressions. Lastly, the HMGB1 inhibitor (Glycyrrhizin) decreased proliferation rate of PHF10\u2010deleted cells in vitro and in vivo. Targeting HMGB1 rendered PHF10low CHOL re\u2010sensitive to chemotherapy. Collectively, this study demonstrated that PHF10 functions as a tumour suppressor in CHOL, and is a novel target to predict and overcome chemoresistance.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-01", "synthetic_support_claim": "PHF10 functions as a tumour suppressor in cholangiocarcinoma and influences chemotherapy resistance.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "PHF10 overexpression promotes chemoresistance in cholangiocarcinoma."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "a93439ae841a4c0d8d7135c1d2fe858eace0e07d", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a93439ae841a4c0d8d7135c1d2fe858eace0e07d", "title": "Epcoritamab, a Novel, Subcutaneous CD3xCD20 Bispecific T-Cell\u2013Engaging Antibody, in Relapsed or Refractory Large B-Cell Lymphoma: Dose Expansion in a Phase I/II Trial", "abstract": "PURPOSE Epcoritamab is a subcutaneously administered CD3xCD20 T-cell\u2013engaging, bispecific antibody that activates T cells, directing them to kill malignant CD20+ B cells.

Patients with HFpEF are hospitalized approximately 1.4 times per year and have an annual mortality rate of approximately 15%.\n\n\nObservations\nRisk factors for HFpEF include older age, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and obesity. Approximately 65% of patients with HFpEF present with dyspnea and physical examination, chest radiographic, echocardiographic, or invasive hemodynamic evidence of HF with overt congestion (volume overload) at rest. Approximately 35% of patients with HFpEF present with \"unexplained\" dyspnea on exertion, meaning they do not have clear physical, radiographic, or echocardiographic signs of HF. These patients have elevated atrial pressures with exercise as measured with invasive hemodynamic stress testing or estimated with Doppler echocardiography stress testing. In unselected patients presenting with unexplained dyspnea, the H2FPEF score incorporating clinical (age, hypertension, obesity, atrial fibrillation status) and resting Doppler echocardiographic (estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure or left atrial pressure) variables can assist with diagnosis (H2FPEF score range, 0-9; score >5 indicates more than 95% probability of HFpEF). Specific causes of the clinical syndrome of HF with normal EF other than HFpEF should be identified and treated, such as valvular, infiltrative, or pericardial disease. First-line pharmacologic therapy consists of sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitors, such as dapagliflozin or empagliflozin, which reduced HF hospitalization or cardiovascular death by approximately 20% compared with placebo in randomized clinical trials. Compared with usual care, exercise training and diet-induced weight loss produced clinically meaningful increases in functional capacity and quality of life in randomized clinical trials.

Patients were randomly assigned to receive one of four doses of olpasiran (10 mg every 12 weeks, 75 mg every 12 weeks, 225 mg every 12 weeks, or 225 mg every 24 weeks) or matching placebo, administered subcutaneously. The primary end point was the percent change in the lipoprotein(a) concentration from baseline to week 36 (reported as the placebo-adjusted mean percent change). Safety was also assessed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAmong the 281 enrolled patients, the median concentration of lipoprotein(a) at baseline was 260.3 nmol per liter, and the median concentration of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was 67.5 mg per deciliter. At baseline, 88% of the patients were taking statin therapy, 52% were taking ezetimibe, and 23% were taking a proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor. At 36 weeks, the lipoprotein(a) concentration had increased by a mean of 3.6% in the placebo group, whereas olpasiran therapy had significantly and substantially reduced the lipoprotein(a) concentration in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in placebo-adjusted mean percent changes of -70.5% with the 10-mg dose, -97.4% with the 75-mg dose, -101.1% with the 225-mg dose administered every 12 weeks, and -100.5% with the 225-mg dose administered every 24 weeks (P<0.001 for all comparisons with baseline). The overall incidence of adverse events was similar across the trial groups.

Four hundred questionnaires were distributed, and the response rate was 78.5% (n = 314). The majority of the participants were females (52.5%), Saudis (89.2%), and employees of MOH (77.1%). The mean age for the participants was 35.6 \u00b1 7.8 years. Quantitative analysis revealed high AI awareness scores with a mean of 3.96 \u00b1 0.167, p < 0.001, and low previous experience scores with a mean of 2.65 \u00b1 0.292. Data management-related worries came out as the top worry, with a mean of 3.78 \u00b1 0.259, while the poor data entry impact topped with a mean of 4.15 \u00b1 0.801; healthcare provider-related worries with a mean of 3.71 \u00b1 0.182; and regulation/ethics-related worries with a mean of 3.67 \u00b1 0.145. Health professionals\u2019 main concerns about AI adoption were related to data reliability and impacts on clinical decision-making, which significantly hindered successful AI integration in healthcare. These are the particular concerns that, if addressed through robust data management protocols and enhanced processes for clinical validation, will afford the best implementation of AI technology in an optimized way to bring better quality and safety to healthcare.

However, limited evidence exists regarding the readiness of health science students, particularly in northern Saudi Arabia (KSA), to integrate AI into their future practices, highlighting the need for focused evaluation. We evaluated northern Saudi health science students\u2019 knowledge, attitude, practice, and associated factors toward AI. Participants and Methods The present cross-sectional study was conducted among 384 health science students aged 18 years and above from Jouf University, KSA. The study employed a validated data collection form with four sections: demographics, knowledge (AI principles and applications), attitudes (perceptions and ethical concerns), and practices (usage and confidence in AI tools). The three domains\u2019 scores were categorized as low (<60%), medium (60\u201380%) and high (>80%) based on their total scores. We utilized Spearman correlation test to ascertain the strength and direction of correlation among each subscale. Additionally, multivariate analysis was employed to identify associated factors. Results The present study demonstrated low knowledge, attitude, and practices among 55.7%, 37.0%, and 50.3% of health science students. We observed a positive correlation between knowledge and attitude (rho = 0.451, p = 0.001), knowledge and practice (rho = 0.353, p = 0.001), and attitude and practice (rho = 0.651, p = 0.001). Knowledge (p = 0.001) and practice (p = 0.002) were significantly higher among the students who participated in a formal AI training program. Females had a significantly higher level of attitude (p = 0.001) and practice (p = 0.030) than males. Conclusion In light of these findings, refining the curriculum to incorporate AI emerges as a critical strategy for addressing gaps in AI knowledge, attitudes, and practices among health science students. Therefore, formal and integrated training programs tailored to suit the local setting can effectively prepare health science students to adopt AI technologies in ways that enhance patient care.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-01", "synthetic_support_claim": "Females had a significantly higher level of attitude (p = 0.001) and practice (p = 0.030) than males.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "AI integration improves patient outcomes in healthcare settings."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "6b9080e1e96b5f6e139458dc56f81ed1a5ff3170", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6b9080e1e96b5f6e139458dc56f81ed1a5ff3170", "title": "Efficacy and safety of COVID\u201019 vaccines", "abstract": "Abstract Background Different forms of vaccines have been developed to prevent the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 virus and subsequent COVID\u201019 disease. Several are in widespread use globally. Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of COVID\u201019 vaccines (as a full primary vaccination series or a booster dose) against SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. Search methods We searched the Cochrane COVID\u201019 Study Register and the COVID\u201019 L\u00b7OVE platform (last search date 5 November 2021). We also searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, regulatory agency websites, and Retraction Watch. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing COVID\u201019 vaccines to placebo, no vaccine, other active vaccines, or other vaccine schedules. Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methods. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for all except immunogenicity outcomes. We synthesized data for each vaccine separately and presented summary effect estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Main results We included and analyzed 41 RCTs assessing 12 different vaccines, including homologous and heterologous vaccine schedules and the effect of booster doses. Thirty\u2010two RCTs were multicentre and five were multinational. The sample sizes of RCTs were 60 to 44,325 participants. Participants were aged: 18 years or older in 36 RCTs; 12 years or older in one RCT; 12 to 17 years in two RCTs; and three to 17 years in two RCTs. Twenty\u2010nine RCTs provided results for individuals aged over 60 years, and three RCTs included immunocompromized patients. No trials included pregnant women. Sixteen RCTs had two\u2010month follow\u2010up or less, 20 RCTs had two to six months, and five RCTs had greater than six to 12 months or less. Eighteen reports were based on preplanned interim analyses. Overall risk of bias was low for all outcomes in eight RCTs, while 33 had concerns for at least one outcome. We identified 343 registered RCTs with results not yet available. This abstract reports results for the critical outcomes of confirmed symptomatic COVID\u201019, severe and critical COVID\u201019, and serious adverse events only for the 10 WHO\u2010approved vaccines. For remaining outcomes and vaccines, see main text. The evidence for mortality was generally sparse and of low or very low certainty for all WHO\u2010approved vaccines, except AD26.COV2.S (Janssen), which probably reduces the risk of all\u2010cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.25, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.67; 1 RCT, 43,783 participants; high\u2010certainty evidence). Confirmed symptomatic COVID\u201019 High\u2010certainty evidence found that BNT162b2 (BioNtech/Fosun Pharma/Pfizer), mRNA\u20101273 (ModernaTx), ChAdOx1 (Oxford/AstraZeneca), Ad26.COV2.S, BBIBP\u2010CorV (Sinopharm\u2010Beijing), and BBV152 (Bharat Biotect) reduce the incidence of symptomatic COVID\u201019 compared to placebo (vaccine efficacy (VE): BNT162b2: 97.84%, 95% CI 44.25% to 99.92%; 2 RCTs, 44,077 participants; mRNA\u20101273: 93.20%, 95% CI 91.06% to 94.83%; 2 RCTs, 31,632 participants; ChAdOx1: 70.23%, 95% CI 62.10% to 76.62%; 2 RCTs, 43,390 participants; Ad26.COV2.S: 66.90%, 95% CI 59.10% to 73.40%; 1 RCT, 39,058 participants; BBIBP\u2010CorV: 78.10%, 95% CI 64.80% to 86.30%; 1 RCT, 25,463 participants; BBV152: 77.80%, 95% CI 65.20% to 86.40%; 1 RCT, 16,973 participants). Moderate\u2010certainty evidence found that NVX\u2010CoV2373 (Novavax) probably reduces the incidence of symptomatic COVID\u201019 compared to placebo (VE 82.91%, 95% CI 50.49% to 94.10%; 3 RCTs, 42,175 participants). There is low\u2010certainty evidence for CoronaVac (Sinovac) for this outcome (VE 69.81%, 95% CI 12.27% to 89.61%; 2 RCTs, 19,852 participants). Severe or critical COVID\u201019 High\u2010certainty evidence found that BNT162b2, mRNA\u20101273, Ad26.COV2.S, and BBV152 result in a large reduction in incidence of severe or critical disease due to COVID\u201019 compared to placebo (VE: BNT162b2: 95.70%, 95% CI 73.90% to 99.90%; 1 RCT, 46,077 participants; mRNA\u20101273: 98.20%, 95% CI 92.80% to 99.60%; 1 RCT, 28,451 participants; AD26.COV2.S: 76.30%, 95% CI 57.90% to 87.50%; 1 RCT, 39,058 participants; BBV152: 93.40%, 95% CI 57.10% to 99.80%; 1 RCT, 16,976 participants). Moderate\u2010certainty evidence found that NVX\u2010CoV2373 probably reduces the incidence of severe or critical COVID\u201019 (VE 100.00%, 95% CI 86.99% to 100.00%; 1 RCT, 25,452 participants). Two trials reported high efficacy of CoronaVac for severe or critical disease with wide CIs, but these results could not be pooled. Serious adverse events (SAEs) mRNA\u20101273, ChAdOx1 (Oxford\u2010AstraZeneca)/SII\u2010ChAdOx1 (Serum Institute of India), Ad26.COV2.S, and BBV152 probably result in little or no difference in SAEs compared to placebo (RR: mRNA\u20101273: 0.92, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.08; 2 RCTs, 34,072 participants; ChAdOx1/SII\u2010ChAdOx1: 0.88, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.07; 7 RCTs, 58,182 participants; Ad26.COV2.S: 0.92, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.22; 1 RCT, 43,783 participants); BBV152: 0.65, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.97; 1 RCT, 25,928 participants). In each of these, the likely absolute difference in effects was fewer than 5/1000 participants. Evidence for SAEs is uncertain for BNT162b2, CoronaVac, BBIBP\u2010CorV, and NVX\u2010CoV2373 compared to placebo (RR: BNT162b2: 1.30, 95% CI 0.55 to 3.07; 2 RCTs, 46,107 participants; CoronaVac: 0.97, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.51; 4 RCTs, 23,139 participants; BBIBP\u2010CorV: 0.76, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.06; 1 RCT, 26,924 participants; NVX\u2010CoV2373: 0.92, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.14; 4 RCTs, 38,802 participants). For the evaluation of heterologous schedules, booster doses, and efficacy against variants of concern, see main text of review. Authors' conclusions Compared to placebo, most vaccines reduce, or likely reduce, the proportion of participants with confirmed symptomatic COVID\u201019, and for some, there is high\u2010certainty evidence that they reduce severe or critical disease. There is probably little or no difference between most vaccines and placebo for serious adverse events. Over 300 registered RCTs are evaluating the efficacy of COVID\u201019 vaccines, and this review is updated regularly on the COVID\u2010NMA platform (covid-nma.com). Implications for practice Due to the trial exclusions, these results cannot be generalized to pregnant women, individuals with a history of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection, or immunocompromized people. Most trials had a short follow\u2010up and were conducted before the emergence of variants of concern. Implications for research Future research should evaluate the long\u2010term effect of vaccines, compare different vaccines and vaccine schedules, assess vaccine efficacy and safety in specific populations, and include outcomes such as preventing long COVID\u201019.

Despite the safety and efficacy of vaccines, acceptance is not universal, and understanding of the factors influencing vaccination decisions and hesitancy remains limited. This review aims to identify and analyze studies addressing two key questions: what influences the decision to vaccinate and what factors are associated with vaccine hesitancy. Methods: This systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines. Data collection utilized descriptors related to vaccine adherence and hesitancy, based on the PEO strategy of the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI). Searches were conducted in Embase, Scopus, PubMed, Lilacs, and Web of Science, focusing on publications from 2021, the year the first COVID-19 vaccine was approved. After excluding duplicates and selecting articles based on eligibility criteria, the analysis involved data extraction and methodological quality assessment using JBI tools. Results: A total of 5268 publications were identified, with 30 included in this study. Factors associated with vaccine hesitancy included low education levels, social media influence, confidence in vaccine safety, and fear of side effects. In contrast, factors linked to vaccine acceptance included higher education, higher income, older age, and existing comorbidities.

NFE2L2/NRF2 knockout cells have low HERC2 expression, leading to a simultaneous increase in ferritin and NCOA4 and recruitment of apoferritin into the autophagosome. NFE2L2/NRF2 knockout cells also have low VAMP8 expression, which leads to ferritinophagy blockage. Therefore, deletion of NFE2L2/NRF2 results in apoferritin accumulation in the autophagosome, an elevated LIP, and enhanced sensitivity to ferroptosis. Concordantly, NRF2 levels correlate with HERC2 and VAMP8 in human ovarian cancer tissues, as well as ferroptosis resistance in a panel of ovarian cancer cell lines.

Methods: The dataset of gene expression profiling for PAH (GSE113439) was downloaded from the gene expression omnibus (GEO) database. Isorhamnetin target genes were extracted from the comparative toxicogenomics database (CTD). Various bioinformatics methods were employed to identify the core pathways associated with PAH and potential intervention targets. Molecular docking was conducted between the interacting target and the candidate compound, isorhamnetin. Results: One thousand nine hundred sixty-two upregulated genes and 642 downregulated genes were identified. Molecular complex detection analyses revealed that the significant biological processes associated with upregulated genes included DNA damage response, mitotic cell cycle, and chromosome organization. In contrast, the significant biological processes related to downregulated genes encompassed cellular response to growth factor stimulus, response to growth factor, and blood vessel development. Immune infiltration analysis indicated that PAH is associated with significant changes in the distribution of immune cells and differential expression of immune checkpoints. Furthermore, 58 isorhamnetin targets were extracted from the CTD, and we identified 1 interacting gene, NFE2L2, among the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), DEGs related to ferroptosis, and isorhamnetin targets. Isorhamnetin demonstrated strong affinities with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors and transcription factors (ATM and ZNF24) associated with VEGFs, as well as the ferroptosis protein NFE2L2. Conclusions: Pulmonary arterial hypertension is characterized by a series of abnormalities in downstream molecular signaling pathways, including DNA damage, immune dysregulation, VEGF signaling deficiency, and the ferroptosis process. These may represent the core pathophysiological mechanisms of PAH. Ferroptosis-related genes, such as NFE2L2 and TF (ATM, ZNF24) associated with VEGFs, are potential therapeutic targets that contribute to the mechanisms mentioned above.

Relaxin\u20102, a well\u2010known hormone involved in metabolic regulation across various tissues and cells, has not been extensively studied in the context of chondrocyte dysfunction and OA. T/C\u201028a2 cells were stimulated with tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u2010\u03b1) (10\u2009ng/mL) with or without recombinant human relaxin\u20102 (rh relaxin\u20102) (25, 50\u2009nM) for 48\u2009h. Various techniques, including 2\u2032,7\u2032\u2010dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH\u2010DA) staining, real\u2010time PCR, western blot analysis, enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and luciferase activity assays, were employed. We discovered that exposure to TNF\u2010\u03b1 decreased the expression of Relaxin\u20102 at both the mRNA and protein levels. Further investigation revealed that treatment with rh relaxin\u20102 mitigated lipid peroxidation by reducing levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), and 4\u2010hydroxy\u20102\u2010nonenal (4\u2010HNE), while increasing superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and glutathione (GSH) content. Notably, rh relaxin\u20102 restored iron metabolism balance disrupted by TNF\u2010\u03b1 in human T/C\u201028a2 chondrocytes by decreasing Fe2+ levels, downregulating transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1) gene expression, and upregulating ferritin gene expression. Additionally, rh relaxin\u20102 alleviated ferroptosis induced by TNF\u2010\u03b1 in these cells by increasing glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) expression, decreasing acyl\u2010CoA synthetase long\u2010chain family member 4 (ACSL4) expression, and reducing lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. Rh relaxin\u20102 also inhibited the TNF\u2010\u03b1\u2010induced expression of pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines, interleukin\u20101\u03b2 (IL\u20101\u03b2) and interleukin\u20106 (IL\u20106). Interestingly, rh relaxin\u20102 attenuated TNF\u2010\u03b1\u2010induced chondrocyte degeneration by suppressing matrix metalloproteinase\u201013 (MMP\u201013) expression and preventing degradation of collagen type II alpha1 chain (Col2\u03b1). Mechanistically, these effects of rh relaxin\u20102 were found to be mediated through the nuclear factor erythroid 2\u2010related factor 2 (Nrf2)/NF\u2010\u03baB signaling pathway.

A modified Delphi methodology was used to arrive at a consensus consisting of several focus groups, multiple rounds, and an anonymous survey. The field of endocrinology has seen many new advances for the treatment of T1DM including hybrid closed-loop insulin delivery systems and continuous glucose monitors for better glycaemic control, monoclonal antibodies to delay the onset of disease and increased access to paediatric endocrinologists, among many other noteworthy achievements. Despite these advancements, standard of care approaches to T1DM result in higher than acceptable morbidity and mortality, with a high prevalence of microvascular and macrovascular complications. Insulin resistance in type 1 diabetes is an independent risk factor for adverse outcomes even in well controlled type 1 diabetes.

Methods This was a cross-sectional study including 264 older adults with T2DM in Shanghai, China. Chinese version of Problem Areas in Diabetes Scale (PAID-C), Patient Assessment of Chronic Illness Care (PACIC) and Diabetes Self-Management Behaviour for Older (DSMB-O) were employed. Student\u2019s t-test, one-way ANOVA or the nonparametric analysis (Mann\u2013Whitney U-test), Pearson correlation coefficient and structural equation model (SEM) were used to analyse the data. Results A total of 264 participants (157 males [59.47%], with an average age of 71.07\u00b16.47 years) were included in the study; their duration of T2DM ranged from 5 to 30 years, with a mean duration of 11.19\u00b16.96 years. The DSMB-O scores exhibited a negative correlation with the PAID-C scores (r=\u22120.250, p<0.01), while showing a positive correlation with PACIC scores (r=0.348, p<0.01). Additionally, PAID-C scores demonstrated a negative correlation with PACIC scores (r=\u22120.182, p<0.01). The indirect effect of PAID-C on DSMB-O through PACIC was calculated as (\u22120.70*-0.39=0.27). Furthermore, the total effect of PAID-C on DSMB-O via PACIC was determined to be (0.27+0.22=0.49). Notably, the mediating effect accounted for 54.99%.

Objectives: This study examined the energy needs and LEA prevalence, with or without eating disorder (ED) risk, among HBCU female student-athletes. Methods: Twenty-seven female student-athletes (age = 19 \u00b1 1 year; height = 166.9 \u00b1 7.6 cm; weight = 68.8 \u00b1 11.3 kg) completed baseline measures, including the Eating Disorder Inventory-3 (EDI-3), EDI-3 symptom checklist (EDI-SC), anthropometric measures, and resting metabolic rate (RMR).

Known for their psychoactive effects through serotonin receptors (5-HTRs), N-dimethylated tryptamines are currently being reinvestigated clinically for their long-term benefits in mental disorders. Endogenous tryptamine is methylated by indolethylamine-N-methyltransferase (INMT), which can then serve as an agonist to pro-survival pathways, such as sigma non-opioid intracellular receptor 1 (SIGMAR1) signaling. Fibrogenic diseases, like metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), steatohepatitis (MASH), and chronic kidney disease (CKD) have shown changes in INMT and SIGMAR1 activity in the progression of disease pathogenesis. At the cellular level, endothelial cells and fibroblasts have been found to express INMT in various tissues; however, little is known about tryptamines in endothelial injury and fibrosis. In this review, I will give an overview of the biochemistry, molecular biology, and current evidence of INMT\u2019s role in hepatic fibrogenesis.

The crisis showed that job characteristics alone are insufficient to explain employee health and motivation, i.e., the two focal outcomes of the JD-R theory. Rather, demands and resources of the individual, the family, the job and the organization interact with each other to predict outcomes. Moreover, next to individual regulatory strategies also the regulatory strategies of the family, the leader and organization/team are suggested to modify the impact of demands and resources on outcomes. This was possible by integrating the crisis management literature in JD-R theory. Viewing the crisis from a job design perspective helped us to introduce several new and testable propositions that specify how employee well-being and functioning are impacted by crises and turbulent times. Plain Language Summary Organizations have been struggling to find out how their employees are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and what they can do to support their well-being and improve their functioning during the pandemic and beyond. The well-being and job performance of individual employees are difficult to predict which becomes even more complicated during times of crisis. The Job Demands\u2013Resources theory is a helpful means because it suggests that employee health and motivation are outcomes of two different processes, i.e., the health impairment process and the motivational process. Job demands, such as work pressure and demanding customers, exhaust the energy of employees and consequently diminish their health, whereas job resources, such as autonomy and social support, help employees to deal with the demands and to develop themselves. The pandemic showed that the interplay between demands and resources of the individual, the job, the family and the organization predict outcomes. Moreover, next to individual regulatory strategies also the regulatory strategies of the family, the leader and organization/team are suggested to modify the impact of demands and resources on outcomes.

Pulmonary hypertension is a disease with a poor prognosis and an average life expectancy of 2\u20133 years that leads to vascular remodeling of the pulmonary arteries; the pulmonary arteries are essential to host homeostasis, as they divert deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle of the heart to the lungs for gas exchange. This review focuses on direct links between the complement system\u2019s involvement in pulmonary hypertension, along with autoimmune conditions, and the reliance on the complement system for vascular remodeling processes of the pulmonary artery. Furthermore, circadian rhythmicity is highlighted as the disrupted homeostatic mechanism in the inflammatory consequences in the vascular remodeling within the pulmonary arteries, which could potentially open new therapeutic cues. The current treatment options for pulmonary hypertension are discussed with clinical trials using complement inhibitors and potential therapeutic targets that impact immune cell functions and complement activation, which could alleviate symptoms and block the progression of the disease. Further research on complement\u2019s involvement in interstitial lung diseases and pulmonary hypertension could prove beneficial for our understanding of these various diseases and potential treatment options to prevent vascular remodeling of the pulmonary arteries.", "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-11-28", "synthetic_support_claim": "The complement system is directly involved in pulmonary hypertension and vascular remodeling of the pulmonary artery.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Circadian rhythms regulate the complement system's involvement in inflammation beyond pulmonary hypertension."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "7c98e2750ad02013429d1a17754c662b1628cc22", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7c98e2750ad02013429d1a17754c662b1628cc22", "title": "Depression in Pulmonary Hypertension: A Systematic Review of Clinical Outcomes, Treatment Interactions, and Emerging Technologies", "abstract": "Background: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is characterized by elevated pulmonary artery pressure, often leading to right heart failure and poor prognosis. Depression, a common comorbidity in PH, significantly affects the quality of life. However, mechanistic insights into the bidirectional relationship between PH and depression and specific treatment interactions remain scarce. Objective: The object was to examine the clinical and therapeutic implications of depression in PH, focusing on its impact on patient outcomes and cost efficiency. Methods: A systematic review of Medline and Google Scholar was conducted to identify studies on depression in PH, emphasizing evidence-based interventions, clinical outcomes, and cost efficiency. Special consideration was given to potential drug interactions between PH medications and depression treatments and to the role of emerging technologies in managing PH-related depression. Results: While depression reduces the quality of life and exacerbates disease severity in PH, depression treatment improves outcomes, particularly when tailored to PH-targeted therapies, considering potential drug\u2013drug interactions. Emerging technologies, including telemedicine, offer innovative approaches to manage depression in PH, enhancing access to care and improving adherence to treatment regimens. Conclusions: Depression in PH must no longer be neglected and should be acknowledged as both a critical comorbidity and a significant driver of disease progression.

During 2016, an estimated 50 million adults in the United States experienced chronic pain, resulting in substantial health care costs and lost productivity (5,6). Addressing chronic pain and improving the lives of persons living with pain is a public health imperative.

Methods A library of 640 natural products was screened for anti-proliferative activity in SCLC cells. The effects of Cepharanthine (CE) on SCLC cells were assessed in vitro and in vivo. Network pharmacology and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) were used to elucidate the molecular mechanisms. Pathway enrichment analysis was performed using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) with Hallmark and Reactome gene sets. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, along with the Cytoscape cytoHubba plugin, were used to identify key hub genes. RT-PCR and Western blotting were employed to validate mRNA and protein expression. Molecular docking studies assessed the binding affinity of CE to potential targets. Bioinformatics analyses, including expression profiling, prognostic evaluation, and loss-of-function studies, were used to explore the role of specific genes in SCLC. Results CE was identified as a promising SCLC inhibitor. In vitro, CE significantly inhibited SCLC cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion, while promoting apoptosis. In vivo, CE treatment notably reduced tumor volume in xenograft models. Network pharmacology identified 60 potential target genes, with enrichment analysis indicating their involvement in cholesterol metabolism regulation. RNA-seq and experimental validation further confirmed that CE inhibits cholesterol synthesis in SCLC cells by downregulating key enzymes, including HMGCR, HMGCS1, IDI1, FDFT1, and SQLE. Molecular docking studies confirmed the binding of CE to these enzymes. Additionally, these enzymes were found to be highly expressed in SCLC cells, with elevated levels of HMGCS1, HMGCR, and IDI1 correlating with poor prognosis.

A total of eight members of the GPX family are currently found, namely GPX1-GPX8. They have long been used as antioxidant enzymes to play an important role in combating oxidative stress and maintaining redox balance. However, each member of the GPX family has a different mechanism of action and site of action in maintaining redox balance. GPX1-4 and GPX6 use selenocysteine as the active center to catalyze the reduction of H2O2 or organic hydroperoxides to water or corresponding alcohols, thereby reducing their toxicity and maintaining redox balance. In addition to reducing H2O2 and small molecule hydroperoxides, GPX4 is also capable of reducing complex lipid compounds. It is the only enzyme in the GPX family that directly reduces and destroys lipid hydroperoxides. The active sites of GPX5 and GPX7-GPX8 do not contain selenium cysteine (Secys), but instead, have cysteine residues (Cys) as their active sites. GPX5 is mainly expressed in epididymal tissue and plays a role in protecting sperm from oxidative stress.

Consistent with previous reports, the Hyper fluid\u2010attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) rim sign exhibited higher sensitivity in lower\u2010grade gliomas for IDH mutant gliomas compared with the T2\u2010FLAIR mismatch sign. However, the Hyper FLAIR rim sign was also present in Grade 4 gliomas, and thus, the T2\u2010FLAIR mismatch sign exhibited better clinical efficacy in predicting glioma grade and IDH mutation compared with the Hyper FLAIR rim sign in clinical applications. Meanwhile, preoperative magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) indicators, particularly the Cho/Cr ratio, have shown excellent performance in predicting glioma grade and IDH mutation status. The nomogram developed through stepwise regression demonstrated excellent predictive capabilities in distinguishing glioma grade and IDH mutation status.

For such patients, symptoms related to the tumor and associated treatment contribute to morbidity and erode quality of life. With improved treatment, a better understanding of these effects over time is critically needed. Existing data characterizing unmet needs of lower-grade glioma patients is limited and little consensus exists on addressing these needs in clinical practice.\n\n\nMethods\nIn order to better identify and address the unmet needs of lower-grade glioma patients, focus groups among patients and caregivers were initially conducted among patients treated at a single academic center. A semi-structured interview guide to comprehensively understand unmet needs was then developed. Each patient-defined unmet need was categorized into domains through qualitative content analysis. In parallel, a database of established local and regional community-based resources was established, and a dedicated resource specialist provided patient-specific referrals and follow-up.\n\n\nResults\nEighty-five patients were interviewed. Median age was 41 years and the median time from tumor diagnosis was 63 months. Approximately 68% had a WHO grade 2 tumor and 60% were off therapy. Qualitative analysis of interview content identified 5 overarching domains of unmet need: Psychosocial; Neurologic/Cognitive; Lifestyle; Financial; and Other Medical. At least one unmet need was identified by 71% of participants and the most common domains were Psychosocial (40.7%) and Lifestyle (34.9%).\n\n\nConclusions\nOur program begins to address frequently unmet survivorship needs of lower-grade glioma patients that spanned 5 major domains.

In most cases, adrenal incidentalomas are non-functioning adrenocortical adenomas, but may also require therapeutic intervention including that for adrenocortical carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, hormone-producing adenoma or metastases. Here, we provide a revision of the first international, interdisciplinary guidelines on incidentalomas. We followed the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system and updated systematic reviews on four predefined clinical questions crucial for the management of incidentalomas: A) How to assess risk of malignancy? ; B) How to define and manage mild autonomous cortisol secretion? ; C) Who should have surgical treatment and how should it be performed? ; D) What follow-up is indicated if the adrenal incidentaloma is not surgically removed? Selected Recommendations: 1) Each adrenal mass requires dedicated adrenal imaging. Recent advances now allow discrimination between risk categories: Homogeneous lesions with HU\u2009\u2264\u200910 on unenhanced CT are benign and do not require any additional imaging independent of size. All other patients should be discussed in a multidisciplinary expert meeting, but only lesions >4\u2005cm that are inhomogeneous or have HU >20 have sufficiently high risk of malignancy that surgery will be the usual management of choice. 2) Every patient needs a thorough clinical and endocrine work-up to exclude hormone excess including the measurement of plasma or urinary metanephrines and a 1-mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test (applying a cutoff value of serum cortisol \u226450\u2005nmol/l (\u22641.8\u2005\u00b5g/dl)). Recent studies have provided evidence that most patients without clinical signs of overt Cushing's syndrome but serum cortisol levels post dexamethasone >50\u2005nmol/l (>1.8\u2005\u00b5g/dl) harbor increased risk of morbidity and mortality. For this condition, we propose the term 'mild autonomous cortisol secretion' (MACS). 3) All patients with MACS should be screened for potential cortisol-related comorbidities that are potentially attributably to cortisol (e.g. hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus), to ensure these are appropriately treated. 4) In patients with MACS who also have relevant comorbidities surgical treatment should be considered in an individualized approach. 5) The appropriateness of surgical intervention should be guided by the likelihood of malignancy, the presence and degree of hormone excess, age, general health and patient preference. We provide guidance on which surgical approach should be considered for adrenal masses with radiological findings suspicious of malignancy. 6) Surgery is not usually indicated in patients with an asymptomatic, non-functioning unilateral adrenal mass and obvious benign features on imaging studies. Furthermore, we offer recommendations for the follow-up of non-operated patients, management of patients with bilateral incidentalomas, for patients with extra-adrenal malignancy and adrenal masses, and for young and elderly patients with adrenal incidentalomas.

Liquid biopsy emerges as a promising non-invasive technique for distinguishing between malignant and benign, as well as hyperfunctioning and non-functioning cases. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of microRNAs as circulating biomarkers; however, their clinical utility remains underexplored. This study aims to validate the diagnostic performance of selected circulating microRNAs, (miR-483-5p, miR-210, miR-335 and miR-22-3p), identified through microRNA profiling studies, as markers of malignancy or cortisol hypersecretion in a cohort of patients with ATs. Methods We collected serum samples from 75 patients with ATs, including 50 cases of adrenocortical adenomas (ACA) and 25 cases of adrenocortical carcinomas (ACC), along with 15 controls. In the ACC subgroup, 16 samples were obtained preoperatively or upon detection of recurrence (active ACC group), while the remaining from disease-free patients with long-term follow-up. Among the 56 patients with ATs evaluated preoperatively (50 with ACAs and 6 with ACC), 26 had non-functioning tumors, 22 exhibited mild autonomous cortisol secretion, and 8 had Cushing syndrome. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was employed to analyze microRNA expression. Results Circulating levels of miR-483-5p and miR-210 were significantly elevated in patients with active ACC compared to both ACAs (p<0.001 and p=0.004, respectively) and controls (p=0.02 and p = 0.03, respectively). Notably, miR-483-5p serum levels were higher in patients with active ACC compared to disease-free ACC patients (p = 0.01). MiR-483-5p demonstrated the best diagnostic accuracy for distinguishing active ACC cases from ACAs, achieving a sensitivity of 81.3% and a specificity of 88%, and from disease-free ACC patients, reaching sensitivity of 81.3% and specificity of 89%. MiR-22-3p serum levels successfully differentiated patients with Cushing syndrome from those with non-functioning ATs (area under the curve=AUC=0.800, 95% CI: 0.653\u20130.953, p=0.01) and controls (AUC= 0.800, 95% CI: 0.610\u20130.990, p=0.02). Additionally, circulating miR-22-3p levels exhibited a significant correlation with traditional diagnostic tests for hypercortisolism.

Summary Answer International evidence-based guidelines address prioritized questions and outcomes and include 254 recommendations and practice points, to promote consistent, evidence-based care and improve the experience and health outcomes in PCOS. What is Known Already The 2018 International PCOS Guideline was independently evaluated as high quality and integrated multidisciplinary and consumer perspectives from six continents; it is now used in 196 countries and is widely cited. It was based on best available, but generally very low to low quality, evidence. It applied robust methodological processes and addressed shared priorities. The guideline transitioned from consensus based to evidence-based diagnostic criteria and enhanced accuracy of diagnosis, whilst promoting consistency of care. However, diagnosis is still delayed, the needs of those with PCOS are not being adequately met, evidence quality was low and evidence-practice gaps persist. Study Design, Size, Duration The 2023 International Evidence-based Guideline update reengaged the 2018 network across professional societies and consumer organizations with multidisciplinary experts and women with PCOS directly involved at all stages. Extensive evidence synthesis was completed. Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation-II (AGREEII)-compliant processes were followed. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework was applied across evidence quality, feasibility, acceptability, cost, implementation and ultimately recommendation strength and diversity and inclusion were considered throughout. Participants/Materials, Setting, Methods This summary should be read in conjunction with the full Guideline for detailed participants and methods. Governance included a six-continent international advisory and management committee, five guideline development groups, and paediatric, consumer, and translation committees. Extensive consumer engagement and guideline experts informed the update scope and priorities. Engaged international society-nominated panels included paediatrics, endocrinology, gynaecology, primary care, reproductive endocrinology, obstetrics, psychiatry, psychology, dietetics, exercise physiology, obesity care, public health and other experts, alongside consumers, project management, evidence synthesis, statisticians and translation experts. Thirty-nine professional and consumer organizations covering 71 countries engaged in the process. Twenty meetings and five face-to-face forums over 12 months addressed 58 prioritized clinical questions involving 52 systematic and 3 narrative reviews. Evidence-based recommendations were developed and approved via consensus across five guideline panels, modified based on international feedback and peer review, independently reviewed for methodological rigour, and approved by the Australian Government National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC). Main Results and the Role of Chance The evidence in the assessment and management of PCOS has generally improved in the past five years, but remains of low to moderate quality. The technical evidence report and analyses (\u223c6000 pages) underpins 77 evidence-based and 54 consensus recommendations, with 123 practice points. Key updates include: i) further refinement of individual diagnostic criteria, a simplified diagnostic algorithm and inclusion of anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH) levels as an alternative to ultrasound in adults only; ii) strengthening recognition of broader features of PCOS including metabolic risk factors, cardiovascular disease, sleep apnea, very high prevalence of psychological features, and high risk status for adverse outcomes during pregnancy; iii) emphasizing the poorly recognized, diverse burden of disease and the need for greater healthcare professional education, evidence-based patient information, improved models of care and shared decision making to improve patient experience, alongside greater research; iv) maintained emphasis on healthy lifestyle, emotional wellbeing and quality of life, with awareness and consideration of weight stigma; and v) emphasizing evidence-based medical therapy and cheaper and safer fertility management. Limitations, Reasons for Caution Overall, recommendations are strengthened and evidence is improved, but remain generally low to moderate quality. Significantly greater research is now needed in this neglected, yet common condition. Regional health system variation was considered and acknowledged, with a further process for guideline and translation resource adaptation provided. Wider Implications of the Findings The 2023 International Guideline for the Assessment and Management of PCOS provides clinicians and patients with clear advice on best practice, based on the best available evidence, expert multidisciplinary input and consumer preferences. Research recommendations have been generated and a comprehensive multifaceted dissemination and translation programme supports the Guideline with an integrated evaluation program.

and Health Care Experience in Those With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome", "abstract": "Purpose Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a complex endocrine-metabolic disorder and is associated with a variety of health disorders. The management of PCOS requires a multidisciplinary health care approach. The COVID-19 pandemic affected access and delivery of health care. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of the pandemic on the health and health care experience of those affected by PCOS. Patients and Methods An online survey was conducted January 2021 to July 2022 in Canada, open to anyone who identified as having PCOS. Data collected in REDCap included questions on demographics, symptoms, and experience of PCOS management during the pandemic. Results The majority (59%) of respondents (n=194, mean age 34\u00b18 years) experienced pandemic-related employment changes and self-reported a high stress level (73\u00b121/100). Of those who reported changes in body weight, 58% gained weight, which they attributed to unhealthy eating habits and a lack of exercise during the pandemic, and 16% lost weight, which they credited to increased physical activity and a shift towards healthier eating habits. The respondents ascribed the impact of COVID-related changes to clinic cancellations, delayed appointments, long wait times for referrals and lab work, lack of access to exercise facilities and insufficient social support. Some respondents voluntarily reduced access to health care services to limit COVID exposure. COVID-19-related health status was perceived as more important than their own PCOS-related symptoms. Virtual appointments via telehealth were regarded as beneficial for 20% of users. Conclusion Individuals with PCOS reported an overall reduction in COVID-related access to health care and supports. Some adapted to the use of telemedicine, while others experienced increased stress due to a lack of access to health care and an inability to manage their PCOS symptoms. The pandemic further highlighted that those with PCOS often experience a lack of accessibility to multidisciplinary health care and supports needed to manage their condition.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-01", "synthetic_support_claim": "Individuals with PCOS reported increased stress and reduced access to health care during the pandemic.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "PCOS patients experienced a significant improvement in symptoms due to pandemic-induced lifestyle changes and stress reduction."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "48a447bc981eec3d3cc6068474951313d42b9fbb", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/48a447bc981eec3d3cc6068474951313d42b9fbb", "title": "Futibatinib for FGFR2-Rearranged Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nAlterations in fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) have emerged as promising drug targets for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, a rare cancer with a poor prognosis. Futibatinib, a next-generation, covalently binding FGFR1-4 inhibitor, has been shown to have both antitumor activity in patients with FGFR-altered tumors and strong preclinical activity against acquired resistance mutations associated with ATP-competitive FGFR inhibitors.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn this multinational, open-label, single-group, phase 2 study, we enrolled patients with unresectable or metastatic FGFR2 fusion-positive or FGFR2 rearrangement-positive intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and disease progression after one or more previous lines of systemic therapy (excluding FGFR inhibitors). The patients received oral futibatinib at a dose of 20 mg once daily in a continuous regimen. The primary end point was objective response (partial or complete response), as assessed by independent central review. Secondary end points included the response duration, progression-free and overall survival, safety, and patient-reported outcomes.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBetween April 16, 2018, and November 29, 2019, a total of 103 patients were enrolled and received futibatinib. A total of 43 of 103 patients (42%; 95% confidence interval, 32 to 52) had a response, and the median duration of response was 9.7 months. Responses were consistent across patient subgroups, including patients with heavily pretreated disease, older adults, and patients who had co-occurring TP53 mutations. At a median follow-up of 17.1 months, the median progression-free survival was 9.0 months and overall survival was 21.7 months. Common treatment-related grade 3 adverse events were hyperphosphatemia (in 30% of the patients), an increased aspartate aminotransferase level (in 7%), stomatitis (in 6%), and fatigue (in 6%). Treatment-related adverse events led to permanent discontinuation of futibatinib in 2% of the patients. No treatment-related deaths occurred. Quality of life was maintained throughout treatment.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn previously treated patients with FGFR2 fusion or rearrangement-positive intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, the use of futibatinib, a covalent FGFR inhibitor, led to measurable clinical benefit.

In 2016, the European Commission mandated EFSA to re\u2010evaluate the risks to public health from the presence of BPA in foodstuffs and to establish a tolerable daily intake (TDI). For this re\u2010evaluation, a pre\u2010established protocol was used that had undergone public consultation. The CEP Panel concluded that it is Unlikely to Very Unlikely that BPA presents a genotoxic hazard through a direct mechanism. Taking into consideration the evidence from animal data and support from human observational studies, the immune system was identified as most sensitive to BPA exposure. An effect on Th17 cells in mice was identified as the critical effect; these cells are pivotal in cellular immune mechanisms and involved in the development of inflammatory conditions, including autoimmunity and lung inflammation. A reference point (RP) of 8.2 ng/kg bw per day, expressed as human equivalent dose, was identified for the critical effect. Uncertainty analysis assessed a probability of 57\u201373% that the lowest estimated Benchmark Dose (BMD) for other health effects was below the RP based on Th17 cells. In view of this, the CEP Panel judged that an additional uncertainty factor (UF) of 2 was needed for establishing the TDI. Applying an overall UF of 50 to the RP, a TDI of 0.2 ng BPA/kg bw per day was established. Comparison of this TDI with the dietary exposure estimates from the 2015 EFSA opinion showed that both the mean and the 95th percentile dietary exposures in all age groups exceeded the TDI by two to three orders of magnitude.

Despite its widespread usage, the effects of BPA on the risk and development of metabolic syndrome are not fully understood. Prenatal exposure to BPA has been shown to disrupt the development of offspring's metabolically active tissues and increase their susceptibility to the adverse consequences of a trans-fat diet (TFD).\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn this experiment, pregnant rats (n\u2009=\u200918) were randomly separated into three groups. These groups were treated from pregnancy day (PD) 2 to PD 21. Subsequently, the male offspring of these rats were provided either a normal-diet (ND) or a TFD from 3rd postnatal week (PNW) to 14th PNW. Then, protein expression of PPAR-\u03b3 and global DNA methylation were assessed in the adult rat offspring that were exposed to in utero BPA and subjected to postnatal TFD intake.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe study findings have shown that there was no association between prenatal exposure to BPA and/or TFD consumption and PPAR-\u03b3 protein expression within all the study groups in the liver tissue.

This study examines the indications and outcomes of microaxial flow pumps (Impella\u00ae, Abiomed Inc., Danvers, MA, USA) when cannulated through the axillary artery in patients with severe CS, with a particular focus on acute phase reactions and hemolytic responses. Materials and Methods: This single-center, retrospective cohort involved patients who received microaxial Impella implantation via the axillary artery from 2020 to 2022 (n = 47). Results: Among the patients, 66% (N = 31 cases) were treated with the Impella 5.5, 25.5% (N = 12 cases) with the Impella 5.0, and 8.5% (N = 4 cases) with the Impella CP. Additionally, 28% were managed using the ECMELLA concept. The mean length of time for Impella support was 8 days. The overall 30-day survival rate was 78%, with no significant differences observed between the ECMELLA group and the various Impella types. At 30 days post-therapy, 47% of survivors no longer required mechanical support, while 26% were upgraded to a durable LVAD. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were significantly lower in patients receiving Impella 5.5 (n = 17 vs. 12) immediately following implantation (p = 0.03) compared with those with smaller devices. Haptoglobin levels were significantly higher in the Impella 5.5 group (n = 17 vs. 11, p = 0.02), with overall lower rates of hemolysis (45.1%, p < 0.01). Conclusions: The mortality rate in critical CS appears reduced with axillary artery implantation of Impella devices relative to existing literature. A full-flow microaxial pump (Impella 5.5) seems advantageous regarding systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and acute hemolysis, indicated by lower IL-6 and higher haptoglobin levels, compared with smaller Impella devices.

Mechanical circulatory support devices, particularly venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO), are increasingly being utilized to address this issue. Limited randomized controlled trials (RCTs) exist to evaluate the efficacy of VA-ECMO in cardiogenic shock related to acute coronary syndrome. Methods: A meta-analysis was conducted to assess the effectiveness of VA-ECMO in adult patients with infarct-related cardiogenic shock. Trials were identified through database searches and selected based on specific inclusion criteria. The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality, with secondary outcomes including bleeding and vascular complications. Results: A total of 24 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis, involving 4706 patients. The median age of the patients was 61.8 \u00b1 4.1 years, with 76% of them being males. The analysis revealed that 30-day mortality rates for patients with cardiogenic shock receiving ECMO were still high, with a mortality of 63%.

Activation of 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) 2A receptors (5-HT2ARs) is essential for psychedelic-induced cortical plasticity, but it is currently unclear why some 5-HT2AR agonists promote neuroplasticity, whereas others do not. We used molecular and genetic tools to demonstrate that intracellular 5-HT2ARs mediate the plasticity-promoting properties of psychedelics; these results explain why serotonin does not engage similar plasticity mechanisms. This work emphasizes the role of location bias in 5-HT2AR signaling, identifies intracellular 5-HT2ARs as a therapeutic target, and raises the intriguing possibility that serotonin might not be the endogenous ligand for intracellular 5-HT2ARs in the cortex.

However, the mechanisms by which receptor activation leads to changes in neuronal growth are still poorly defined.

However, little is known about how 5-HT influences the claustrum. We have combined whole-cell patch-clamp measurements of ionic currents, flash photolysis, and receptor pharmacology to characterize the 5-HT responses of individual claustral projection neurons (PNs) in mouse brain slices. Serotonin application elicited a long-lasting outward current in claustral PNs. This current was due to an increase in membrane permeability to K+ ions and was mediated mainly by the type 1A 5-HT receptor (5-HTR-1A). The 5-HT-induced K+ current hyperpolarized, and thereby inhibited, the PNs by reducing action potential firing. Focal uncaging of 5-HT revealed that inhibitory 5-HTR-1As were located at both the soma and dendrites of PNs.

Nevertheless, progression is observed in a substantial subgroup of patients following an initial objective response to treatment with TILs. These patients might benefit from additional consolidating treatment before clinical progression, but thus far, it is not possible to identify this subgroup of patients prone to progress. In this study the predictive value of early metabolic response after TIL therapy is explored. Materials and methods: 60 patients treated with TIL therapy in 4 different clinical trials and with available [18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose positron emission tomography-CT (FDG-PET/CT) scans at baseline and at least one follow-up scan 6\u20138 weeks and/or 12\u201316 weeks post-TIL infusion were included. Results: Obtaining complete metabolic response (CMR) was associated with significantly superior median overall survival (mOS) compared with not obtaining CMR (p<0.0001). Of particular interest, metabolic response divided RECIST partial responders (22 patients) into two groups with significantly different clinical outcomes. Neither mOS (range 32.2\u2013149.8+) nor median progression-free survival (mPFS; range 20.7\u2013123.4+) were reached for patients with partial response (PR)/CMR (10 patients), whereas patients with PR/non-CMR (12 patients) had a mOS of 28.7 months (p=0.0016) and a mPFS of 7.8 months (p<0.0001). Overall, not achieving a CMR was associated with a short mPFS of 3.2 months, and 97.9% (47/48) of all patients in this group progressed within 12 months. Conclusion: In conclusion, early CMR is a strong predictor of long-term survival after TIL therapy in metastatic melanoma patients. Furthermore, FDG-PET/CT scans appear superior to CT scans for providing early prognostic information after TIL therapy in melanoma and can be used to tailor patient-specific management and follow-up strategies.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-01", "synthetic_support_claim": "Early complete metabolic response (CMR) predicts long-term survival after TIL therapy in metastatic melanoma patients.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "TIL therapy leads to permanent remission in all patients with metastatic melanoma."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "d85cb223192c5f1e57c9fa6bf49bcff697eb7826", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d85cb223192c5f1e57c9fa6bf49bcff697eb7826", "title": "Unadjuvanted intranasal spike vaccine elicits protective mucosal immunity against sarbecoviruses", "abstract": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has highlighted the need for vaccines that not only prevent disease but also prevent transmission. Parenteral vaccines induce robust systemic immunity but poor immunity at the respiratory mucosa. We developed a vaccine strategy that we call \u201cprime and spike,\u201d which leverages existing immunity generated by primary vaccination (prime) to elicit mucosal immune memory within the respiratory tract by using unadjuvanted intranasal spike boosters (spike). We show that prime and spike induces robust resident memory B and T cell responses, induces immunoglobulin A at the respiratory mucosa, boosts systemic immunity, and completely protects mice with partial immunity from lethal SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using divergent spike proteins, prime and spike enables the induction of cross-reactive immunity against sarbecoviruses. Description Prime and Spike passes the sniff test Nearly 2 years after COVID-19 vaccines became widely available, a combination of waning vaccine-induced immunity and unabated viral mutations have resulted in reduced vaccine effectiveness. Mao et al. developed an alternative vaccine-boosting strategy they call \u201cprime and spike\u201d in animal models of COVID-19. After primary vaccination with a messenger RNA vaccine (\u201cprime\u201d), animals received an intranasal dose of unadjuvanted severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein (\u201cspike\u201d). This approach resulted in robust cellular and antibody-based immunity in the mucosa that protected animals as strongly and durably as a parenteral boost while also blocking viral transmission better. Spike could be administered in a variety of formulations and, if derived from SARS-CoV-1, could offer strong cross-protection against both viruses. \u2014STS An intranasal spike protein boost generates broadly protective anti-sarbecovirus mucosal immunity in animals. INTRODUCTION During the first year of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, multiple highly effective vaccines have been developed, using new technologies such as modified mRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles and replication-deficient adenoviral vectors. Initial trials showed vaccine effectiveness >90% against symptomatic disease. Additional studies showed decreased infection rates of household contacts of vaccinated individuals, suggesting decreased rates of transmission. Unfortunately, waning immunity to vaccines and continued viral evolution with increasingly transmissible and immune-evasive variants have led to decreased vaccine effectiveness. Vaccines have also become much less effective at preventing transmission, which may be in part because of the poor induction of mucosal immunity within the respiratory tract. RATIONALE Although the goal of vaccination has been to prevent individual morbidity and mortality, the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 throughout the pandemic has highlighted the need for vaccines that better prevent transmission. Parenteral vaccines induce robust systemic immunity that is protective against disease. However, they induce poor immunity within the upper respiratory mucosa, where viral transmission occurs. Preclinical studies of both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus have demonstrated that intranasal vaccination decreases viral shedding and transmission relative to parenteral vaccines. Despite these studies, there is only one currently approved respiratory mucosal vaccine, FluMist, which is a live cold-adapted influenza virus. Most current clinical trials of mucosally administered SARS-CoV-2 vaccines rely on either replication-deficient or attenuated viral vectors, the safety and efficacy of which have yet to be established. All of these strategies become less effective with the development of antivector immunity. Here, we instead leverage preexisting immunity to boost mucosal immunity by intranasally administering unadjuvanted spike protein or mRNA. This consequently avoids the use of viral vectors or adjuvants in the respiratory tract. RESULTS We describe the preclinical development of an alternative vaccine strategy that we term \u201cprime and spike\u201d (P&S), which uses existing immunity generated by primary vaccination (prime) to elicit mucosal immune memory within the respiratory tract by using unadjuvanted intranasal spike booster. P&S elicits robust mucosal cellular and humoral memory responses, including the establishment of tissue-resident memory CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, and B cells. Additionally, we found robust induction of mucosal immunoglobulin A (IgA) and IgG. Intranasal boosters can be delivered through distinct vaccine formulations, ranging from unadjuvanted trimeric recombinant spike proteins to spike-encoding mRNA encapsulated by immunosilent poly(amine-co-ester) (PACE) polymers. We found that an intranasal unadjuvanted spike booster can be administered months out from primary immunization and offers systemic neutralizing antibody responses comparable with that of mRNA\u2013lipid nanoparticle (LNP) boost. P&S shows durability, leading to protection from lethal SCV2 challenge for as long as 118 days from vaccination. P&S is protective in hamsters and is superior to mRNA-LNP prime-boost at blocking transmission. Last, by using a divergent spike antigen from SARS-CoV-1, we demonstrate that P&S can generate mucosal immunity to SCV1 while also boosting systemic and mucosal neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION SARS-CoV-2 will continue to evolve and become more immune evasive and transmissible. We will require boosting in human populations for the foreseeable future. The respiratory mucosa provides a formidable barrier against viral pathogens after P&S administration. Therefore, strengthening mucosal immunity through vaccination holds substantial promise for enhancing protection and mitigating transmission. As new variants emerge, it will be a vital tool in combating other respiratory pathogens and the next pandemic. A parenteral prime-unadjuvanted mucosal boost vaccine that elicits mucosal immunity against sarbecoviruses. P&S converts systemic immunity generated by primary vaccination into local immunity in the respiratory mucosa. P&S affords protection against disease development, respiratory viral replication, and contact transmission after SARS-CoV-2 (SCV2) infection.

Mucosal immunity within the respiratory tract includes tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells and tissue-resident memory B (BRM) cells, which provides rapid and efficient protection against RSV re-infection. Therefore, vaccine strategies should aim to generate mucosal immune responses. However, the interactions between RSV vaccines and mucosal immune responses within the respiratory tract are poorly understood. We evaluated a mucosal immune system following immunization by RSV vaccine with poly-sorbitol transporter (RSV-PST), a nanoparticle adjuvant. Methods: We intranasally immunized the RSV-PST and identified the systemic and mucosal immune responses. Furthermore, we challenged with RSV A2 strain after immunization and investigated the protective effects. Results: Consequently, antigen-specific CD8+ TRM cells were markedly elevated in the lung parenchyma, yet exhibited impaired cytokine expression. In contrast, humoral immunity, with systemic antibody production from serum, but not in the respiratory tract, was significantly increased by RSV-PST immunization. Interestingly, the production of respiratory mucosal antigen-specific IgG after RSV A2 challenge dramatically increased in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of the RSV-PST immunized group in the presence of FTY720, and the lung-infected RSV titer was significantly lower in this group. Furthermore, after RSV A2 challenge, CD69+ IgG+ BRM cells were significantly increased in lung tissues in the RSV-PST group.

DM is a group of metabolic disorders characterized by hyperglycemia leading to micro- and macro-vascular complications. Chronic low-grade inflammation is associated with the pathophysiology of DM.\nAims and Objectives: The present study aimed to assess the levels of neutrophil-to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), systemic inflammation response index (SIRI), and other inflammatory markers in T2DM patients and their correlation with blood sugar and HbA1c.\nMaterials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in Department of Biochemistry in association with Department of General Medicine and Pathology, NRI Institute of Medical Sciences (NRIIMS), Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, India. In this study, 90 T2DM patients and 90 non-diabetic subjects were recruited. Fasting and post-prandial blood samples were collected and used for the estimation of blood sugar, urea, creatinine, and lipid profile parameters. Whole blood (EDTA) samples were used for analysis of complete blood count (CBC) and HbA1c. NLR, PLR, SII, SIRI, MHR, NHR, LHR, and PHR were calculated from CBC values. Demographic details were collected.\nResults: In this study, significant increase in blood pressure (systolic [120.4\u00b18.1 mmHg], diastolic [80.2\u00b14.8 mmHg]), fasting blood sugar (FBS) (162.5\u00b153.7 mg/dL), post-prandial blood sugar (238.3\u00b178.8 mg/dL), HbA1c (8.5\u00b12.2%), urea (28.6\u00b18.6 mg/dL), creatinine (1.1\u00b10.2 mg/dL), total cholesterol (186.8\u00b146.1 mg/dL), triglycerides (168.9\u00b161.2 mg/dL), LDLC (115.0\u00b136.3 mg/dL), VLDL (33.8\u00b112.4 mg/dL), and neutrophil count (66.6\u00b111.4%) was observed in T2DM cases.

The aim of this study is to update the literature by producing Medicare projections for primary total joint arthroplasty (TJA) procedures until 2040 and 2060. Methods: The present study used data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Medicare/Medicaid Part B National Summary and combined procedure counts with use of Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes to identify whether the procedure was a primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) or total knee arthroplasty (TKA) procedure. In 2019, the annual volume of primary TKA was 480,958 and that of primary THA was 262,369. These values formed a baseline from which we generated point forecasts for 2020-2060 and 95% forecast intervals (FIs). Results: Between 2000 and 2019, the estimated annual volume of THA increased by 177% and that of TKA increased by 156% on average. Regression analysis projected an annual growth rate of 5.2% for THA and 4.44% for TKA. Based on these yearly projected increases, an estimated increase of 28.84% and 24.28% is expected for each 5-year period after 2020 for THA and TKA, respectively. By 2040, the number of THAs is projected to be 719,364 (95% FI, 624,766 to 828,286) and the number of TKA is projected to be 1,222,988 (95% FI, 988,714 to 1,512,772). By 2060, the number of THAs is projected to be 1,982,099 (95% FI, 1,624,215 to 2,418,839) and the number of TKAs is projected to be 2,917,959 (95% FI, 2,160,951 to 3,940,156). In 2019, Medicare data showed that THA constituted approximately 35% of TJA procedures performed. Conclusions: Based on 2019 total volume counts, our model forecasts an increase in THA procedures of 176% by 2040 and 659% by 2060. The estimated increase for TKA is projected to be 139% by 2040 and 469% by 2060. An accurate projection of future primary TJA procedure demands is important in order to understand future health-care utilization and surgeon demand.

While opioid analgesics have traditionally been used, concerns over their adverse effects and the opioid epidemic have driven exploration of alternative pain management strategies. Multimodal (MM) pain control, targeting multiple pain pathways, has emerged as a promising approach, encompassing various medications and administration routes. Cryoneurolysis, a non-opioid therapy, has garnered attention for its potential in acute pain management, including its use before and after TKA. Methods: This study is a systematic review aiming to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cryoneurolysis as a method for managing perioperative pain in TKA. Primary outcomes include a reduction in opioid consumption and length of hospital stay, while secondary outcomes encompass functional and pain-related scores. Results: Seven of 434 studies met inclusion criteria. Published between 2016 and 2023, these included five retrospective studies and two randomized controlled trials, involving a total of 794 patients (38.3% male, 61.7% female). Most studies had a clearly defined control group, and the mean age of participants was approximately 66.6 years. The methodological assessment indicated a moderate to low risk of bias. Results demonstrated that cryoneurolysis reduced opioid consumption and improved pain and functional outcomes compared to control groups, including shorter hospital stays, improved range of motion, and pain score improvements.

The hypothesis was that revision of both the acetabular and femoral components and using a dual-mobility acetabular component would provide a lower postoperative risk of dislocation, without increasing perioperative morbidity and mortality.\n\n\nMethods\nData were retrospectively analyzed from a continuously gathered database. We included 150 revisions, performed between January 2015 and December 2022, in 150 patients, with 81 revisions limited to only the femoral component and 69 involving revision of both components. This resulted, after surgery, in 60 patients having a simple-mobility acetabular component and 90 having a dual-mobility component. The mean age of the patients was 79.7 years (SD 10.1), and 98 were female (65.3%). The mean follow-up was 31 months (SD 2.3).\n\n\nResults\nThere were no significant differences between those in whom only the femoral component was revised and those in whom both components were revised with the use of a dual-mobility acetabular component for the rate of intraoperative complications, postoperative mortality, blood loss, the requirement of a blood transfusion, medical complications, dislocation (11/81 in the femoral component-only group vs 6/69 in the femoral + acetabular component revision group) or the overall need for reoperation at the final follow-up. Patients were at a significantly higher risk for dislocation when a simple-mobility component was retained (18.3% (n = 11) vs 6.7% (n = 6) for dual-mobility implants; p = 0.036). The revision rate prompted by postoperative instability was significantly higher in patients in whom a simple-mobility acetabular component was retained at revision (10% (n = 6) vs 0%; p = 0.002).\n\n\nConclusion\nBased on these results, concurrent revision of the acetabular component was not associated with a higher rate of mortality or increased morbidity and patients in whom a dual-mobility acetabular component was used were significantly less prone to dislocation.

AFL is classified into typical, or cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI)-dependent, and atypical, or non-CTI-dependent. Atypical AFL is a heterogenous group of re-entrant atrial tachycardias that most commonly occur in patients with prior heart surgery or catheter ablation. The ECG pattern is poorly predictive of circuit anatomy but may still provide mechanistic insight. AFL is difficult to manage medically and catheter ablation is the preferred treatment for most patients. Recent progress in technology and clinical electrophysiology has led to detailed characterization of re-entry circuits and effective ablation strategies. Combined activation and entrainment mapping are key to identifying the re-entry circuit. The presence of a slow-conducting isthmus, localized re-entry, dual-loop re-entry or bystander loops may lead to misleading activation maps but can be identified by electrogram examination and entrainment mapping. In the occasional patient without inducible AFL, substrate mapping in sinus rhythm may be a viable strategy. Long-term ablation success requires the creation of a transmural continuous lesion across a critical component of the re-entry circuit.

This study investigates whether preoperative ablation complicates thyroidectomy and poses challenges for pathological diagnosis. Study Design: This retrospective cohort study used prospectively collected institutional registry data on patients with benign thyroid nodules who underwent thyroidectomy after prior radiofrequency ablation. Perioperative outcomes, including thyroidectomy difficulty scale (TDS) and macroscopic adhesion score (MAS), were compared with a control group without prior ablation. Histopathological and cytological changes within the ablated zone and periphery were also evaluated. Results: This study included 165 patients, with 145 in the nonablation group and 20 in the postablation group (17 females, mean age 53.4 years, mean nodule size 4.4 cm, mean interval between ablation and thyroidectomy 29.5 months). Compared with the nonablation group, the ablation group had longer operative time (99.5 vs. 69.5 minutes, p < 0.05), higher TDS (9 vs. 6, p < 0.05), more severe MAS (anterior 50.0% vs. 16.6%, p < 0.05; posterior: 35.0% vs. 16.6%, p < 0.05), and increased incidental parathyroidectomies (10.7% vs. 1.6%, p < 0.05). Histopathologically, the ablated area showed acellular hyalinization (95%), coagulative necrosis (60%), and chronic inflammation (85%). Both central and peripheral regions displayed cytological alterations (nuclear enlargement, focal chromatin clearing, and clear-cell change). Challenges in defining tumor capsule integrity were noted in eight follicular neoplasms, complicating the diagnosis of three follicular carcinomas and two follicular tumors of uncertain malignant potential.

However, given that not all solid thyroid nodules are malignant, a more conservative approach may also be appropriate in certain cases. Objective This study aims to present an illustrative analysis of the pathological foundations underlying the sonographic appearance of benign, borderline, and malignant thyroid nodules in the pediatric population at a single tertiary thyroid center. Methods A total of 47 well-documented pediatric patients referred for thyroid surgery between 2010 and 2023 were analyzed. This retrospective assessment included an examination of demographic data, hormonal profiles, ultrasound findings, and histopathology reports. Results Ultrasound and histopathology of thyroid nodules provided insights into subgroup differentiation. Benign nodules like dyshormonogenetic goiter showed solid hypoechoic features on ultrasound and dense fibrosis on histopathology, while thyroid follicular nodular disease exhibited isoechoic nodules with halos, histologically revealing dilated follicles. In borderline tumors, well-differentiated tumor of uncertain malignant potential (WDT-UMP) nodules were hypo/hyperechoic with occasional capsular invasion, resembling papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) features histologically. Non-invasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP) appeared as well-defined hypoechoic nodules with a hypoechoic rim, with histology showing follicular architecture and PTC nuclear features, but no invasion. Follicular tumor of uncertain malignant potential (FT-UMP) displayed hypo/hyperechoic patterns and indistinct borders, with uncertain capsular invasion and no PTC nuclear features. Malignant lesions showed distinct patterns: PTC as hypoechoic, irregular nodules with mixed vascularization, follicular thyroid carcinoma as large, hyperechoic nodules with invasive features, and poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma (PDTC) as heterogeneous hypoechoic masses. Conclusion Because of the significant overlap in sonographic features among benign, borderline, and certain malignant thyroid lesions in pediatric patients, ultrasonography alone is insufficient for accurate risk stratification.

Methods & results Our findings associate Programmed Death- Ligand1 (PD-L1) with the RPA1-ETAA1 axis, suggesting that upregulated RPA1 -dependent ETAA1 may facilitate PD-L1 nuclear accumulation. We observed strong correlations between ETAA1 and RPA1 with the components involved in HDAC2-mediated deacetylation, clathrin -dependent endocytosis, and PD-L1 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, aligning with the established regulatory pathway of PD-L1 nuclear translocation. Moreover, nuclear PD-L1 transactivates a panel of pro-inflammatory and immune response transcription factors, potentially reshaping the tumor immune microenvironment. We identified a landscape of infiltrating lymphocytes influenced by ETAA1, finding that levels of ETAA1 were negatively correlated with CD8+ T and Natural Killer T (NKT) cells, but positively correlated with CD4+ T helper 2 (Th2) cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), neutrophils and regulatory T cells (Tregs), suggesting a potential role in immune evasion.

Many clinical trials have demonstrated that ICIs improve the survival and the quality of life of patients with advanced non oncogene NSCLC as compared to standard therapies. However, not all patients achieve a clinical benefit from this immunotherapeutic approach. As a result, real-word validation of the efficacy and safety of ICIs can be useful for defining potential predictive biomarkers as well as for overcoming limitations linked to clinical trial restrictions.

Methods A consensus conference of 32 critical care ARDS experts was convened, had six virtual meetings (June 2021 to March 2022), and subsequently obtained input from members of several critical care societies. The goal was to develop a definition that would 1) identify patients with the currently accepted conceptual framework for ARDS, 2) facilitate rapid ARDS diagnosis for clinical care and research, 3) be applicable in resource-limited settings, 4) be useful for testing specific therapies, and 5) be practical for communication to patients and caregivers.

However, ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) is primarily determined by ventilator settings, namely tidal volume, respiratory rate, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). All these variables, along with respiratory elastance, are included in the concept of mechanical power. The aim of this study is to investigate whether applied mechanical power is proportional to oxygenation severity. Methods: We analyzed 291 ARDS patients (71 mild, 155 moderate, and 65 severe). We defined low, middle, and high mechanical power by dividing the entire population into tertiles with a similar number of patients. In each oxygenation class, we measured computed tomography (CT) anatomy, gas exchange, respiratory mechanics, mechanical power, and mortality rate. Results: ARDS severity was proportional to lung anatomy impairment, as defined by quantitative CT scans (i.e., lung volume and well-aerated tissue decreased across the ARDS classes, while respiratory elastance increased, as did mortality). Mechanical power, however, was similarly distributed across the severity classes, as the decrease in tidal volume in severe ARDS was offset by an increase in respiratory rate. Within each ARDS class, mortality increased from low to high mechanical power (roughly 1% for each J/min increase).

Early detection of CKD enables patients to receive timely treatment to ameliorate the progression of this disease. Machine learning models can effectively aid clinicians achieve this goal due to their fast and accurate recognition performance. In this study, we propose a machine learning methodology for diagnosing CKD. The CKD data set was obtained from the University of California Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository, which has a large number of missing values. KNN imputation was used to fill in the missing values, which selects several complete samples with the most similar measurements to process the missing data for each incomplete sample. Missing values are usually seen in real-life medical situations because patients may miss some measurements for various reasons. After effectively filling out the incomplete data set, six machine learning algorithms (logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, naive Bayes classifier and feed forward neural network) were used to establish models. Among these machine learning models, random forest achieved the best performance with 99.75% diagnosis accuracy. By analyzing the misjudgments generated by the established models, we proposed an integrated model that combines logistic regression and random forest by using perceptron, which could achieve an average accuracy of 99.83% after ten times of simulation.

There are three GPX4 isoforms: cytosolic (cGPX4), mitochondrial (mGPX4), and nuclear (nGPX4), with distinct spatiotemporal expression patterns during embryonic development and adult life. In addition to inducing the main phenotype of ferroptosis, the loss of GPX4 can in some cells trigger apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, or parthanatos, which mediates or accelerates developmental defects, tissue damage, and sterile inflammation. The interaction of GPX4 with the autophagic degradation pathway further modulates cell fate in response to oxidative stress. Impaired GPX4 function is implicated in tumorigenesis, neurodegeneration, infertility, inflammation, immune disorders, and ischemia-reperfusion injury. Additionally, the R152H mutation in GPX4 can promote the development of Sedaghatian-type spinal metaphyseal dysplasia, a rare and fatal disease in newborns.

However, its clinical application is constrained due to its severe and irreversible side effects, particularly heart damage. Ferroptosis, characterized by iron accumulation and redox system imbalance, serves a key role in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. Ophiopogon japonicus polysaccharide (OJP) exhibits diverse pharmacological activities, including cardiovascular protection, and anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and immune regulatory effects. However, the role and mechanism of OJP in DOX-mediated ferroptosis-triggered injury in cardiomyocytes remain elusive. The present study aimed to assess the effect of OJP on DOX-induced myocardial ferroptosis injury and to reveal its underlying anti-ferroptosis mechanism. The detection of myocardial injury markers, such as LDH, indicated that OJP can ameliorate myocardial damage. Additionally, western blot analyses reveal that OJP decreases the expression levels of the ferroptosis-related marker transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1) while simultaneously increasing expression levels of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, fluorescence probe assays demonstrate that OJP not only reduces iron accumulation and oxidative stress but also inhibits the production of lipid peroxidation, as evidenced by a decrease in malondialdehyde (MDA) levels measured. In addition, OJP simultaneously decreased ferroptosis by enhancing mitochondrial function. Mechanistically, OJP attenuated ferroptosis by upregulating the endogenous key antioxidant factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), which in turn increased the expression of the downstream signaling molecule GPX4 and reduced the accumulation of the labile iron pool.

Currently, therapies and their efficacy for kidney diseases are limited. Ferroptosis is a newly discovered iron-dependent regulated cell death. The imbalance of iron homeostasis and lipid metabolism affects the occurrence and progression of kidney diseases by triggering ferroptosis, which is considered an important target for the development of kidney disease drugs. However, in clinical practice, targeted ferroptosis therapy for kidney diseases faces obstacles such as poor drug solubility, low drug resistance, and imprecise targeting.

Results 1645 articles were screened but no randomised controlled trials were found. 16 observational studies from five countries (USA, UK, France, Italy, and the Netherlands) were identified that reported on 614\u2009392 patients. The most common symptoms of long covid that were studied were fatigue, cough, loss of sense of smell, shortness of breath, loss of taste, headache, muscle ache, difficulty sleeping, difficulty concentrating, worry or anxiety, and memory loss or confusion. 12 studies reported data on vaccination before infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and 10 showed a significant reduction in the incidence of long covid: the odds ratio of developing long covid with one dose of vaccine ranged from 0.22 to 1.03; with two doses, odds ratios were 0.25-1; with three doses, 0.16; and with any dose, 0.48-1.01.

This study aims to integrate molecular and clinical data to produce individualized prognosis predictions that can further improve treatment selection. METHODS Clinical variables and somatic mutation data for 20 genes from 641 patients with RMS in the United Kingdom and the United States were used to develop three Cox proportional hazard models for predicting event-free survival (EFS). The Baseline Clinical (BC) model included treatment location, age, fusion status, and risk group. The Gene Enhanced 2 (GE2) model added TP53 and MYOD1 mutations to the BC predictors. The Gene Enhanced 6 (GE6) model further included NF1, MET, CDKN2A, and MYCN mutations, selected through least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression. Model performance was assessed using likelihood ratio tests and optimism-adjusted, bootstrapped validation and calibration metrics. RESULTS The GE6 model demonstrated superior predictive performance compared with the BC model (P < .001) and GE2 model (P < .001). The GE6 model achieved the highest discrimination with a time-dependent area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.766. Mutations in TP53, MYOD1, CDKN2A, MET, and MYCN were associated with higher hazards, while NF1 mutation correlated with lower hazard. Individual prognosis predictions varied between models in ways that may suggest different treatments for the same patient. For example, the 5-year EFS for a 10-year-old patient with high-risk, fusion-negative, NF1-positive disease was 50.0% (95% CI, 39 to 64) from BC but 76% (64 to 90) from GE6.

However, the extracellular matrix (ECM), which comprises at least a third of tissue structures, remains relatively underexplored in immunology. Similarly, matrix biologists often overlook regulation of complex structural matrices by the immune system. We are only beginning to understand the scale at which ECM structures determine immune cell localization and function. Additionally, we need to better understand how immune cells dictate ECM complexity. This review aims to highlight the potential for biological discovery at the interface of immunology and matrix biology. Description Immune cells in the extracellular matrix The extracellular matrix is a dynamic tissue support network that is made up of components including fibrillar proteins, glycosaminoglycans, proteoglycans, and mucus. There is growing knowledge that this network has an intricate relationship with immune cells, which has important implications for our understanding of host defense, wound repair, fibrotic disease, and aging. Sutherland et al. reviewed the latest research on the interconnectedness of these systems with an emphasis on how this cross talk is an important element in the success (or failure) of immune cell\u2013based therapies. \u2014STS A review explains that the extracellular matrix and immune system are highly interconnected networks integral to tissue homeostasis and disease. BACKGROUND The extracellular matrix (ECM) forms a dynamic structure around cells that is essential for the supply of environmental factors, mechanical support, and protection of tissues. It includes components such as fibrillar proteins, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), proteoglycans, and mucus. The molecular, physical, and mechanical properties of the ECM regulate immune cell mobility, survival, and function. In turn, the immune system maintains and regulates healthy matrix and restores matrix integrity after injury. A dysregulated ECM\u2013immune system partnership contributes to most diseases. Exploring the complex interconnectivity between ECM biology and immune cells has the potential to help treat disease and maintain healthy aging. ADVANCES Immune cells are perpetually in contact with the ECM, yet the potential consequences of these interactions often remain unexplored. One function of the ECM is to guide immune cell movement and positioning. T cells, for example, move through sites containing thin ECM fibers in preference to more densely cross-linked collagen matrices, whereas heparan sulfate proteoglycans within the vasculature and tissue parenchyma bind and present chemokines to form gradients that direct cell movement. During inflammation, injury, infection, or even aging, ECM components can be released to act as \u201cdanger signals.\u201d Conversely, the breakdown of the ECM by matrix-degrading enzymes can generate immunoregulatory fragments. Critically, because cytokines are often bound to GAGs, ECM changes can regulate cytokine availability or activity. During aging and fibrotic diseases, changes to the fibrillar collagen network result in pathological tissue stiffness and loss of mechanical compliance. Additionally, increases in the GAG hyaluronan contribute to altered ECM mechanical properties that accompany aging and disease. There is increasing evidence that immune cell function is regulated by mechanosensing receptors such as Piezo1, and these ECM changes have major impacts on immune function. Furthermore, a decline in the activity of the mechanosensing transcriptional activators YAP and TAZ during physiological aging results in failure to down-regulate inflammation. Thus, ECM composition actively regulates immune processes, but immune signals will themselves regulate ECM composition, reflecting an essential bidirectional dialog. One prominent way that the immune system regulates the ECM is through transforming growth factor\u2013\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), which promotes myofibroblast differentiation and collagen production and inhibits matrix-degrading metalloproteinases. Furthermore, type 2 cytokines, particularly interleukin-13 (IL-13), have emerged as modulators of ECM quantity and quality, which includes regulating the mucosal barrier. Moreover, direct biophysical interaction with chemokines or cytokines can alter ECM structure and/or function. For instance, CXCL4 (PF4) functions by binding to GAGs rather than by directly binding to chemokine receptors. This can lead to remodeling of the cell surface ECM and signaling through proteoglycans. Immune cells control ECM not only through the production of cytokines and chemokines but also by direct synthesis of ECM components and the enzymes that break them down. Enzymatic remodeling of the rigid basement membrane by tissue-infiltrating myeloid cells, for example, can provide routes for lymphocytes to follow. Macrophages, which are pivotal in ECM turnover through receptor-mediated uptake of and degradation of collagen, also produce collagens that may provide templates for tissue remodeling. Neutrophils can pull and carry preexisting matrix from nearby sites to wound beds early in the tissue repair process to reestablish new ECM scaffolds. OUTLOOK The ECM, long considered an inert scaffold, can now be seen as a highly dynamic partner to the immune system. In this review, we aim to highlight the absolute interdependence of these systems with consequences for therapy. For example, immune cell\u2013based therapies may fail if they are placed in diseased matrix that itself drives pathology. Ultimately, to answer the most pressing questions in tissue health, it will be critical that immunologists and matrix biologists work together. Interconnectivity between the ECM and the immune system. (A) Physical and molecular properties of the ECM control immune cell positioning and migration within a tissue during pathology. (B) Aging not only alters the mechanical properties of ECM, which are sensed by the immune system, but also reduces mechanosensors that down-regulate proinflammatory pathways. (C and D) The immunomodulatory cytokine IL-13 can remodel the mucus barrier (C), whereas immune cells themselves can carry matrix across tissues to help build an ECM scaffold for repair (D).

Since then, the impact of prehabilitation has been evaluated in multiple cancer types with beneficial results. This review aims to describe the benefits of rehabilitation in the cancer continuum and the effects on the different disease groups. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2024-11-26", "synthetic_support_claim": "Prehabilitation improves patients\u2019 physical, mental, and nutritional status before oncological treatment, reducing future impairments.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Prehabilitation leads to long-term survival benefits in cancer patients regardless of cancer type."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "3d755392386cff3986aadee9fc222743dc2cc409", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3d755392386cff3986aadee9fc222743dc2cc409", "title": "Evaluating the therapeutic quality of prehabilitation programmes in patients scheduled for colorectal surgery: A systematic review and meta\u2010analysis", "abstract": "Abstract Aim The aim of this work was to evaluate whether the therapeutic quality of exercise prehabilitation programmes is associated with their effectiveness to preoperatively improve aerobic fitness and reduce postoperative complications and length of hospital stay in patients scheduled for colorectal surgery. Method Three electronic databases (PubMed, Embase and CINAHL) were systematically searched (up to October 2023) for randomized controlled trials that investigated the effects of prehabilitation before colorectal resection. Methodological quality and therapeutic quality were assessed using, respectively, the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool and the i\u2010CONTENT tool. Studies were divided into four subgroups based on the estimated risk of bias and risk of ineffectiveness. Results Fourteen studies were included, comprising 986 patients. Meta\u2010analysis showed that, in general, prehabilitation improved preoperative aerobic fitness but did not improve postoperative outcomes. No differences were found between the four subgroups; however, only one study (7%) had a low risk of bias in combination with a low risk of ineffectiveness. Conclusion The fact that only one study had a low risk of bias in combination with a low risk of ineffectiveness precluded us from establishing an association between therapeutic quality and the effectiveness of prehabilitation on postoperative outcomes.

A total of 190,891 individuals who participated in health checkups at the Health Promotion Center of Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital of Zhejiang University from January 2017 to December 2021 were included in this cross-sectional study.

The Reshape T1D study aims to apply these principles to understand how individuals living with T1D interact with and experience healthcare to inform T1D clinical quality improvement. Methods Using a community\u2010based participatory research design, we involved four patients and four clinicians as co\u2010researchers throughout the research. A questionnaire and virtual semi\u2010structured interview were applied across a purposeful sample of 41 adults living with T1D across Alberta, Canada, between September 2021 and May 2022. Audio recordings were transcribed verbatim and de\u2010identified before coding. Thematic analysis was conducted on coded participant discourse through multiple coders. Results Participants indicated the need for a centralized hub that provides consistent, reliable, and up\u2010to\u2010date T1D education and resources and an emphasis on access to mental health resources within T1D care settings. Providing greater flexibility for appointment types (ie. in\u2010person, virtual, etc.) and after\u2010hours access contributed to better self\u2010management and prevented emergency room visits. Participants desired a choice as to who comprises their T1D care team and for teams to address patient needs specific to their reality. We identified that medical trauma had long\u2010term impacts on perceptions of healthcare and contributed to a reluctance to seek future care. Women expressed challenges in discussing reproductive health with their clinicians. Diabetes online communities provide an adjunct to clinical care through peer support. Cost and access to the latest technology are ongoing barriers for many participants, especially concerning publicly funded programmes that use advanced insulin pump therapy, continuous glucose monitoring, and automated insulin delivery systems. A quality improvement framework emerged through data analysis, and findings were synthesized into actionable recommendations for ongoing clinical quality improvement.

A substantial body of evidence indicates that this characteristic pattern of responses can be explained by the action of SGLT2 inhibitors to promote cellular housekeeping by enhancing autophagic flux, an effect that may be related to the action of these drugs to produce simultaneous upregulation of nutrient deprivation signaling and downregulation of nutrient surplus signaling, as manifested by an increase in the expression and activity of AMPK (adenosine monophosphate\u2013activated protein kinase), SIRT1 (sirtuin 1), SIRT3 (sirtuin 3), SIRT6 (sirtuin 6), and PGC1-\u03b1 (peroxisome proliferator\u2013activated receptor \u03b3 coactivator 1-\u03b1) and decreased activation of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin). The distinctive pattern of cardioprotective and renoprotective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors is abolished by specific inhibition or knockdown of autophagy, AMPK, and sirtuins. In the clinical setting, the pattern of differentially increased proteins identified in proteomics analyses of blood collected in randomized trials is consistent with these findings. Clinical studies have also shown that SGLT2 inhibitors promote gluconeogenesis, ketogenesis, and erythrocytosis and reduce uricemia, the hallmarks of nutrient deprivation signaling and the principal statistical mediators of the ability of SGLT2 inhibitors to reduce the risk of heart failure and serious renal events. The action of SGLT2 inhibitors to augment autophagic flux is seen in isolated cells and tissues that do not express SGLT2 and are not exposed to changes in environmental glucose or ketones and may be related to an ability of these drugs to bind directly to sirtuins or mTOR. Changes in renal or cardiovascular physiology or metabolism cannot explain the benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors either experimentally or clinically. The direct molecular effects of SGLT2 inhibitors in isolated cells are consistent with the concept that SGLT2 acts as a nutrient surplus sensor, and thus, its inhibition causes enhanced nutrient deprivation signaling and its attendant cytoprotective effects, which can be abolished by specific inhibition or knockdown of AMPK, sirtuins, and autophagic flux.", "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-11-01", "synthetic_support_claim": "SGLT2 inhibitors promote cellular housekeeping by enhancing autophagic flux through nutrient deprivation signaling.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "SGLT2 inhibitors promote significant weight loss in patients with cardiomyopathy and nephropathy."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "206ef72494d5c761a9946d1230ba23aebe98ad77", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/206ef72494d5c761a9946d1230ba23aebe98ad77", "title": "Early combination therapy with SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA or dual GIP/GLP-1 RA in type 2 diabetes.", "abstract": "Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and glucagon-Like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) are recommended in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) for glycaemic control and for people with high cardiovascular risk.

This review synthesizes the available evidence on the use of SGLT2i and GLP-1-based therapies for T2D and provides a rationale for their combination. The combination of SGLT2i with GLP-1-based therapies addresses complementary pathophysiological mechanisms and enhances efficacy in achieving target haemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) levels.

Both drug classes have favourable safety profiles. Finally, weight loss with combination therapy may have disease-modifying effects that may reverse T2D progression.

Most individuals diagnosed with T2D exhibit adiposopathy-related diabetes (ARD), a condition characterized by hyperglycemia accompanied by three core features: increased ectopic and visceral fat deposition, dysregulated adipokine secretion favoring a pro-inflammatory state, and insulin resistance. Despite advancements in precision medicine, international guidelines for T2D continue to prioritize individualized therapeutic approaches focused on glycemic control and complications, and many healthcare providers predominantly maintain a glucocentric strategy. This review advocates for an adipocentric treatment paradigm for most individuals with T2D, emphasizing the importance of prioritizing weight loss and visceral fat reduction as key drivers of therapeutic intensification. By combining lifestyle modifications with pharmacological agents that promote weight loss\u2014including SGLT-2 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists, or dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists\u2014and, when appropriate, metabolic surgery, this approach offers the potential for disease remission in patients with shorter disease duration. For others, it enables superior metabolic control compared to traditional glucose-centered strategies while simultaneously delivering cardiovascular and renal benefits. In conclusion, an adipocentric treatment framework for ARD, which represents the majority of T2D cases, effectively integrates glucocentric and cardio-nephrocentric goals.

In addition, peri-implantitis is particularly challenging to manage and is accompanied by significant morbidity.\n\n\nAIM\nTo develop an S3 level CPG for the prevention and treatment of peri-implant diseases, focusing on the implementation of interdisciplinary approaches required to prevent the development of peri-implant diseases or their recurrence, and to treat/rehabilitate patients with dental implants following the development of peri-implant diseases.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nThis S3 level CPG was developed by the European Federation of Periodontology, following methodological guidance from the Association of Scientific Medical Societies in Germany and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation process. A rigorous and transparent process included synthesis of relevant research in 13 specifically commissioned systematic reviews, evaluation of the quality and strength of evidence, formulation of specific recommendations, and a structured consensus process involving leading experts and a broad base of stakeholders.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe S3 level CPG for the prevention and treatment of peri-implant diseases culminated in the recommendation for implementation of various different interventions before, during and after implant placement/loading. Prevention of peri-implant diseases should commence when dental implants are planned, surgically placed and prosthetically loaded. Once the implants are loaded and in function, a supportive peri-implant care programme should be structured, including periodical assessment of peri-implant tissue health. If peri-implant mucositis or peri-implantitis are detected, appropriate treatments for their management must be rendered.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe present S3 level CPG informs clinical practice, health systems, policymakers and, indirectly, the public on the available and most effective modalities to maintain healthy peri-implant tissues, and to manage peri-implant diseases, according to the available evidence at the time of publication.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-06-01", "synthetic_support_claim": "Prevention of peri-implant diseases should start when planning, surgically placing, and prosthetically loading implants.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Laser therapy is the most effective treatment for peri-implantitis compared to other available interventions."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "43ba52f0efcf33053c8c8e26836420928c6ae853", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/43ba52f0efcf33053c8c8e26836420928c6ae853", "title": "Unraveling the Applicability of LbL Coatings for Drug Delivery in Dental Implant-Related Infection Treatment", "abstract": "Peri-implantitis is an inflammatory condition caused by bacterial biofilms adhered on dental implant surfaces that cause progressive tissue destruction from the host\u2019s inflammatory response.

Various chemical and physical techniques have been developed to remediate soils contaminated with organic pollutants, but challenges related to cost, efficacy, and toxic byproducts often limit their sustainability. Fortunately, phytoremediation, achieved through the use of plants and associated microbiomes, has shown great promise for tackling environmental pollution; this technology has been tested both in the laboratory and in the field. Plant\u2013microbe interactions further promote the efficacy of phytoremediation, with plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) often used to assist the remediation of organic pollutants. However, the efficiency of microbe-assisted phytoremediation can be impeded by (i) high concentrations of secondary toxins, (ii) the absence of a suitable sink for these toxins, (iii) nutrient limitations, (iv) the lack of continued release of microbial inocula, and (v) the lack of shelter or porous habitats for planktonic organisms.

However, the complex composition of multilayer packaging, involving bonded layers of different materials, presents substantial challenges for recycling, leading to low recycling rates and significant landfill accumulation. This study explores the potential of double packaging, which employs easily separable layers, as a solution to enhance recycling efficiency and mitigate environmental impacts. Primary recycling methods, including mechanical and chemical processes, are examined alongside advanced techniques like solvent-based and enzymatic recycling. Design considerations for double packaging are analyzed, emphasizing the use of minimal materials and adhesives, strategic sealing, and clear labeling to facilitate recyclability. Case studies from the food, beverage, and cosmetics sectors highlight the practical benefits of double packaging, demonstrating improvements in recycling rates, cost-effectiveness, and consumer compliance. The findings suggest that double packaging significantly simplifies the recycling process, reduces dependency on landfills, and lowers greenhouse gas emissions by decreasing the need for virgin materials. Effective implementation requires industry collaboration, regulatory support, economic incentives, investment in innovative recycling technologies, and robust consumer education programs. Double packaging emerges as a viable strategy for advancing sustainable packaging solutions and promoting a circular economy.\n\n", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-11-26", "synthetic_support_claim": "Double packaging significantly simplifies the recycling process, reduces landfill dependency, and lowers greenhouse gas emissions.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Single-layer packaging is inherently superior to double packaging in terms of overall environmental impact and sustainability."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "bf79894e331e9daadb0d186be1d69f731bc586a2", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bf79894e331e9daadb0d186be1d69f731bc586a2", "title": "Design, New Materials, and Production Challenges of Bioplastics-Based Food Packaging", "abstract": "This paper outlines the current design trends in food packaging, its main environmentally friendly material alternatives, and industrial processing technologies.

However, tetracycline has become a serious threat to the environment because of its overuse by humans and veterinarians and weak ability to degrade. Tetracycline is capable of accumulating along the food chain, causing toxicity to the microbial community, encouraging the development and spread of antibiotic resistance, creating threats to drinking and irrigation water, and disrupting microbial flora in the human intestine.

This term encompasses a wide range of techniques that promise to transform many areas of biology and eventually revolutionize pathology by measuring physical tissue structure and molecular characteristics at the same time. Although the field came of age in the past 5 years, it still suffers from some growing pains: barriers to entry, robustness, unclear best practices for experimental design and analysis, and lack of standardization. In this Review, we present a systematic catalog of the different families of spatial omics technologies; highlight their principles, power, and limitations; and give some perspective and suggestions on the biggest challenges that lay ahead in this incredibly powerful\u2014but still hard to navigate\u2014landscape. Description Editor\u2019s summary All of biology happens in space. In living organisms, cells must interact and assemble in three-dimensional tissues. The position of each cell is just as important as its intrinsic nature in determining how a tissue functions or malfunctions in a disease. Recently, many technologies have been invented to profile cells without removing them from their natural context, measuring gene expression and the regulatory landscape of a cell\u2019s genome alongside its spatial location within a tissue. In a review, Bressan et al. describe the features of these methods, collectively named spatial omics, and discuss what is missing for them to unlock their full potential. \u2014Stella M. Hurtley and Gemma Alderton A review discusses recent advances in methods for spatial omics. BACKGROUND Just as single-cell sequencing has revolutionized many fields of biology, spatial \u201comics,\u201d in which molecular parameters are measured in situ on intact tissue samples, is set to empower a new generation of scientific discoveries. A plethora of new technologies now enable spatial profiling of gene and protein expression, genetic mutations, epigenetic marks, chromatin structure, and genome organization. Most of these methods trace back to traditional techniques such as immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, or leverage the throughput of next-generation sequencing by converting spatial coordinates to sequence barcodes. Spatial omics technologies operate at vastly different levels of resolution, sensitivity, and throughput. There are also considerable differences in ease of adoption, compatibility with different sample types, commercial availability, upfront investment, and cost per sample. In such a rich and constantly evolving field, choosing the best technology to address a specific biological challenge\u2014carefully weighting the strengths and weaknesses of each\u2014is critical. ADVANCES The field of spatial molecular profiling has come of age over the past few years. Current RNA profiling technologies allow the spatial measurement of gene expression for centimeter-scale samples\u2014in many cases, at single-cell resolution. Targeted methods can quantify thousands of transcripts, including those of very low abundance, whereas untargeted protocols offer transcriptome-wide profiling and can even detect gene isoforms and mutations, with coverage approaching that of disaggregated single-cell methods. Multiplexed immunohistochemistry protocols, either based on mass spectrometry or fluorescence imaging, can similarly be used to profile tens to hundreds of protein markers on a wide range of samples. Recent studies have reported additional approaches that recover other types of molecular information, including the spatial profiling of genomic organization for thousands of loci, open chromatin and epigenetic marks, and untargeted in situ DNA sequencing. Multi-omic technologies capturing multiple sources of information at once are also becoming available. As these methods become more reliable and widely adopted, it is becoming increasingly clear that spatial omics will contribute substantially to the elucidation of many biological questions, with prominent examples in fields ranging from oncology (such as the study of tumor heterogeneity and microenvironment) to neuroscience and organismal development. OUTLOOK Future development trends in the spatial omic area are needed in three main areas: (i) multi-omics, which is defined as the simultaneous measurement of different parameters (for example, DNA, RNA, and protein); (ii) increased access and democratization, with technologies becoming more readily available, more reliable, and more robust; and (iii) improved analysis frameworks. As technologies continue to evolve, it will become necessary to dedicate more attention to data analysis and experimental design. Spatial omics technologies can already generate many terabytes of data in a single experiment, creating substantial challenges in data processing, analysis, and visualization. Statistical methods and guidelines for sample replication, study design, and batch correction are also lagging behind, although they\u2019re evolving rapidly. Last, as the future keeps getting closer, we foresee that spatial omics will likely evolve toward three-dimensional spatial omics (operating on whole organs or even organisms) and spatial-temporal omics (performing measurements multiple times in vivo), adding further powerful and exciting tools to biology\u2019s toolbox. Spatial omics methods profile the molecular make-up of tissues, preserving their spatial organization through four main steps. (A) Detection. Oligonucleotide probes or modified antibodies bind to specific nucleic acids, proteins, or small molecules. Alternatively, enzymatic processes can detect RNA (reverse transcription) or DNA (tagmentation) in an untargeted fashion. Single or multiple types of biomolecules can be profiled simultaneously. (B) Identification. Biomolecules can be identified directly with next-generation sequencing or mass spectrometry, or indirectly by means of an individual tag on the detection probe that is either read at once or sequentially (combinatorial barcode). (C) Measurement. Imaging-based methods measure the signal intensity of fluorescent probes or count the number of spots per area (single-molecule localization methods). Sequencing-based methods quantify the abundance of biomolecules through normalized read count or using unique molecular identifiers (UMIs). (D) Localization. Biomolecules are assigned to their spatial locations either directly in imaging-based methods, or by means of a DNA barcode decoded through sequencing. Technologies differ widely in terms of spatial resolution, sensitivity, and number and size of areas that can be profiled.", "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-08-04", "synthetic_support_claim": "Spatial omics simultaneously measures physical tissue structure and molecular characteristics, transforming biology and pathology.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Spatial omics has already achieved standardization in experimental design and analysis across different laboratories and studies."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "80de43cffa9a8e686961b9f2147bf3031da0b7f4", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/80de43cffa9a8e686961b9f2147bf3031da0b7f4", "title": "Transcriptome and Temporal Transcriptome Analyses in Single Cells", "abstract": "Transcriptome analysis in single cells, enabled by single-cell RNA sequencing, has become a prevalent approach in biomedical research, ranging from investigations of gene regulation to the characterization of tissue organization.

Schistosomiasis japonica is a unique species endemic to southern China, and schistosomiasis is characterized by severe liver injury, inflammation, liver granuloma, and subsequent liver fibrosis. However, the pathological mechanism of this disease remains unclear. Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a versatile technique that integrates the molecular specificity of mass spectrometry (MS) with spatial imaging information, which could provide an accurate method for observing disease progression. In this study, we used an air flow-assisted desorption electrospray ionization (AFADESI-MSI) platform to detect a wide range of metabolites and visualize their distribution in the liver tissue of mice infected with Schistosoma japonicum. In the negative ion mode analysis, 21 and 25 different metabolites were detected in the early and chronic stages of infection, respectively. Thirteen characteristic metabolites and 3 metabolic pathways related to disease development may be involved in the chronicity of schistosomiasis. There were more than 32 and 40 region-specific changes in the abundance of a wide range of metabolites (including carbohydrates, amino acids, nucleotides, and fatty acids) in the livers of mice at two different infection times, which also revealed the heterogeneous metabolic characteristics of the liver egg granulomas of S. japonicum. In a chronic infection model with S. japonicum, oral treatment with praziquantel significantly alleviated most metabolic disorders, including fatty acid and pyrimidine metabolism. Surprisingly, Upase1, a key enzyme in uridine metabolism, was significantly upregulated 6 weeks after infection, and liver uridine levels were negatively correlated with the abundance of multiple lipid-associated metabolites. Further studies revealed that in vitro uridine supplementation inhibited the activation of LX-2 cells, restored the homeostasis of fatty acid metabolism through the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) pathway, and played an antifibrotic role.

The use of Li-ion batteries has increased due to the rise of e-mobility in computers, cell phones, and electric vehicles. Recycling Li-ion batteries for raw material in lithium-ion battery production is increasingly important as the revolution unfolds. When disposing of, transporting, and recycling the battery, it is important to crush it to separate the black mass, plastic, and metal components. However, there is a potential explosion risk due to the remaining voltage in the battery. In recycling, the discharge step is significant. The research aimed to test a new method for discharging cylinder batteries using saltwater and an iron bed. Higher NaCl content increases pH and lowers electrochemical potential for water electrolysis. This unique combination enables the battery to discharge at a high rate. In 6 hours, the battery discharged in a 20 wt.% salt solution with 99.6% efficiency. The battery discharge efficiency decreased when exposed to 25 wt% and 30 wt% salt solutions, attributed to reduced water electrolysis intensity. According to the results of various experiments, it has been observed that as the temperature of the salt solution rises, there is a slight increase in the rate of battery discharge; however, no significant difference has been observed.

Conversational artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots can provide personalised health education and refer users for appropriate medical consultations. We aimed to explore design principles of a chatbot-assisted culturally sensitive self-assessment intervention based on the disclosure of health-related information. Methods In 2022, an online survey was conducted among an ethnically diverse UK sample (N = 1,287) to identify the level and type of health-related information disclosure to sexual health chatbots, and reactions to chatbots\u2019 risk appraisal. Follow-up interviews (N = 41) further explored perceptions of chatbot-led health assessment to identify aspects related to acceptability and utilisation. Datasets were analysed using one-way ANOVAs, linear regression, and thematic analysis. Results Participants had neutral-to-positive attitudes towards chatbots and were comfortable disclosing demographic and sensitive health information.

It is essential to note that overreliance or blind trust in ChatGPT, especially in high-stakes decision-making contexts, can have severe consequences. Similarly, lacking trust in the technology can lead to underuse, resulting in missed opportunities. Objective This study investigated the impact of users\u2019 trust in ChatGPT on their intent and actual use of the technology. Four hypotheses were tested: (1) users\u2019 intent to use ChatGPT increases with their trust in the technology; (2) the actual use of ChatGPT increases with users\u2019 intent to use the technology; (3) the actual use of ChatGPT increases with users\u2019 trust in the technology; and (4) users\u2019 intent to use ChatGPT can partially mediate the effect of trust in the technology on its actual use. Methods This study distributed a web-based survey to adults in the United States who actively use ChatGPT (version 3.5) at least once a month between February 2023 through March 2023. The survey responses were used to develop 2 latent constructs: Trust and Intent to Use, with Actual Use being the outcome variable. The study used partial least squares structural equation modeling to evaluate and test the structural model and hypotheses. Results In the study, 607 respondents completed the survey. The primary uses of ChatGPT were for information gathering (n=219, 36.1%), entertainment (n=203, 33.4%), and problem-solving (n=135, 22.2%), with a smaller number using it for health-related queries (n=44, 7.2%) and other activities (n=6, 1%). Our model explained 50.5% and 9.8% of the variance in Intent to Use and Actual Use, respectively, with path coefficients of 0.711 and 0.221 for Trust on Intent to Use and Actual Use, respectively. The bootstrapped results failed to reject all 4 null hypotheses, with Trust having a significant direct effect on both Intent to Use (\u03b2=0.711, 95% CI 0.656-0.764) and Actual Use (\u03b2=0.302, 95% CI 0.229-0.374). The indirect effect of Trust on Actual Use, partially mediated by Intent to Use, was also significant (\u03b2=0.113, 95% CI 0.001-0.227). Conclusions Our results suggest that trust is critical to users\u2019 adoption of ChatGPT. It remains crucial to highlight that ChatGPT was not initially designed for health care applications. Therefore, an overreliance on it for health-related advice could potentially lead to misinformation and subsequent health risks. Efforts must be focused on improving the ChatGPT\u2019s ability to distinguish between queries that it can safely handle and those that should be redirected to human experts (health care professionals).

In prespecified interim analyses, zanubrutinib was superior to ibrutinib with respect to overall response (the primary end point). Data from the final analysis of progression-free survival are now available.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, patients with relapsed or refractory CLL or SLL who had received at least one previous course of therapy to receive zanubrutinib or ibrutinib until the occurrence of disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects. In this final analysis, progression-free survival (a key secondary end point) was assessed with the use of a hierarchical testing strategy to determine whether zanubrutinib was noninferior to ibrutinib. If noninferiority was established, the superiority of zanubrutinib was assessed and claimed if the two-sided P value was less than 0.05.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt a median follow-up of 29.6 months, zanubrutinib was found to be superior to ibrutinib with respect to progression-free survival among 652 patients (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.65; 95% confidence interval, [CI], 0.49 to 0.86; P\u2009=\u20090.002), as assessed by the investigators; the results were similar to those as assessed by an independent-review committee. At 24 months, the investigator-assessed rates of progression-free survival were 78.4% in the zanubrutinib group and 65.9% in the ibrutinib group. Among patients with a 17p deletion, a TP53 mutation, or both, those who received zanubrutinib had longer progression-free survival than those who received ibrutinib (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.31 to 0.88); progression-free survival across other major subgroups consistently favored zanubrutinib. The percentage of patients with an overall response was higher in the zanubrutinib group than in the ibrutinib group.

Methods: A total of 53 individuals (20 female; mean age, 40.98 \u00b1 11.33) with a primary diagnosis of depression performed a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPX) to obtain maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max), maximal power output (Pmax), and the first and second ventilatory threshold (VT1, VT2) at the start and the end of the rehabilitation. Degree of depression was assessed by Becks Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Brief Symptom Inventory test (BSI). Overall activity was measured by accelerometer step-counts.

There is no current consensus regarding the most appropriate treatment for these patients.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn this open-label, phase 2 trial, we randomly assigned patients with resectable stage IIIA or IIIB NSCLC to receive neoadjuvant nivolumab plus platinum-based chemotherapy (experimental group) or chemotherapy alone (control group), followed by surgery. Patients in the experimental group who had R0 resections received adjuvant treatment with nivolumab for 6 months. The primary end point was a pathological complete response (0% viable tumor in resected lung and lymph nodes). Secondary end points included progression-free survival and overall survival at 24 months and safety.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 86 patients underwent randomization; 57 were assigned to the experimental group and 29 were assigned to the control group. A pathological complete response occurred in 37% of the patients in the experimental group and in 7% in the control group (relative risk, 5.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.34 to 21.23; P\u2009=\u20090.02). Surgery was performed in 93% of the patients in the experimental group and in 69% in the control group (relative risk, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.74).

We find that concentrations of circulating taurine decline with aging in mice, monkeys, and humans. A reversal of this decline through taurine supplementation increased the health span (the period of healthy living) and life span in mice and health span in monkeys. Mechanistically, taurine reduced cellular senescence, protected against telomerase deficiency, suppressed mitochondrial dysfunction, decreased DNA damage, and attenuated inflammaging. In humans, lower taurine concentrations correlated with several age-related diseases and taurine concentrations increased after acute endurance exercise.

Description Editor\u2019s summary Aging is associated with physiological changes that range in scale from organelles to organ systems, but we are still working to understand the molecular basis for these changes. Studying various animals, Singh et al. found that the amount of the semi-essential amino acid taurine in circulation decreased with age (see the Perspective by McGaunn and Baur). Supplementation with taurine slowed key markers of aging such as increased DNA damage, telomerase deficiency, impaired mitochondrial function, and cellular senescence. Loss of taurine in humans was associated with aging-related diseases, and concentrations of taurine and its metabolites increased in response to exercise. Taurine supplementation improved life span in mice and health span in monkeys. \u2014L. Bryan Ray Taurine supplementation extends healthy lifespan in worms, rodents, and non-human primates. INTRODUCTION Aging is an inevitable multifactorial process. Aging-related changes manifest as the \u201challmarks of aging,\u201d cause organ functions to decline, and increase the risk of disease and death. Aging is associated with systemic changes in the concentrations of molecules such as metabolites. However, whether such changes are merely the consequence of aging or whether these molecules are drivers of aging remains largely unexplored. If these were blood-based drivers of aging, then restoring their concentration or functions to \u201cyouthful\u201d levels could serve as an antiaging intervention. RATIONALE Taurine, a semiessential micronutrient, is one of the most abundant amino acids in humans and other eukaryotes. Earlier studies have shown that the concentration of taurine in blood correlates with health, but it is unknown whether blood taurine concentrations affect aging. To address this gap in knowledge, we measured the blood concentration of taurine during aging and investigated the effect of taurine supplementation on health span and life span in several species. RESULTS Blood concentration of taurine declines with age in mice, monkeys, and humans. To investigate whether this decline contributes to aging, we orally fed taurine or a control solution once daily to middle-aged wild-type female and male C57Bl/6J mice until the end of life. Taurine-fed mice of both sexes survived longer than the control mice. The median life span of taurine-treated mice increased by 10 to 12%, and life expectancy at 28 months increased by about 18 to 25%. A meaningful antiaging therapy should not only improve life span but also health span, the period of healthy living. We, therefore, investigated the health of taurine-fed middle-aged mice and found an improved functioning of bone, muscle, pancreas, brain, fat, gut, and immune system, indicating an overall increase in health span. We observed similar effects in monkeys. To check whether the observed effects of taurine transcended the species boundary, we investigated whether taurine supplementation increased life span in worms and yeast. Although taurine did not affect the replicative life span of unicellular yeast, it increased life span in multicellular worms. Investigations into the mechanism or mechanisms through which taurine supplementation improved the health span and life span revealed that taurine positively affected several hallmarks of aging. Taurine reduced cellular senescence, protected against telomerase deficiency, suppressed mitochondrial dysfunction, decreased DNA damage, and attenuated inflammation. An association analysis of metabolite clinical risk factors in humans showed that lower taurine, hypotaurine, and N-acetyltaurine concentrations were associated with adverse health, such as increased abdominal obesity, hypertension, inflammation, and prevalence of type 2 diabetes. Moreover, we found that a bout of exercise increased the concentrations of taurine metabolites in blood, which might partially underlie the antiaging effects of exercise. CONCLUSION Taurine abundance decreases during aging. A reversal of this decline through taurine supplementation increases health span and life span in mice and worms and health span in monkeys. This identifies taurine deficiency as a driver of aging in these species. To test whether taurine deficiency is a driver of aging in humans as well, long-term, well-controlled taurine supplementation trials that measure health span and life span as outcomes are required. Taurine deficiency as a driver of aging. Taurine concentration in blood declines with aging (top left). A reversal of this drop through taurine supplementation increased healthy life span in mice and worms but not in yeast (bottom left and top middle). Taurine supplementation affected several hallmarks of aging (middle). In humans, lower taurine concentrations were associated with multiple diseases (top right). A randomized controlled clinical trial in humans is warranted to assess the antiaging effects of taurine (bottom right).

Emerging evidence suggests that enhancing body's resistance to xenobiotics might be an anti-aging strategy. The constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) regulates drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters, coordinating metabolism and immune responses to adapt to stress triggered by exogenous exposure. However, the impact of activating CAR on aging remains unknown. In this study, Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), drug-induced premature aging mice, and senescence accelerated P8 (SAMP8) mice are used as models to explore the effects of CAR activation on lifespan and healthspan, along with the underlying mechanisms. The results showed that hCAR agonist CITCO and mCAR agonist TCPOBOP prolonged the lifespan and healthspan in model organism. The longevity effects of CITCO and TCPOBOP were attenuated in CAR homozygous nhr-8/daf-12 mutant C. elegans as well as CAR-/- mice. In C. elegans, CITCO activated both anti-stress and detoxification genes, and increased the resistance to environmental adversities.

In recent times, the term NAFLD has been modified to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), reflecting its comprehensive scope encompassing a range of metabolic abnormalities. Coriandrum sativum L. (CS) is a traditional medicine, although the preventive mechanism of CS extracts remains unclear. Objective: This study evaluated the preventive effects of CS in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced MASLD mice by oral administration of 100 or 200 mg/kg/day of CS extracts for 12 weeks. Results: The major CS extract compounds were chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, rutin, and isoquercetin. The administration of CS extract suppressed HFD-induced weight gain, liver weight, and the liver/body weight ratio. It improved the mice\u2019s serum biological profiles and suppressed HFD-induced lipid droplet and lipid accumulation by inhibiting lipid accumulation-related gene expression in the liver. It modulated HFD-induced Ampk-Srebp1c pathways and suppressed HFD-induced NF-\u03baB pathway activation in the liver.

Methods This cross-sectional, real-world retrospective study enrolled a total of 1118 obese patients in the department of bariatric surgery at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2021. Of these, 855 were enrolled in the study cohort. MAFLD was defined as the presence or absence of fatty liver disease as suggested by histologic biopsy of liver or postoperative pathology slides, or even hematology, and meets one of the following three conditions: overweight or obesity, T2DM, and metabolic dysfunction (MetS). Serum LDH activity levels were measured in 885 patients, and logistic regression was used to analyze the relationship between LDH and metabolic syndrome and the severity of MAFLD. Results In the study cohort of 855 obese patients, 604 (70.6%) had MetS. Patients with MetS (214.1[209.0\u2013219.2]) had significantly higher serum LDH levels than those without MetS (188.7[181.6\u2013195.9]). Particularly, serum LDH level was significantly higher in subjects with hypertension, central obesity, diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia, elevated levels of triglycerides, or reduced levels of high-density lipoprotein than in those without. Moreover, LDH concentrations were grouped according to the total number of MetS components present in each patient, with Serum LDH levels gradually increase with the total number of MetS components. The MASH subjects had significantly higher LDH levels than the other three less severe non-MASH cohorts, including normal liver, simple fatty steatosis, and B.MASH.

The International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) has been producing evidence\u2010based guidelines on the prevention and management of diabetes\u2010related foot disease since 1999. In 2023, all IWGDF Guidelines have been updated based on systematic reviews of the literature and formulation of recommendations by multidisciplinary experts from all over the world. In addition, a new guideline on acute Charcot neuro\u2010osteoarthropathy was created. In this document, the IWGDF Practical Guidelines, we describe the basic principles of prevention, classification and management of diabetes\u2010related foot disease based on the seven IWGDF Guidelines. We also describe the organisational levels to successfully prevent and treat diabetes\u2010related foot disease according to these principles and provide addenda to assist with foot screening. The information in these practical guidelines is aimed at the global community of healthcare professionals who are involved in the care of persons with diabetes. Many studies around the world support our belief that implementing these prevention and management principles is associated with a decrease in the frequency of diabetes\u2010related lower\u2010extremity amputations. The burden of foot disease and amputations is increasing at a rapid rate, and comparatively more so in middle to lower income countries.

Participants 50\u2009457 patients were invited to participate in the study, of whom 12\u2009053 (24%) responded and 11\u2009710 (58.8% (n=6881) female; mean age 44.1 years; 3.6% (412/11\u2009602) previously admitted with covid-19; mean follow-up time 8.5 months) could be included in the analyses. Main outcome measures Symptom frequencies (six to 12 months after versus before acute infection), symptom severity and clustering, risk factors, and associations with general health recovery and working capacity. Results The symptom clusters fatigue (37.2% (4213/11\u2009312), 95% confidence interval 36.4% to 38.1%) and neurocognitive impairment (31.3% (3561/11\u2009361), 30.5% to 32.2%) contributed most to reduced health recovery and working capacity, but chest symptoms, anxiety/depression, headache/dizziness, and pain syndromes were also prevalent and relevant for working capacity, with some differences according to sex and age. Considering new symptoms with at least moderate impairment of daily life and \u226480% recovered general health or working capacity, the overall estimate for post-covid syndrome was 28.5% (3289/11\u2009536, 27.7% to 29.3%) among participants or at least 6.5% (3289/50\u2009457) in the infected adult population (assuming that all non-responders had completely recovered).

Compared to the parental HPAIV H5N8 clade 2.3.4.4b, the novel reassortant HPAIV H5N1 displayed an increased ability to escape species barriers and infect multiple mammalian species, including humans. The virus host range has been recently expanded to include ruminants, particularly dairy cattle in the United States, where cattle-to-cattle transmission was reported. As with the avian 2.3.4.4.b H5N1 viruses, the cattle-infecting virus was found to transmit from cattle to other contact animals including cats, raccoons, rodents, opossums, and poultry. Although replication of the virus in cows appears to be mainly confined to the mammary tissue, with high levels of viral loads detected in milk, infected cats and poultry showed severe respiratory disease, neurologic signs, and eventually died. Furthermore, several human infections with HPAIV H5N1 have also been reported in dairy farm workers and were attributed to exposures to infected dairy cattle. This is believed to represent the first mammalian-to-human transmission report of the HPAIV H5N1. Fortunately, infection in humans and cows, as opposed to other animals, appears to be mild in most cases. Nevertheless, the H5N1 bovine outbreak represents the largest outbreak of the H5N1 in a domestic mammal close to humans, increasing the risk that this already mammalian adapted H5N1 further adapts to human-to-human transmission and starts a pandemic. Herein, we discuss the epidemiology, evolution, pathogenesis, and potential impact of the recently identified HPAIV H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b in dairy cattle in the United States.

Historically, liver biopsy has been the gold standard for assessing fibrosis, but limitations such as invasiveness, variability in results, and cost have spurred the development of non-invasive tests. Elastography techniques measure liver stiffness, providing important insights into fibrosis severity across various CLDs, including hepatitis B and C and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Ultrasound-based elastography techniques include vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE), point shear wave elastography, and 2D shear wave elastography. Most studies report high accuracy for diagnosing significant fibrosis and cirrhosis. While VCTE is the most widely used elastography method, each technique has strengths and limitations in different patient populations, affected by factors like alanine aminotransaminase levels, obesity, and presence of hepatic inflammation. Elastography proves valuable informations in treatment decisions for hepatitis B patients in the \"gray zone\" and helps identify high-risk groups requiring post-hepatitis C eradication surveillance. Recent studies emphasize the potential of elastography-based scores, such as the FibroScan-AST and AGILE scores, in improving diagnostic accuracy for patients with MASLD. However, diagnostic performance may vary by setting, requiring validation in primary care. Emerging precision medicine approaches, integrating genomics and novel biomarkers, promise to further enhance risk stratification in CLD management.

Methods: This document, developed as a consensus by an international group of experts affiliated with the World Association of Infectious Diseases and Immunological Disorders (WAidid), focuses on recent advancements in RSV prevention, highlighting the introduction of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and vaccines. Results: Historically, RSV treatment options were limited to supportive care and the monoclonal antibody palivizumab, which required multiple doses. Recent innovations have led to the development of long-acting mAbs, such as nirsevimab, which provide season-long protection with a single dose. Nirsevimab has shown high efficacy in preventing severe RSV-related lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in infants, reducing hospitalizations and ICU admissions. Additionally, new vaccines, such as RSVpreF and RSVpreF3, target older adults and have demonstrated significant efficacy in preventing LRTIs in clinical trials. Maternal vaccination strategies also show promise in providing passive immunity to newborns, protecting them during the most vulnerable early months of life. This document further discusses the global burden of RSV, its economic impact, and the challenges of implementing these preventative strategies in different healthcare settings. Conclusions: The evidence supports the integration of both passive (mAbs) and active (vaccines) immunization approaches as effective tools to mitigate the public health impact of RSV.

No failure to generate GD2-CART01 was observed. Three dose levels were tested (3-, 6-, and 10\u00d7106 CAR-positive T cells per kilogram of body weight) in the phase 1 portion of the trial, and no dose-limiting toxic effects were recorded; the recommended dose for the phase 2 portion of the trial was 10\u00d7106 CAR-positive T cells per kilogram.

Extraintestinal manifestations, such as primary sclerosing cholangitis, occur in approximately 27% of patients with UC. People with UC require monitoring of symptoms and biomarkers of inflammation (eg, fecal calprotectin), and require colonoscopy at 8 years from diagnosis for surveillance of dysplasia. Risk stratification by disease location (eg, Montreal Classification) and disease activity (eg, Mayo Score) can guide management of UC. First-line therapy for induction and maintenance of remission of mild to moderate UC is 5-aminosalicylic acid. Moderate to severe UC may require oral corticosteroids for induction of remission as a bridge to medications that sustain remission (biologic monoclonal antibodies against tumor necrosis factor [eg, infliximab], \u03b14\u03b27 integrins [vedolizumab], and interleukin [IL] 12 and IL-23 [ustekinumab]) and oral small molecules that inhibit janus kinase (eg, tofacitinib) or modulate sphingosine-1-phosphate (ozanimod).

An effective treatment for mild to moderate UC is 5-aminosalicylic acid, whereas moderate to severe UC can be treated with advanced therapies that target specific inflammation pathways, including monoclonal antibodies to tumor necrosis factor, \u03b14\u03b27 integrins, and IL-12 and IL-23 cytokines, as well as oral small molecule therapies targeting janus kinase or sphingosine-1-phosphate.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-09-12", "synthetic_support_claim": "Risk stratification by disease location and activity can effectively guide management of ulcerative colitis.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Dietary interventions can significantly reduce the need for medication in managing ulcerative colitis symptoms."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "6069f66a4731661f69397a54bed369a1bfb86db6", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6069f66a4731661f69397a54bed369a1bfb86db6", "title": "Identification of immune-associated genes for the diagnosis of ulcerative colitis-associated carcinogenesis via integrated bioinformatics analysis", "abstract": "Background UC patients suffer more from colorectal cancer (CRC) than the general population, which increases with disease duration. Early colonoscopy is difficult because ulcerative colitis-associated colorectal cancer (UCAC) lesions are flat and multifocal. Our study aimed to identify promising UCAC biomarkers that are complementary endoscopy strategies in the early stages. Methods The datasets may be accessed from the Gene Expression Omnibus and The Cancer Genome Atlas databases. The co-expressed modules of UC and CRC were determined via weighted co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). The biological mechanisms of the shared genes were exported for analysis using the Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. To identify protein interactions and hub genes, a protein-protein interaction network and CytoHubba analysis were conducted. To evaluate gene expression, external datasets and experimental validation of human colon tissues were utilized. The diagnostic value of core genes was examined through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Immune infiltration analysis was employed to investigate the associations between immune cell populations and hub genes. Results Three crucial modules were identified from the WGCNA of UC and CRC tissues, and 33 coexpressed genes that were predominantly enriched in the NF-\u03baB pathway were identified. Two biomarkers (CXCL1 and BCL6) were identified via Cytoscape and validated in external datasets and human colon tissues. CRC patients expressed CXCL1 at the highest level, whereas UC and CRC patients showed higher levels than the controls. The UC cohort expressed BCL6 at the highest level, whereas the UC and CRC cohorts expressed it more highly than the controls. The hub genes exhibited significant diagnostic potential (ROC curve > 0.7). The immune infiltration results revealed a correlation among the hub genes and macrophages, neutrophils and B cells. Conclusions The findings of our research suggest that BCL6 and CXCL1 could serve as effective biomarkers for UCAC surveillance.

This study aimed to clarify the effect of Met on UC, exploring its relationship with NLRP3 inflammasome and elucidating the potential mechanisms. Methods C57BL/6J mice were administrated with DSS solution to establish UC model. Disease Activity Index (DAI) and hematoxylin and eosin staining (HE) were performed to evaluate the impact of Met on UC model. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Reverse transcription - quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), Western blotting (WB), immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence were used to detect NLRP3 inflammasome activation in vivo. Furthermore, in vitro, bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) selected to clarify the role of Met on NLRP3 inflammasome activation and the underlying mechanisms. Results In vivo, Met could significantly inhibit the development of UC, characterized by decreased DAI, increased body weight and colorectal length, and the repair of damaged tissue. Met could also block macrophage infiltration and subsequently reduced the level of IL-1\u03b2, NLRP3, and Caspase-1 in the colorectal tissue, which were mainly expressed by macrophages. In addition, the level of IL-1\u03b2 in serum was remarkedly down-regulated by Met. In vitro, Met could inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation and subsequently dampen the maturation of pro-caspase-1 and pro-IL-1\u03b2. Moreover, Met could simultaneously suppress the activation of NF-\u03baB/p65 signaling pathway and disrupt the formation of ASC speck. At last, Met exhibited an anti-oxidant effect, along with upregulating the level of UCP2 and NCF1. Conclusion Met significantly ameliorated UC by inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages. The underlying mechanisms not only involved the inhibition of NF-\u03baB signaling pathway activation (first signal), but was also associated with up-regulation of UCP2 and NCF1 levels and thus the repression of ROS generation (second signal).", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-01", "synthetic_support_claim": "Met significantly ameliorated ulcerative colitis by inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Metformin directly targets and inhibits NF-\u03baB signaling in epithelial cells in ulcerative colitis."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "8797ff8839d0e57c964c3184d922acc5aaf5911b", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8797ff8839d0e57c964c3184d922acc5aaf5911b", "title": "Red Emissive Carbon Dot Superoxide Dismutase Nanozyme for Bioimaging and Ameliorating Acute Lung Injury", "abstract": "Harnessing the physiochemical properties and enzymatic activities of nanozymes will provide new insights for disease theranostics.

However, the structure\u2010activity relationship of CDs and their pharmacological mechanisms in disease treatment have yet to be comprehensively elucidated. In this study, two distinct types of CDs exhibiting superoxide dismutase (SOD)\u2010like enzymatic activities are synthesized through hydrothermal (Hy\u2010CDs) and carbonization (Ca\u2010CDs) methods, utilizing Honeysuckle as the common carbon material precursor. Through comparative analysis, surface group modifications, and theoretical calculations, it is determined that the SOD\u2010like enzymatic activity of CDs primarily originated from the stabilizing influence of the amino group on the superoxide (\u2022O2\u2212) intermediate and its conjugation to the \u03c0\u2010system, facilitating electron transfer.

Mucosal immunity within the respiratory tract includes tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells and tissue-resident memory B (BRM) cells, which provides rapid and efficient protection against RSV re-infection. Therefore, vaccine strategies should aim to generate mucosal immune responses. However, the interactions between RSV vaccines and mucosal immune responses within the respiratory tract are poorly understood. We evaluated a mucosal immune system following immunization by RSV vaccine with poly-sorbitol transporter (RSV-PST), a nanoparticle adjuvant. Methods: We intranasally immunized the RSV-PST and identified the systemic and mucosal immune responses. Furthermore, we challenged with RSV A2 strain after immunization and investigated the protective effects. Results: Consequently, antigen-specific CD8+ TRM cells were markedly elevated in the lung parenchyma, yet exhibited impaired cytokine expression. In contrast, humoral immunity, with systemic antibody production from serum, but not in the respiratory tract, was significantly increased by RSV-PST immunization. Interestingly, the production of respiratory mucosal antigen-specific IgG after RSV A2 challenge dramatically increased in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of the RSV-PST immunized group in the presence of FTY720, and the lung-infected RSV titer was significantly lower in this group.

Methods: A stated-preference survey elicited time trade-off (TTO) values from US adults in spring 2021 (n = 1014) and summer 2023 (n = 1186). Respondents were asked to indicate how much time they would hypothetically be willing to trade from the end of their life to avoid the effects of varying severities of COVID-19 and RSV illness for: (1) children; (2) parents of an ill child (family spillover); and (3) adults. Attitudes relating to COVID-19 vaccination and data on experience with COVID-19 or RSV illness were also collected. The primary outcome measure was the loss in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Changes in preferences over the time period from 2021 to 2023 were evaluated using regression analysis. Results: QALY losses increased with disease severity and were highest for Long COVID. Across all COVID-19 and RSV health states, QALY losses associated with child health states were higher than family spillover or adult health states.

Recent data from many worldwide reports suggest that most infections are caused by the Omicron variant and its sub-lineages, dominating all the previously emerged variants. The numerous mutations in Omicron\u2019s viral genome and its sub-lineages attribute it a larger amount of viral fitness, owing to the alteration of the transmission and pathophysiology of the virus. With a rapid change to the viral structure, Omicron and its sub-variants, namely BA.1, BA.2, BA.3, BA.4, and BA.5, dominate the community with an ability to escape the neutralization efficiency induced by prior vaccination or infections. Similarly, several recombinant sub-variants of Omicron, namely XBB, XBD, and XBF, etc., have emerged, which a better understanding. This review mainly entails the changes to Omicron and its sub-lineages due to it having a higher number of mutations. The binding affinity, cellular entry, disease severity, infection rates, and most importantly, the immune evading potential of them are discussed in this review. A comparative analysis of the Delta variant and the other dominating variants that evolved before Omicron gives the readers an in-depth understanding of the landscape of Omicron\u2019s transmission and infection. Furthermore, this review discusses the range of neutralization abilities possessed by several approved antiviral therapeutic molecules and neutralizing antibodies which are functional against Omicron and its sub-variants. The rapid evolution of the sub-variants is causing infections, but the broader aspect of their transmission and neutralization has not been explored. Thus, the scientific community should adopt an elucidative approach to obtain a clear idea about the recently emerged sub-variants, including the recombinant variants, so that effective neutralization with vaccines and drugs can be achieved.

To address this, vaccines have been adjusted to circulating variants. Despite intensive vaccination efforts, SARS-CoV-2 infections surged among KTRs during the Omicron wave, enabling a direct comparison of variant-specific immunity following-vaccination against Omicron BA.4/5 or Omicron infection in KTRs. Methods 98 SARS-CoV-2 na\u00efve KTRs who had received four vaccine doses were studied. Before and after a 5th antigen exposure, either via the bivalent vaccine composed of ancestral SARS-CoV-2 and Omicron BA.4/5 (29 KTRs) or via natural infection with Omicron (38 BA.4/5, 31 BA.1/2), spike-specific T cells were quantified using Elispot and serum pseudovirus neutralizing activity was assessed against the ancestral Wuhan strain, BA.5 and XBB.1.5. Results Compared to BA.4/5 vaccination, spike-specific T-cell responses and neutralization activity were higher up to six months post-Omicron infection and reached levels similar to healthy controls. Vaccinated KTRs showed modestly boosted neutralization activity against the Wuhan strain and BA.5, but not XBB.1.5. Baseline immunity correlated with immune responses three months post-vaccination and post-infection, indicating a predictive value for peak immune responses. Tixagevimab/Cilgavimab treatment was associated with robust neutralization of the Wuhan strain, but ineffective against XBB.1.5. Conclusion The BA.4/5 vaccine improved neutralizing activity against the BA.4/5 variant, but not against the subsequently circulating XBB.1.5 variant in KTRs. Conversely, omicron infection boosted T cells and humoral responses more effectively, showing efficacy against XBB.1.5.

We meta-analyzed SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence studies, standardized to those described in the World Health Organization\u2019s Unity protocol (WHO Unity) for general population seroepidemiological studies, to estimate the extent of population infection and seropositivity to the virus 2 years into the pandemic. Methods and findings We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, searching MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, preprints, and grey literature for SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence published between January 1, 2020 and May 20, 2022. The review protocol is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020183634). We included general population cross-sectional and cohort studies meeting an assay quality threshold (90% sensitivity, 97% specificity; exceptions for humanitarian settings). We excluded studies with an unclear or closed population sample frame. Eligible studies\u2014those aligned with the WHO Unity protocol\u2014were extracted and critically appraised in duplicate, with risk of bias evaluated using a modified Joanna Briggs Institute checklist. We meta-analyzed seroprevalence by country and month, pooling to estimate regional and global seroprevalence over time; compared seroprevalence from infection to confirmed cases to estimate underascertainment; meta-analyzed differences in seroprevalence between demographic subgroups such as age and sex; and identified national factors associated with seroprevalence using meta-regression. We identified 513 full texts reporting 965 distinct seroprevalence studies (41% low- and middle-income countries [LMICs]) sampling 5,346,069 participants between January 2020 and April 2022, including 459 low/moderate risk of bias studies with national/subnational scope in further analysis. By September 2021, global SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence from infection or vaccination was 59.2%, 95% CI [56.1% to 62.2%]. Overall seroprevalence rose steeply in 2021 due to infection in some regions (e.g., 26.6% [24.6 to 28.8] to 86.7% [84.6% to 88.5%] in Africa in December 2021) and vaccination and infection in others (e.g., 9.6% [8.3% to 11.0%] in June 2020 to 95.9% [92.6% to 97.8%] in December 2021, in European high-income countries [HICs]). After the emergence of Omicron in March 2022, infection-induced seroprevalence rose to 47.9% [41.0% to 54.9%] in Europe HIC and 33.7% [31.6% to 36.0%] in Americas HIC. In 2021 Quarter Three (July to September), median seroprevalence to cumulative incidence ratios ranged from around 2:1 in the Americas and Europe HICs to over 100:1 in Africa (LMICs). Children 0 to 9 years and adults 60+ were at lower risk of seropositivity than adults 20 to 29 (p < 0.001 and p = 0.005, respectively).

Setting The study was conducted across Cameroon\u2019s 10 regional capitals, between 2021 and 2022 as the country hosted a mass gathering. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional population-based survey in 2022, including SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence testing and retrospective mortality estimation using two-stage cluster sampling. We estimated and compared seroprevalence and crude mortality rates (CMR) to a survey conducted in 2021 using the same methodology. Results We performed serologic testing on 8400 individuals and collected mortality data from 22 314 individuals. Approximately 5% in each survey reported SARS-CoV-2-vaccination. Rapid diagnostic test-based seroprevalence increased from 11.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 10\u201312.5) to 59.8% (95% CI: 58.3\u201361.2) between 2021 and 2022, despite no increase in the proportion vaccinated. The CMR decreased from 0.17 to 0.06 deaths per 10 000 persons per day between 2021 and 2022. In 2022, no deaths were reportedly attributable to COVID-19 as compared to 17 deaths in 2021.

The primary objective of phase 1 was to assess safety and to identify the recommended dose for phase 2. In phase 2, patients received sotorasib at a dose of 960 mg orally once daily. The primary end point for phase 2 was a centrally confirmed objective response (defined as a complete or partial response). Efficacy end points were assessed in the pooled population from both phases and included objective response, duration of response, time to objective response, disease control (defined as an objective response or stable disease), progression-free survival, and overall survival. Safety was also assessed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe pooled population from phases 1 and 2 consisted of 38 patients, all of whom had metastatic disease at enrollment and had previously received chemotherapy. At baseline, patients had received a median of 2 lines (range, 1 to 8) of therapy previously. All 38 patients received sotorasib in the trial. A total of 8 patients had a centrally confirmed objective response (21%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 10 to 37).

While several government-funded organizations work towards consensus and standardization for testing and interpretation, compliance to these best practices remains inconsistent. Pharmacogenetic testing companies often develop proprietary practices for interpreting and reporting, which can lead to incongruency of reported results among companies and potential discrepancies in interpretation. Methods To identify the differences of commercial pharmacogenetic testing vendors\u2019 interpretation of genotype-to-phenotype translations and medication recommendations from the Clinical Pharmacogenetic Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines, a retrospective manual chart review was completed in a large rural healthcare system that utilizes two institution-approved pharmacogenetic vendors. One hundred patients were evaluated: 50 who completed testing through Company A and 50 who completed testing through Company B. Genes of interest for genotype-to-phenotype translation included CYP2B6, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. Comparison of medication recommendations for drug-gene pairs sertraline (CYP2B6 and/or CYP2C19), escitalopram (CYP2C19), and paroxetine (CYP2D6) were compared with recommendations from CPIC, with consideration of the CPIC Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor Antidepressants (SSRI) guideline 2023 update. This was accomplished via a novel binning process to enable comparison of company-provided binned medication recommendations with CPIC guideline recommendations. Briefly, the binning system included three categorizations based upon the relevant CPIC guideline recommendations\u2013no action needed (green), recommend monitoring (yellow) and therapeutic intervention or alternative recommended (red). Results There were 32/250 (12.8%) genotype-to-phenotype translation discrepancies from CPIC guidelines, all from Company A.

Discussion Significant differences were observed between testing companies\u2019 interpretations and recommendations, which is concerning as these discrepancies could lead to providers making medication decisions that are not supported by CPIC\u2019s clinical practice guidelines.

Here, we review links among climate, biodiversity, and society and develop a roadmap toward sustainability. These include limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and effectively conserving and restoring functional ecosystems on 30 to 50% of land, freshwater, and ocean \u201cscapes.\u201d We envision a mosaic of interconnected protected and shared spaces, including intensively used spaces, to strengthen self-sustaining biodiversity, the capacity of people and nature to adapt to and mitigate climate change, and nature\u2019s contributions to people. Fostering interlinked human, ecosystem, and planetary health for a livable future urgently requires bold implementation of transformative policy interventions through interconnected institutions, governance, and social systems from local to global levels. Description Facing coupled environmental crises Humanity is facing major social and ecological impacts from climate change and biodiversity loss. These two crises are intertwined, with common causes and effects on one another. P\u00f6rtner et al. review the results of a joint meeting of members of the International Panels on Climate Change and Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services. They discuss the connections between biodiversity loss and climate change and propose potential solutions for addressing them as interconnected problems. Drastic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, protection of multiuse landscapes and seascapes, and policies for providing equitable access to natural resources can help to ensure future ecological function and human well-being. \u2014BEL A Review presents a guide to addressing climate change and biodiversity loss as nonindependent crises. BACKGROUND Two intertwined crises threaten human well-being: Climate change\u2014arising from human-induced greenhouse gas emissions, including those from the loss of biomass and biodiversity\u2014is raising temperatures beyond those of the Holocene, when human civilization evolved and expanded globally. Mean warming and the increasing frequency and severity of extreme events in turn disturb ecosystem functioning, cause habitat loss to humans and biodiversity, and exacerbate the unprecedented loss of biodiversity already caused by human-induced habitat degradation, overexploitation of natural resources, and pollution. Both crises reduce nature\u2019s contributions to people, which sustain well-being, livelihoods, economies, and development prospects and also support climate change adaptation and mitigation. Failing to act will increase human vulnerability, including poverty, food insecurity, involuntary displacement, and political instability and conflict. The coupled global climate and biodiversity crises and their societal impacts concern land, freshwater, and ocean ecosystems alike but are insufficiently tackled by current actions, as identified by assessments of both the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) and IPBES (Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services). None of the 20 2011\u20132020 Aichi biodiversity targets and none of the mileposts on climate trajectories intended to limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C have been met. ADVANCES Climate, biodiversity, and societal challenges are intertwined but are often treated as singular problems. Solutions exist with cobenefits across sectors. In intact and functional ecosystems, nature is efficient at carbon capture (by photosynthesis) and sequestration (long-term removal from the carbon cycle), provided that warming is limited to 1.5\u00b0C or below through ambitious emissions reductions. Strengthening the biosphere on land, in freshwater, and in the ocean will support climate change mitigation, adaptation, biodiversity, human well-being, and livelihoods. Mounting scientific evidence points to the need to prioritize protection of remaining undamaged carbon- and species-rich environments and to implement targeted restoration projects, with more attention to effectively sustaining biodiversity and fairly distributed societal cobenefits. Three critical objectives for future spatial planning include a habitable climate, self-sustaining biodiversity, and sustained provisioning of nature\u2019s contributions to people to support development and a good quality of life for all. Coordinated efforts among science and policy can identify and help navigate development pathways toward climate resilience for both human society and biodiversity. OUTLOOK New global biodiversity, climate, and sustainability targets envisioned for 2030 and 2050 will likely fail if drivers behind climate change and biodiversity loss remain insufficiently addressed or concrete actions to meet current political agreements and goals do not increase in pace and scale. The following actions are urgently needed. (i) Ambitious emissions reduction, combined with suitable adaptation measures. (ii) Effective protection of an average of 30 to 50% of surface areas across a mosaic of interspersed and interconnected land, ocean, and freshwater \u201cscapes.\u201d These cover a gradient, from pristine ecosystems; to spaces shared by humans and wild species and sustainably used; to spaces under intensive uses such as cities, which nonetheless can harbor substantial biodiversity in terrestrial and aquatic spaces. Efforts need to consider the specific spatial demands for healthy ecosystems. (iii) Building of development pathways and the underpinning of political, economic, and social institutions (including norms and rules) on visions such as collective responsibility, sustainable and circular uses of natural resources, avoidance of overconsumption and waste, and more equitable and participatory development regionally and globally. (iv) The enabling of just and equitable access to and benefits from natural assets across societies, groups, and individuals, securing good quality of life. Transformative action can overcome siloed approaches through institutional and individual change, achieving sustainability for nature and people, as well as human, ecosystem, and planetary health. Climate, biodiversity, and human society are coupled through dynamic interactions across scales. Human-caused exploitation and climate change are increasingly threatening biodiversity and nature\u2019s contributions to people, causing losses and damages exemplified through overfished stocks and excessive drought that harm productive habitats.

Post hoc analysis of long-term efficacy and progression-free survival on next-line therapy (PFS2) is presented. METHODS Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to pembrolizumab, pembrolizumab-chemotherapy, or cetuximab-chemotherapy. Efficacy was evaluated in programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) combined positive score (CPS) \u2265 20, CPS \u2265 1, and total populations, with no multiplicity or alpha adjustment. RESULTS The median study follow-up was 45.0 months (interquartile range, 41.0-49.2; n = 882). At data cutoff (February 18, 2020), overall survival improved with pembrolizumab in the PD-L1 CPS \u2265 20 (hazard ratio [HR], 0.61; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.81) and CPS \u2265 1 populations (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.89) and was noninferior in the total population (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.68 to 0.97). Overall survival improved with pembrolizumab-chemotherapy in the PD-L1 CPS \u2265 20 (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.84), CPS \u2265 1 (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.78), and total (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.85) populations. The objective response rate on second-course pembrolizumab was 27.3% (3 of 11). PFS2 improved with pembrolizumab in the PD-L1 CPS \u2265 20 (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.84) and CPS \u2265 1 (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.66 to 0.95) populations and with pembrolizumab-chemotherapy in the PD-L1 CPS \u2265 20 (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.86), CPS \u2265 1 (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.55 to 0.81), and total (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.88) populations. PFS2 was similar after pembrolizumab and longer after pembrolizumab-chemotherapy on next-line taxanes and shorter after pembrolizumab and similar after pembrolizumab-chemotherapy on next-line nontaxanes. CONCLUSION With a 4-year follow-up, first-line pembrolizumab and pembrolizumab-chemotherapy continued to demonstrate survival benefit versus cetuximab-chemotherapy in recurrent/metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.

"abstract": "Importance\nHypertension, defined as persistent systolic blood pressure (SBP) at least 130 mm Hg or diastolic BP (DBP) at least 80 mm Hg, affects approximately 116 million adults in the US and more than 1 billion adults worldwide. Hypertension is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events (coronary heart disease, heart failure, and stroke) and death.\n\n\nObservations\nFirst-line therapy for hypertension is lifestyle modification, including weight loss, healthy dietary pattern that includes low sodium and high potassium intake, physical activity, and moderation or elimination of alcohol consumption. The BP-lowering effects of individual lifestyle components are partially additive and enhance the efficacy of pharmacologic therapy. The decision to initiate antihypertensive medication should be based on the level of BP and the presence of high atherosclerotic CVD risk. First-line drug therapy for hypertension consists of a thiazide or thiazidelike diuretic such as hydrochlorothiazide or chlorthalidone, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker such as enalapril or candesartan, and a calcium channel blocker such as amlodipine and should be titrated according to office and home SBP/DBP levels to achieve in most people an SBP/DBP target (<130/80 mm Hg for adults <65 years and SBP <130 mm Hg in adults \u226565 years). Randomized clinical trials have established the efficacy of BP lowering to reduce the risk of CVD morbidity and mortality. An SBP reduction of 10 mm Hg decreases risk of CVD events by approximately 20% to 30%.

Irbesartan, a potent angiotensin II receptor blocker, requires continuous safety monitoring. We conducted a disproportionality analysis of irbesartan-related adverse drug events (ADEs) using the FDA\u2019s FAERS and Japan\u2019s JADER databases. Methods We extracted irbesartan-related ADE reports from FAERS (Q1 2004 to Q1 2024) and JADER (Q2 2008 to Q4 2023). We used Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR), Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR), Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN), and Empirical Bayesian Geometric Mean (EBGM) for signal detection. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to exclude comorbid medications, and subgroup analyses by age and gender were performed to explore ADE occurrence in specific populations. Th time to onset (TTO) of ADEs was assessed using Weibull distribution test and Kaplan-Meier curves. Results A total of 5,816 (FAERS) and 366 (JADER) reports were analyzed, with irbesartan-related preferred terms (PTs) involving 27 System Organ Classes (SOCs) in FAERS and 22 in JADER. Three SOCs met detection thresholds in both databases: \u201cmetabolism and nutrition disorders,\u201d \u201ccardiac disorders,\u201d and \u201crenal and urinary disorders.\u201d We identified 219 positive signals in FAERS and 20 in JADER, including known signals like hyperkalemia, hypotension, and acute kidney injury. Notably, newly identified signals such as acute pancreatitis (n = 50, ROR: 7.76 [5.88\u201310.25]) and rhabdomyolysis (n = 50, ROR: 7.76 [5.88\u201310.25]) in FAERS and respiratory failure (n = 7, ROR: 6.76 [3.20\u201314.26]) in JADER could have significant clinical implications, as they may lead to severe outcomes if not recognized and managed promptly. Subgroup analyses revealed both similarities and differences in signal detection across gender and age groups. Sensitivity analyses, excluding concomitant medications, confirmed the persistence of key positive signals, including hyperkalemia, angioedema, acute pancreatitis, and agranulocytosis. ADEs mainly occurred within 1 month (34.14%) and after 1 year (32.32%) after dosing, with a median onset of 107 days. Conclusion This study provides valuable real-world evidence on the safety profile of irbesartan. The identification of new safety signals underscores the necessity of updating drug labels, particularly for assessing and managing high-risk patients.

The present study aimed to longitudinally investigate the association of carotid intima-media thickness [CIMT) progression and cardiovascular risk factors in the T2DM and non-DM rural black population of South Africa. Methods: This population-based retrospective cohort study was conducted in the Dikgale Mamabolo Mothiba Surveillance area between 2014 and 2023 by the Africa Wits INDEPTH Partnership for Genomic Research (AWI-Gen). The IBM Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 27 was used to analyze data. The paired T-test was used to determine the mean differences between baseline and follow-up.

The aim of this systematic analysis is to present the most comprehensive and up-to-date estimates of disease burden, epidemiological trends, and attributable risk factors of neurological disorders at global, regional, and national levels. Methods We extracted data of 18 neurological disorders from the Global Burden of Disease 2019 study database. The burden of neurological disorders was measured using the incidence, prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and further described according to age, sex, year, geographical location and socio-demographic Index (SDI). All estimates were presented with corresponding 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). Findings Globally, in 2019, there were nearly 10 million deaths and 349 million DALYs due to neurological disorders. Among the 18 neurological disorders, stroke was the biggest contributor to DALYs (143232.18 [95%UI 133095.81-153241.82] in thousands) and deaths (6552.72 [95%UI 5995.20-7015.14] in thousands), followed by neonatal encephalopathy due to birth asphyxia and trauma. From 1990 to 2019, the DALYs of neurological diseases belonging to the communicable, maternal, neonatal and nutritional categories showed a sharp decrease, while Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and Parkinson's disease showed a large increase. Neurological disorders exhibited different profiles in different regions and age groups. A significant correlation between the SDI and the age-standardized DALY rates was also found except for Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. In addition, risk factors such as high systolic blood pressure, low birth weight and short gestation period, and metabolic risk contribute significantly to neurological disorders.

Selected chatbots were tested, answering 50 USMLE-style MCQs. The questions were randomly selected from the Gross Anatomy course exam database for medical students and reviewed by three independent experts. The results of five successive attempts to answer each set of questions by the chatbots were evaluated in terms of accuracy, relevance, and comprehensiveness.

Typically, children and adolescents with ADHD find it difficult to pay attention and they are hyperactive and impulsive. Methylphenidate is the psychostimulant most often prescribed, but the evidence on benefits and harms is uncertain. This is an update of our comprehensive systematic review on benefits and harms published in 2015.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo assess the beneficial and harmful effects of methylphenidate for children and adolescents with ADHD.\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nWe searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases and two trials registers up to March 2022. In addition, we checked reference lists and requested published and unpublished data from manufacturers of methylphenidate.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nWe included all randomised clinical trials (RCTs) comparing methylphenidate versus placebo or no intervention in children and adolescents aged 18 years and younger with a diagnosis of ADHD. The search was not limited by publication year or language, but trial inclusion required that 75% or more of participants had a normal intellectual quotient (IQ > 70). We assessed two primary outcomes, ADHD symptoms and serious adverse events, and three secondary outcomes, adverse events considered non-serious, general behaviour, and quality of life.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nTwo review authors independently conducted data extraction and risk of bias assessment for each trial. Six review authors including two review authors from the original publication participated in the update in 2022. We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Data from parallel-group trials and first-period data from cross-over trials formed the basis of our primary analyses. We undertook separate analyses using end-of-last period data from cross-over trials. We used Trial Sequential Analyses (TSA) to control for type I (5%) and type II (20%) errors, and we assessed and downgraded evidence according to the GRADE approach.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nWe included 212 trials (16,302 participants randomised); 55 parallel-group trials (8104 participants randomised), and 156 cross-over trials (8033 participants randomised) as well as one trial with a parallel phase (114 participants randomised) and a cross-over phase (165 participants randomised). The mean age of participants was 9.8 years ranging from 3 to 18 years (two trials from 3 to 21 years). The male-female ratio was 3:1. Most trials were carried out in high-income countries, and 86/212 included trials (41%) were funded or partly funded by the pharmaceutical industry. Methylphenidate treatment duration ranged from 1 to 425 days, with a mean duration of 28.8 days. Trials compared methylphenidate with placebo (200 trials) and with no intervention (12 trials). Only 165/212 trials included usable data on one or more outcomes from 14,271 participants. Of the 212 trials, we assessed 191 at high risk of bias and 21 at low risk of bias. If, however, deblinding of methylphenidate due to typical adverse events is considered, then all 212 trials were at high risk of bias.\n\n\nPRIMARY OUTCOMES\nmethylphenidate versus placebo or no intervention may improve teacher-rated ADHD symptoms (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.88 to -0.61; I\u00b2 = 38%; 21 trials; 1728 participants; very low-certainty evidence). This corresponds to a mean difference (MD) of -10.58 (95% CI -12.58 to -8.72) on the ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS; range 0 to 72 points). The minimal clinically relevant difference is considered to be a change of 6.6 points on the ADHD-RS. Methylphenidate may not affect serious adverse events (risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.67; I\u00b2 = 0%; 26 trials, 3673 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The TSA-adjusted intervention effect was RR 0.91 (CI 0.31 to 2.68).\n\n\nSECONDARY OUTCOMES\nmethylphenidate may cause more adverse events considered non-serious versus placebo or no intervention (RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.37; I\u00b2 = 72%; 35 trials 5342 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The TSA-adjusted intervention effect was RR 1.22 (CI 1.08 to 1.43). Methylphenidate may improve teacher-rated general behaviour versus placebo (SMD -0.62, 95% CI -0.91 to -0.33; I\u00b2 = 68%; 7 trials 792 participants; very low-certainty evidence), but may not affect quality of life (SMD 0.40, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.83; I\u00b2 = 81%; 4 trials, 608 participants; very low-certainty evidence).\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nThe majority of our conclusions from the 2015 version of this review still apply. Our updated meta-analyses suggest that methylphenidate versus placebo or no-intervention may improve teacher-rated ADHD symptoms and general behaviour in children and adolescents with ADHD. There may be no effects on serious adverse events and quality of life. Methylphenidate may be associated with an increased risk of adverse events considered non-serious, such as sleep problems and decreased appetite. However, the certainty of the evidence for all outcomes is very low and therefore the true magnitude of effects remain unclear. Due to the frequency of non-serious adverse events associated with methylphenidate, the blinding of participants and outcome assessors is particularly challenging. To accommodate this challenge, an active placebo should be sought and utilised. It may be difficult to find such a drug, but identifying a substance that could mimic the easily recognised adverse effects of methylphenidate would avert the unblinding that detrimentally affects current randomised trials. Future systematic reviews should investigate the subgroups of patients with ADHD that may benefit most and least from methylphenidate. This could be done with individual participant data to investigate predictors and modifiers like age, comorbidity, and ADHD subtypes.", "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-03-27", "synthetic_support_claim": "Methylphenidate may improve teacher-rated ADHD symptoms and general behaviour but likely increases non-serious adverse events.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "\"Methylphenidate significantly enhances academic performance in children and adolescents with ADHD over extended periods.\""}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "0dca4b352fe2990e9f74d3913e1306da550f2381", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0dca4b352fe2990e9f74d3913e1306da550f2381", "title": "Differential Impact of Serotonin Signaling Methylphenidate on Young versus Adult: Insights from Behavioral and Dorsal Raphe Nucleus Neuronal Recordings from Freely Behaving Rats", "abstract": "Methylphenidate (MPD) remains a cornerstone pharmacological intervention for managing ADHD, yet its increasing usage among ordinary youth and adults outside clinical contexts necessitates a thorough investigation into its developmental effects.

The disorder negatively influences their academic performance and social relations, and their quality of life (QoL) is lower than that of peers without ADHD. The majority of children and adolescents with ADHD are treated with medication that potentially has an insufficient effect or frequently occurring adverse events. Physical activity is thought to alter the physiology of ADHD by affecting the same catecholaminergic system in the brain which is targeted by medication. Methods and analysis This protocol is written in accordance with the \u2018Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols\u2019 guideline. Randomised clinical trials with participating children and adolescents between the ages of 3 and 18 years with a primary diagnosis of ADHD or hyperkinetic disorder will be included in the systematic review. The main objective of the review is to examine the effect of physical activity on QoL, executive functions, symptoms and functional impairment in this population. Previous systematic reviews on the effect of physical activity in children and adolescents with ADHD have several methodological and conceptual limitations. These reviews, for example, included both randomised and non-randomised clinical trials or had restrictions regarding the frequency and intensity of the physical activity interventions they included. The present review will include the newest studies in the field and follow the main principles outlined in the \u2018Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions\u2019. Furthermore, it will be the first review in the field to include QoL as an outcome and to apply trial sequential analysis as part of the meta-analysis. Ethics and dissemination As the systematic review is a secondary analysis of data from primary trials, approval from an ethics committee is not required. The results of the review will be published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal and presented at relevant conferences.

This selection helped to improve the formulation by allowing us to refine key characteristics such as particle size, entrapment efficiency, and polydispersity index (PDI). The optimized EFV-NLCs had a mean particle size of 91.41 \u00b1 7.90 nm, a PDI of 0.28 \u00b1 0.04, a zeta potential of -17 mV, an entrapment efficiency of 85 \u00b1 7%, and a drug loading of 14 \u00b1 1%.

Particularly, several database resources are newly developed for infectious diseases and microbiology (MPoxVR, KGCoV, ProPan), cancer-trait association (ASCancer Atlas, TWAS Atlas, Brain Catalog, CCAS) as well as tropical plants (TCOD). Importantly, given the global health threat caused by monkeypox virus and SARS-CoV-2, CNCB-NGDC has newly constructed the monkeypox virus resource, along with frequent updates of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, variants as well as haplotypes.

Design Nationwide register based emulated target trial. Setting Swedish national registries. Participants 919\u2009614 women aged 50-58 between 2007 and 2020 without hormone therapy use in the previous two years, identified from the Swedish population. Interventions 138 nested trials were designed, starting each month from July 2007 until December 2018. Using the prescription registry data for that specific month, women who had not used hormone therapy in the previous two years were assigned to one of eight treatment groups: oral combined continuous, oral combined sequential, oral unopposed oestrogen, oral oestrogen with local progestin, tibolone, transdermal combined, transdermal unopposed oestrogen, or non-initiators of menopausal hormone therapy. Main outcome measures Hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals were estimated for venous thromboembolism, as well as for ischaemic heart disease, cerebral infarction, and myocardial infarction separately and as a composite cardiovascular disease outcome. Treatment effects were estimated by contrasting initiators and non-initiators in observational analogues to \u201cintention-to-treat\u201d analyses and continuous users versus never users in \u201cper protocol\u201d analyses. Results A total of 77\u2009512 women were initiators of any menopausal hormone therapy and 842\u2009102 women were non-initiators. 24\u2009089 women had an event recorded during the follow-up: 10\u2009360 (43.0%) had an ischaemic heart disease event, 4098 (17.0%) had a cerebral infarction event, 4312 (17.9%) had a myocardial infarction event, and 9196 (38.2%) had a venous thromboembolic event. In intention-to-treat analyses, tibolone was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (hazard ratio 1.52, 95% confidence interval 1.11 to 2.08) compared with non-initiators. Initiators of tibolone or oral oestrogen-progestin therapy had a higher risk of ischaemic heart disease (1.46 (1.00 to 2.14) and 1.21 (1.00 to 1.46), respectively). A higher risk of venous thromboembolism was observed for oral continuous oestrogen-progestin therapy (1.61, 1.35 to 1.92), sequential therapy (2.00, 1.61 to 2.49), and oestrogen-only therapy (1.57, 1.02 to 2.44).

The prevalence of such observational data and the difficulty for randomized controlled trials (RCT) to cover all population/treatment relationships make these methods increasingly attractive for studying causal effects. However, researchers should be wary of many pitfalls. We propose and illustrate a framework for causal inference estimating the effect of albumin on mortality in sepsis using an Intensive Care database (MIMIC-IV) and comparing various sensitivity analyses to results from RCTs as gold-standard. The first step is study design, using the target trial concept and the PICOT framework: Population (patients with sepsis), Intervention (combination of crystalloids and albumin for fluid resuscitation), Control (crystalloids only), Outcome (28-day mortality), Time (intervention start within 24h of admission). We show that too large treatment-initiation times induce immortal time bias. The second step is selection of the confounding variables based on expert knowledge. Increasingly adding confounders enables to recover the RCT results from observational data. As the third step, we assess the influence of multiple models with varying assumptions, showing that a doubly robust estimator (AIPW) with random forests proved to be the most reliable estimator. Results show that these steps are all important for valid causal estimates. A valid causal model can then be used to individualize decision making: subgroup analyses showed that treatment efficacy of albumin was better for patients >60 years old, males, and patients with septic shock. Without causal thinking, machine learning is not enough for optimal clinical decision on an individual patient level. Our step-by-step analytic framework helps avoiding many pitfalls of applying machine learning to EHR data, building models that avoid shortcuts and extract the best decision-making evidence.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-01", "synthetic_support_claim": "Too large treatment-initiation times induce immortal time bias in estimating the effect of albumin.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Machine learning without causal thinking can completely substitute randomized controlled trials for clinical decision-making."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "f7dda3cd6a26f514f367f2280fe6844f5e5c8a2f", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f7dda3cd6a26f514f367f2280fe6844f5e5c8a2f", "title": "Bias in artificial intelligence algorithms and recommendations for mitigation", "abstract": "The adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms is rapidly increasing in healthcare.

It is vital to limit the progression of DR disease in order to prevent the loss of vision in diabetic patients. It is therefore essential that DR disease is diagnosed at an early phase. Thanks to retinal screening at least twice a year, DR disease can be diagnosed in its early phases. However, due to the variations and complexity of DR, it is really difficult to determine the phase of DR disease in current clinical diagnoses. This paper presents a robust artificial intelligence (AI)-based model that can overcome nonlinear dynamics with low computational complexity and high classification accuracy using fundus images to determine the phase of DR disease. The proposed model consists of four stages, excluding the preprocessing stage. In the preprocessing stage, fractal analysis is performed to reveal the presence of chaos in the dataset consisting of 12,500 color fundus images. In the first stage, two-dimensional stationary wavelet transform (2D-SWT) is applied to the dataset consisting of color fundus images in order to prevent information loss in the images and to reveal their characteristic features. In the second stage, 96 features are extracted by applying statistical- and entropy-based feature functions to approximate, horizontal, vertical, and diagonal matrices of 2D-SWT. In the third stage, the features that keep the classifier performance high are selected by a chaotic-based wrapper approach consisting of the k-nearest neighbor (kNN) and chaotic particle swarm optimization algorithms (CPSO) to cope with both chaoticity and computational complexity in the fundus images. At the last stage, an AI-based classification model is created with the recurrent neural network-long short-term memory (RNN-LSTM) architecture by selecting the lowest number of feature sets that can keep the classification performance high. The performance of the DR disease classification model was tested on 2500 color fundus image data, which included five classes: no DR, mild non-proliferative DR (NPDR), moderate NPDR, severe NPDR, and proliferative DR (PDR). The robustness of the DR disease classification model was confirmed by the 10-fold cross-validation. In addition, the classification performance of the proposed model is compared with the support vector machine (SVM), which is one of the machine learning techniques. The results obtained show that the proposed model can overcome nonlinear dynamics in color fundus images with low computational complexity and is very effective and successful in precisely diagnosing all phases of DR disease.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-08-03", "synthetic_support_claim": "The proposed AI model effectively diagnoses all phases of diabetic retinopathy with high classification accuracy.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "The AI-based model can also effectively detect other eye diseases like glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "e4dd445f588b22931837badd36942d562137e12a", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e4dd445f588b22931837badd36942d562137e12a", "title": "Kernel random forest with black hole optimization for heart diseases prediction using data fusion", "abstract": "In recent years, the Internet of Things has played a dominant role in various real-time problems and given solutions via sensor signals.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists are useful treatment options for MASLD; however, the efficacy of oral semaglutide in treating liver steatosis/fibrosis has not been fully elucidated. Methods: A secondary analysis of a multicenter, retrospective, observational study investigating the efficacy and safety of oral semaglutide in Japanese subjects with type 2 diabetes in a real-world clinical setting (the Sapporo-Oral SEMA study) was conducted. Subjects in the original cohort were divided into groups as follows: subjects with suspected MASLD (alanine aminotransferase > 30 U/L) were placed in an overall group; a subpopulation from an overall group at high risk for hepatic fibrosis (fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index \u2265 1.3 or platelet count < 200,000/\u00b5L) was placed in a high-risk group; and the remaining subjects were placed in a low-risk group. Changes in the hepatic steatosis index and FIB-4 index after oral semaglutide induction were explored using a paired t-test or the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Results: Overall, 169 subjects (including 131 that switched from other medications) were analyzed, and 67 and 102 subjects were selected for the high-risk and low-risk groups, respectively. Oral semaglutide significantly improved the hepatic steatosis index (from 46.1 to 44.6, p < 0.001) and FIB-4 index (from 1.04 to 0.96, p < 0.001) as well as several metabolic parameters in all cohorts. The efficacy of semaglutide in treating liver fibrosis was confirmed by the addition of, and switching from, existing agent groups. Furthermore, improvement in the FIB-4 index was significantly negatively correlated with the baseline FIB-4 index.

We aimed to investigate whether HER2\u2010low impacts the prognosis of early\u2010stage breast cancer overall and in specific subgroups, explore differences in clinicopathologic markers, and examine the role of age in HER2\u2010low prognostic stratification. Materials & Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of 6920 HER2\u2010negative breast cancer patients from the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University (2010\u20132022). The study focused on the impact of HER2\u2010low status (immunohistochemistry +1 or +2, in situ hybridization not amplified) on overall survival (OS), considering the age at diagnosis. Results Generally, HER2\u2010low status correlated with less aggressive cancer indicators. No significant prognostic differences were observed between HER2\u2010low and HER2\u20100 in the entire cohort, HR\u2010positive, and HR\u2010negative groups. However, in TNBC patients aged \u2265\u200965, HER2\u2010low correlated with significantly better OS (HR\u2009=\u20090.45, 95% CI 0.24\u20130.83, p\u2009=\u20090.011), a finding consistent after multivariable adjustment (HR\u2009=\u20090.34, 95% CI 0.14\u20130.80, p\u2009=\u20090.014). In other subgroups, prognosis did not significantly correlate with HER2 status. The combination of HER2\u2010low status and age plays a key role in prognostic stratification in TNBC. Patients aged \u2265\u200965 with HER2\u20100 had considerably poorer prognoses compared to other subgroups. Conclusion This extensive retrospective study demonstrates that HER2\u2010low status cannot serve as an independent prognostic factor in the entire cohort, nor in the HR\u2010positive and HR\u2010negative groups individually.

AHREs resemble atrial fibrillation but are rare and brief. Whether the occurrence of AHREs in patients without atrial fibrillation (as documented on a conventional electrocardiogram [ECG]) justifies the initiation of anticoagulants is not known.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted an event-driven, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized trial involving patients 65 years of age or older who had AHREs lasting for at least 6 minutes and who had at least one additional risk factor for stroke. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive edoxaban or placebo. The primary efficacy outcome was a composite of cardiovascular death, stroke, or systemic embolism, evaluated in a time-to-event analysis. The safety outcome was a composite of death from any cause or major bleeding.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe analysis population consisted of 2536 patients (1270 in the edoxaban group and 1266 in the placebo group). The mean age was 78 years, 37.4% were women, and the median duration of AHREs was 2.8 hours. The trial was terminated early, at a median follow-up of 21 months, on the basis of safety concerns and the results of an independent, informal assessment of futility for the efficacy of edoxaban; at termination, the planned enrollment had been completed. A primary efficacy outcome event occurred in 83 patients (3.2% per patient-year) in the edoxaban group and in 101 patients (4.0% per patient-year) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.60 to 1.08; P\u2009=\u20090.15). The incidence of stroke was approximately 1% per patient-year in both groups. A safety outcome event occurred in 149 patients (5.9% per patient-year) in the edoxaban group and in 114 patients (4.5% per patient-year) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.67; P\u2009=\u20090.03).

In turn, those receptors are the start of a cytoplasmic signaling pathway where balance is key to effective healing and, as needed, cell and matrix regeneration. When directed through NF-\u03baB, these signaling routes lead to transient responses to the benefit of initiating immune cell recruitment, cell replication, local chemokine and cytokine production, and matrix protein synthesis. The converse can also occur, where ongoing canonical NF-\u03baB activation leads to chronic, hyper-responsive states. Here, we assess three key players, TAK1, TNFAIP3, and TNIP1, in cytoplasmic regulation of NF-\u03baB activation, which, because of their distinctive and yet inter-related functions, either promote or limit that activation. Their balanced function is integral to successful wound healing, given their significant control over the expression of inflammation-, fibrosis-, and matrix remodeling-associated genes. Intriguingly, these three proteins have also been emphasized in dysregulated NF-\u03baB signaling central to systemic sclerosis (SSc). Notably, diffuse SSc shares some tissue features similar to an excessive inflammatory/fibrotic wound response without eventual resolution. Taking a cue from certain instances of aberrant wound healing and SSc having some shared aspects, e.g., chronic inflammation and fibrosis, this review looks for the first time, to our knowledge, at what those pathologies might have in common regarding the cytoplasmic progression of NF-\u03baB-mediated signaling. Additionally, while TAK1, TNFAIP3, and TNIP1 are often investigated and reported on individually, we propose them here as three proteins whose consequences of function are very highly interconnected at the signaling focus of NF-\u03baB. We thus highlight the emerging promise for the eventual clinical benefit derived from an improved understanding of these integral signal progression modulators. Depending on the protein, its indirect or direct pharmacological regulation has been reported. Current findings support further intensive studies of these points in NF-\u03baB regulation both for their basic function in healthy cells as well as with the goal of targeting them for translational benefit in multiple cutaneous wound healing situations, whether stemming from acute injury or a dysregulated inflammatory/fibrotic response.", "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-11-28", "synthetic_support_claim": "Three key proteins, TAK1, TNFAIP3, and TNIP1, significantly regulate NF-\u03baB activation in wound healing.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Direct NF-\u03baB inhibition uniformly enhances wound healing outcomes across all types of cutaneous injuries."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "458bf5f19f73d425a88570789685be239bdcce6f", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/458bf5f19f73d425a88570789685be239bdcce6f", "title": "New Perspectives of Hydrogels in Chronic Wound Management", "abstract": "Chronic wounds pose a substantial healthcare concern due to their prevalence and cost burden.

The ECMO-CS trial (Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation in the Therapy of Cardiogenic Shock) aimed to compare immediate implementation of VA-ECMO versus an initially conservative therapy (allowing downstream use of VA-ECMO) in patients with rapidly deteriorating or severe cardiogenic shock. Methods: This multicenter, randomized, investigator-initiated, academic clinical trial included patients with either rapidly deteriorating or severe cardiogenic shock. Patients were randomly assigned to immediate VA-ECMO or no immediate VA-ECMO. Other diagnostic and therapeutic procedures were performed as per current standards of care. In the early conservative group, VA-ECMO could be used downstream in case of worsening hemodynamic status. The primary end point was the composite of death from any cause, resuscitated circulatory arrest, and implementation of another mechanical circulatory support device at 30 days. Results: A total of 122 patients were randomized; after excluding 5 patients because of the absence of informed consent, 117 subjects were included in the analysis, of whom 58 were randomized to immediate VA-ECMO and 59 to no immediate VA-ECMO. The composite primary end point occurred in 37 (63.8%) and 42 (71.2%) patients in the immediate VA-ECMO and the no early VA-ECMO groups, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.46\u20131.12]; P=0.21).

The aim of our narrative review is to summarize the existing evidence and provide a deep examination of the diagnosis and treatment of acute ischemic stroke patients undergoing ECMO support. The incidence rate of ISs is estimated to be between 1 and 8%, while the mortality rate ranges from 44 to 76%, depending on several factors, including ECMO type, duration of support and patient characteristics. Several mechanisms leading to ISs during ECMO have been identified, with thromboembolic events and cerebral hypoperfusion being the most common causes. However, considering that most of the ECMO patients are severely ill or under sedation, stroke symptoms are often underdiagnosed. Multimodal monitoring and daily clinical assessment could be useful preventive techniques. Early recognition of neurological deficits is of paramount importance for prompt therapeutic interventions. All ECMO patients with suspected strokes should immediately receive brain computed tomography (CT) and CT angiography (CTA) for the identification of large vessel occlusion (LVO) and assessment of collateral blood flow. CT perfusion (CTP) can further assist in the detection of viable tissue (penumbra), especially in cases of strokes of unknown onset. Catheter angiography is required to confirm LVO detected on CTA. Intravenous thrombolytic therapy is usually contraindicated in ECMO as most patients are on active anticoagulation treatment. Therefore, mechanical thrombectomy is the preferred treatment option in cases where there is evidence of LVO. The choice of the arterial vascular access used to perform mechanical thrombectomy should be discussed between interventional radiologists and an ECMO team.

In a previous study in patients with mild VCI and cerebral small vessels disease, a hemodynamic pattern of cerebral hypoperfusion and enhanced vascular resistance were observed; however, longitudinal data are currently lacking. Here, we perform a clinical, psychopathological, and neurosonological follow-up of patients with VCI in order to monitor any progression and to identify TCD measures to detect it. Methods From the original cohort of 161 patients, 127 with VCI (mean age 73.6 \u00b1 7.1; 67 males) were re-evaluated after 5.0 \u00b1 1.8 years. Namely, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), the 17-items Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), and the Stroop Color-Word Interference Test (StroopT) were administered to screen for global cognitive status, to quantify depressive symptoms, and to explore executive functions, respectively. Mean blood flow velocity (MBFV), peak systolic blood flow velocity (PSV), end-diastolic blood flow velocity (EDV), pulsatility index (PI), and resistivity index (RI) were recorded from the middle cerebral artery, bilaterally. Results At follow up, patients exhibited a significant worsening of both MoCA (21.7 \u00b1 2.1 vs. 20.7 \u00b1 2.0) and StroopT scores (57.4 \u00b1 19.4 vs. 59.7 \u00b1 18.6), whereas HDRS showed an improvement, although the mean raw score remained above the cut-off value for depression (10.3 \u00b1 6.6 vs. 9.8 \u00b1 6.3). MBFV, PSV, and EDV showed a significant increase in PSV and PI and a reduction in EDV. When focused to younger patients (<65 years), we confirmed the significant worsening of both MoCA and StroopT but not HDRS, as well as the significant changes in PI and RI. Finally, considering the differences (D) between baseline and follow-up, the following significant correlations emerged, although with a small-to-medium effect size for all of them: positive correlation between MBFV-D and MoCA-D and between RI-D and STROOP-D, and a negative significant correlation between RI-D and MoCA-D. Conclusions Notwithstanding some limitations, such as the lack of a control group and neuroimaging data at follow-up, TCD may contribute to the early detection, monitoring, and management of VCI patients at risk for dementia.

H2S is produced by sulfate-reducing bacteria in the gut and acts as a critical signaling molecule influencing brain health via various pathways, including regulating inflammation, oxidative stress, and immune responses. H2S maintains gut barrier integrity at physiological levels and prevents systemic inflammation, which could impact neuroinflammation. However, as H2S has a dual role or a Janus face, excessive H2S production, often resulting from gut dysbiosis, can compromise the intestinal barrier and exacerbate neurodegenerative processes by promoting neuroinflammation and glial cell dysfunction. This imbalance is linked to the early pathogenesis of Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s diseases, where the overproduction of H2S exacerbates beta-amyloid deposition, tau hyperphosphorylation, and alpha-synuclein aggregation, driving neuroinflammatory responses and neuronal damage. Targeting gut microbiota to restore H2S homeostasis through dietary interventions, probiotics, prebiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation presents a promising therapeutic approach.

Dysregulation of apoptosis, a key process for maintaining immune homeostasis, plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of SLE. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), small non\u2010coding RNAs that regulate gene expression, have emerged as important modulators of apoptosis in immune cells, influencing the balance between immune tolerance and autoimmunity. Objectives This review aims to comprehensively summarize recent advancements in understanding the roles of miRNAs in apoptosis regulation within immune cells in SLE, highlighting their therapeutic potential for restoring immune balance and mitigating disease progression. Results Aberrant expression of specific miRNAs contributes to the dysregulation of apoptosis in SLE immune cells. Pro\u2010apoptotic miRNAs, such as miR\u2010125b and miR\u2010150, are often downregulated, leading to enhanced survival of autoreactive immune cells. Conversely, anti\u2010apoptotic miRNAs, including miR\u201021, are upregulated, further disrupting the delicate balance of immune cell apoptosis. Dual\u2010function miRNAs, such as miR\u2010155, exhibit context\u2010dependent roles based on cellular environments and target gene interactions. This dysregulation promotes the persistence of autoreactive immune cells and the development of autoimmunity. Conclusions miRNAs play critical roles in modulating apoptosis pathways, making them promising therapeutic targets for SLE. Restoring the balance of pro\u2010apoptotic and anti\u2010apoptotic miRNAs could help reinstate immune tolerance and reduce tissue damage.

The most appropriate algorithm for population-based screening is unknown.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe invited 37,887 men who were 50 to 60 years of age to undergo regular prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening. Participants with a PSA level of 3 ng per milliliter or higher underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the prostate; one third of the participants were randomly assigned to a reference group that underwent systematic biopsy as well as targeted biopsy of suspicious lesions shown on MRI. The remaining participants were assigned to the experimental group and underwent MRI-targeted biopsy only. The primary outcome was clinically insignificant prostate cancer, defined as a Gleason score of 3+3. The secondary outcome was clinically significant prostate cancer, defined as a Gleason score of at least 3+4. Safety was also assessed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf the men who were invited to undergo screening, 17,980 (47%) participated in the trial. A total of 66 of the 11,986 participants in the experimental group (0.6%) received a diagnosis of clinically insignificant prostate cancer, as compared with 72 of 5994 participants (1.2%) in the reference group, a difference of -0.7 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], -1.0 to -0.4; relative risk, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.33 to 0.64; P<0.001). The relative risk of clinically significant prostate cancer in the experimental group as compared with the reference group was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.60 to 1.1).

Although imaging, particularly multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI), has emerged in the prebiopsy pathway for the diagnosis of prostate cancer, the role of mpMRI in patient selection for AS and the necessity of prostate biopsies during AS remain poorly defined. Despite well-founded biopsy schedules, there has been substantial investigation into whether imaging may supplant the need for prostate biopsies during AS. This review aimed to summarize the contemporary role of imaging in the diagnosis and surveillance of prostate cancer.\n\n\nObservations\nMultiparametric MRI is the most established form of imaging in prostate cancer, with routine prebiopsy use being shown to help urologists distinguish between clinically significant and clinically insignificant disease. The visibility of these lesions on mpMRI closely correlates with their behavior, with visible disease portending a worse prognosis. Combined with other clinical data, risk calculators may better delineate patients with higher-risk disease and exclude them from undergoing AS. While current evidence suggests that mpMRI cannot replace the need for prostate biopsy during AS due to the possibility of missing higher-risk disease, the addition of prostate biomarkers may help to reduce the frequency of these biopsies. The role of prostate-specific antigen positron emission tomography/computed tomography is still emerging but has shown promising early results as an adjunct to mpMRI in initial diagnosis.\n\n\nConclusions and Relevance\nImaging in prostate cancer helps to better select patients appropriate for AS, and future studies may strengthen the predictive capabilities of risk calculators.

Given the complex environment of the digestive tract and the challenge of detecting multi-category lesion images, enhancing model generalization ability is crucial. However, traditional data augmentation methods struggle to generate sufficiently diverse data. In this study, we propose a novel generative adversarial network, Special Common Attention Generative Adversarial Network (SCAGAN), to generate lesion images for capsule endoscopy. The SCAGAN model can adaptively integrate both the internal features and external global dependencies of the samples, enabling the generator to not only accurately capture the key structures and features of capsule endoscopic images, but also enhance the modeling of lesion complexity. Additionally, SCAGAN incorporates global context information to improve the overall consistency and detail of the generated images. To further enhance adaptability, self-modulation normalization is used, along with the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) loss function to ensure structural authenticity. The Differentiable Data Augmentation (DiffAug) technique is employed to improve the model\u2019s performance in small sample environments and balance the training process by adjusting learning rates to address issues of slow learning due to discriminator regularization. Experimental results show that SCAGAN significantly improves image quality and diversity, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) index. Moreover, when the generated lesion images were added to the dataset, the mean average precision (mAP) of the YOLOv9-based lesion detection model increased by 1.495%, demonstrating SCAGAN\u2019s effectiveness in optimizing lesion detection. SCAGAN effectively addresses the challenges of lesion image generation for capsule endoscopy, improving both image quality and detection model performance.

Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Studies comparing general mental health, anxiety symptoms, or depression symptoms assessed from 1 January 2020 or later with outcomes collected from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2019 in any population, and comprising \u226590% of the same participants before and during the covid-19 pandemic or using statistical methods to account for missing data. Restricted maximum likelihood random effects meta-analyses (worse covid-19 outcomes representing positive change) were performed. Risk of bias was assessed using an adapted Joanna Briggs Institute Checklist for Prevalence Studies. Results As of 11 April 2022, 94\u2009411 unique titles and abstracts including 137 unique studies from 134 cohorts were reviewed. Most of the studies were from high income (n=105, 77%) or upper middle income (n=28, 20%) countries. Among general population studies, no changes were found for general mental health (standardised mean difference (SMD)change 0.11, 95% confidence interval \u22120.00 to 0.22) or anxiety symptoms (0.05, \u22120.04 to 0.13), but depression symptoms worsened minimally (0.12, 0.01 to 0.24). Among women or female participants, general mental health (0.22, 0.08 to 0.35), anxiety symptoms (0.20, 0.12 to 0.29), and depression symptoms (0.22, 0.05 to 0.40) worsened by minimal to small amounts. In 27 other analyses across outcome domains among subgroups other than women or female participants, five analyses suggested that symptoms worsened by minimal or small amounts, and two suggested minimal or small improvements. No other subgroup experienced changes across all outcome domains. In three studies with data from March to April 2020 and late 2020, symptoms were unchanged from pre-covid-19 levels at both assessments or increased initially then returned to pre-covid-19 levels. Substantial heterogeneity and risk of bias were present across analyses. Conclusions High risk of bias in many studies and substantial heterogeneity suggest caution in interpreting results. Nonetheless, most symptom change estimates for general mental health, anxiety symptoms, and depression symptoms were close to zero and not statistically significant, and significant changes were of minimal to small magnitudes.

However, few studies reported long\u2010term monitoring outcomes of patients who experienced pregnancy loss and exhibited positivity for aPLs. Objective We investigated the causes of fetal death in five cases with positive aPLs and traced the patients for changes in aPLs, subsequent pregnancy outcomes, and thrombotic events. Methods This is a report of five typical cases from a prospective cohort study on the diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) in patients who were hospitalized for fetal death in Xining, China. Long\u2010term follow\u2010up was conducted and repeat aPL testing was recommended when the patients were confirmed or suspect APS. Results All five patients had subsequent pregnancies that resulted in term livebirths. None of the patients experienced thrombotic events. One showed progression of aPL serostatus from alone IgM of a\u03b22GP\u20101 to both IgM and IgG of a\u03b22GP\u20101, two exhibited fluctuation of aPL serostatus, and one had negative conversion, and the other one had not retested aPLs and did not receive any intervention with uneventful subsequent pregnancy. Conclusions The aPLs of a patient with APS may develop or may disappear, so long\u2010term monitoring cannot be discounted.

A gradual coordinated process connecting paediatric and adult healthcare providers may improve adherence to adult follow\u2010up. Aims To describe a transition process developed jointly by paediatric and adult diabetology units and compare patients progressing or not to follow\u2010up in adult care setting. Materiel and Methods Retrospective study in one paediatric and one adult diabetology department. Patients following from 2014 to 2021 in the paediatric department were eligible.

This oxidative burden adversely affects various aspects of diabetes, including impaired beta-cell function and insulin resistance, leading to disrupted glucose regulation. Additionally, oxidative stress-induced damage to blood vessels and impaired endothelial function contribute to the development of diabetic vascular complications such as retinopathy, nephropathy, and cardiovascular diseases.

We reported previously that peanut shell extract (PSE) improves mitochondrial function in db/db mice by suppressing oxidative stress and inflammation in the liver, brain, and white adipose tissue. This study evaluated the impacts of PSE supplementation on glucose homeostasis, liver histology, intestinal microbiome composition, and the innate immune response in diabetic mice. Methods: Fourteen db/db mice were randomly assigned to a diabetic group (DM, AIN-93G diet) and a PSE group (1% wt/wt PSE in the AIN-93G diet) for 5 weeks. Six C57BL/6J mice received the AIN-93G diet for 5 weeks (control group). Parameters of glucose homeostasis included serum insulin, HOMA-IR, HOMA-B, and the analysis of pancreatic tissues for insulin and glucagon. We assessed the innate immune response in the colon and liver using a microarray. Gut microbiome composition of cecal contents was analyzed using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Results: PSE supplementation improved glucose homeostasis (decreased serum insulin concentration, HOMA-IR, and HOMA-B) and reduced hepatic lipidosis in diabetic mice. PSE supplementation reversed DM-induced shifts in the relative abundance of amplicon sequence variants of Enterorhabdus, Staphylococcus, Anaerotruncus, and Akkermansia. Relative to the DM mice, the PSE group had suppressed gene expression levels of Cd8\u03b1, Csf2, and Irf23 and increased expression levels of Tyk2, Myd88, and Gusb in the liver.

However, the generalizability of previous meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is questioned. Therefore, a contemporary updated meta-analysis was undertaken. Methods and results Database and trial registry searches were conducted to September 2020, seeking RCTs of exercise-based interventions with \u22656-month follow-up, compared with no-exercise control for adults with myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, or following coronary artery bypass graft, or percutaneous coronary intervention. The outcomes of mortality, recurrent clinical events, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis, and cost-effectiveness data were narratively synthesized. Meta-regression was used to examine effect modification. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. A total of 85 RCTs involving 23 430 participants with a median 12-month follow-up were included. Overall, exercise-based CR was associated with significant risk reductions in cardiovascular mortality [risk ratio (RR): 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.64\u20130.86, number needed to treat (NNT): 37], hospitalizations (RR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.67\u20130.89, NNT: 37), and myocardial infarction (RR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.70\u20130.96, NNT: 100).

A methylcellulose-based hydrogel served as a conventional reference product. Results revealed that alginate particles exhibited at least a 10-fold increase in mean dissolution time compared to the methylcellulose gel, indicating superior stability. Increasing atorvastatin concentration extended the time interval needed for 50% of the drug to be released (t50%) from 1 h to 11 h, maintaining the overall drug diffusion level for several days. Further analysis showed that covalent cross-linking of alginate with divinyl sulfone significantly delayed the initial drug release by 3 h (p < 0.05) due to the additional molecular stabilization.

Any error while developing or identifying unique markers could lead to unreliable and inaccurate DIC results. This study introduces a novel artificial intelligence (AI)-based approach to identify and generate distinctive feature-rich natural markers for DIC. The proposed technique includes a crucial preprocessing step, which comprises an instance segmentation model built with the you only look once (YOLOv8) and the segment anything model (SAM) deep learning algorithms. This model ensures that the markers are integral to the structure rather than a part of the background.

The expression of TBL2 is analyzed using real\u2010time PCR, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry in BC patient specimens. Kaplan\u2013Meier survival analysis is employed to assess its prognostic significance.

The findings reveal selective overexpression of TBL2 in BC, correlating significantly with various clinicopathological characteristics and poor survival outcomes in patients with BC. Through in vivo and in vitro experiments, it is observed that TBL2 suppression inhibits BC cell proliferation, while TBL2 overexpression has the opposite effect. Mechanistically, TBL2 is identified as a scaffolding protein that promotes PRMT5 and WDR77 interaction. This interaction enhances the methyltransferase activity of PRMT5, leading to increased AKT phosphorylation activation and promotion of breast cancer cell proliferation.

The frequent occurrence of initial and acquired resistance to pemetrexed results in limited treatment effectiveness in brain metastases. CD146 was recently found to play important roles in chemoresistance and tumor progression. However, the underlying mechanisms of CD146\u2019s effects in pemetrexed resistance remain undefined. Method and results Sensitivity to pemetrexed was assessed with a preclinical brain metastasis (BM) model based on lung adenocarcinoma PC9 cells. The role and mechanism of CD146 in pemetrexed resistance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) brain metastasis were explored in vitro and in vivo. A subpopulation of brain metastatic cells derived from progenitor PC9 cells (PC9-BrMS) was significantly resistant to pemetrexed. CD146 levels were significantly increased in pemetrexed resistant brain metastases, while CD146 inhibition suppressed pemetrexed resistance in BM cells. Mechanistically, CD146 mediated pemetrexed resistance in brain metastatic cells by promoting DNA damage repair, maintaining normal cell cycle progression, and regulating the NF-KB pathway to counter apoptosis, and these effects was based on increased DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, and occurrence of apoptosis after CD146 inhibition as well as the reemergence of pemetrexed resistance after CD146 restoration.

These conditions are not easily detectable in clinical practice, due to the overlap between medical and psychiatric symptoms, as described by diagnostic manuals such as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) and International Classification of Diseases (ICD). Moreover, it is particularly challenging to distinguish between pathological and normal reactions to such a severe illness. Depressive symptoms, even in subthreshold manifestations, have a negative impact in terms of quality of life, compliance with anticancer treatment, suicide risk and possibly the mortality rate for the cancer itself. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on the efficacy, tolerability and acceptability of antidepressants in this population are few and often report conflicting results.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo evaluate the efficacy, tolerability and acceptability of antidepressants for treating depressive symptoms in adults (aged 18 years or older) with cancer (any site and stage).\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nWe used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was November 2022.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nWe included RCTs comparing antidepressants versus placebo, or antidepressants versus other antidepressants, in adults (aged 18 years or above) with any primary diagnosis of cancer and depression (including major depressive disorder, adjustment disorder, dysthymic disorder or depressive symptoms in the absence of a formal diagnosis).\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nWe used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcome was 1. efficacy as a continuous outcome. Our secondary outcomes were 2. efficacy as a dichotomous outcome, 3. Social adjustment, 4. health-related quality of life and 5. dropouts. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence for each outcome.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nWe identified 14 studies (1364 participants), 10 of which contributed to the meta-analysis for the primary outcome. Six of these compared antidepressants and placebo, three compared two antidepressants, and one three-armed study compared two antidepressants and placebo. In this update, we included four additional studies, three of which contributed data for the primary outcome. For acute-phase treatment response (six to 12 weeks), antidepressants may reduce depressive symptoms when compared with placebo, even though the evidence is very uncertain. This was true when depressive symptoms were measured as a continuous outcome (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.92 to -0.12; 7 studies, 511 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and when measured as a proportion of people who had depression at the end of the study (risk ratio (RR) 0.74, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.96; 5 studies, 662 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No studies reported data on follow-up response (more than 12 weeks). In head-to-head comparisons, we retrieved data for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) versus tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and for mirtazapine versus TCAs. There was no difference between the various classes of antidepressants (continuous outcome: SSRI versus TCA: SMD -0.08, 95% CI -0.34 to 0.18; 3 studies, 237 participants; very low-certainty evidence; mirtazapine versus TCA: SMD -4.80, 95% CI -9.70 to 0.10; 1 study, 25 participants). There was a potential beneficial effect of antidepressants versus placebo for the secondary efficacy outcomes (continuous outcome, response at one to four weeks; very low-certainty evidence). There were no differences for these outcomes when comparing two different classes of antidepressants, even though the evidence was very uncertain. In terms of dropouts due to any cause, we found no difference between antidepressants compared with placebo (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.38; 9 studies, 889 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and between SSRIs and TCAs (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.22; 3 studies, 237 participants). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence because of the heterogeneous quality of the studies, imprecision arising from small sample sizes and wide CIs, and inconsistency due to statistical or clinical heterogeneity.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nDespite the impact of depression on people with cancer, the available studies were few and of low quality. This review found a potential beneficial effect of antidepressants against placebo in depressed participants with cancer. However, the certainty of evidence is very low and, on the basis of these results, it is difficult to draw clear implications for practice. The use of antidepressants in people with cancer should be considered on an individual basis and, considering the lack of head-to-head data, the choice of which drug to prescribe may be based on the data on antidepressant efficacy in the general population of people with major depression, also taking into account that data on people with other serious medical conditions suggest a positive safety profile for the SSRIs. Furthermore, this update shows that the usage of the newly US Food and Drug Administration-approved antidepressant esketamine in its intravenous formulation might represent a potential treatment for this specific population of people, since it can be used both as an anaesthetic and an antidepressant. However, data are too inconclusive and further studies are needed. We conclude that to better inform clinical practice, there is an urgent need for large, simple, randomised, pragmatic trials comparing commonly used antidepressants versus placebo in people with cancer who have depressive symptoms, with or without a formal diagnosis of a depressive disorder.", "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-03-31", "synthetic_support_claim": "Antidepressants may reduce depressive symptoms in adults with cancer compared to placebo, but evidence is uncertain.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Esketamine represents a well-documented and effective treatment for depression in cancer patients."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "82d72cab9b0d2f27a3976702a9364e120a2bf057", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/82d72cab9b0d2f27a3976702a9364e120a2bf057", "title": "The Role of Pharmacogenetic-Based Pharmacokinetic Analysis in Precise Breast Cancer Treatment", "abstract": "Given the high prevalence of breast cancer and the diverse genetic backgrounds of patients, a growing body of research emphasizes the importance of pharmacogenetic-based pharmacokinetic analysis in optimizing treatment outcomes.

The aim of this study was to review the efficacy and safety of dupilumab treatment in conditions underpinned by Th2-type inflammation in a cohort of real-world patients referred to our outpatient clinic. Methods: Data from all patients with atopic dermatitis, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, asthma, and other Th2-type-mediated inflammatory conditions treated with dupilumab were retrospectively reviewed. Results: Twenty-two patients were included in the study: 14 with atopic dermatitis, 5 with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, 2 with asthma, and 1 with prurigo nodularis; some of the patients had more than one atopic condition. A complete response was observed in 13 out of 22 patients (59.1%); when partial responses were included in the analysis, the overall response rate was 86.4%. No adverse events were recorded, either locally or systemically. Total IgE levels dropped in all patients, in some cases reaching values close to those typically observed in nonatopic subjects.

In this prospective study, blood biomarkers of 25 patients undergoing honeybee VIT at the referral center in Slovenia were evaluated. A controlled honeybee sting challenge confirmed successful VIT in 20 of 25 (80%) patients. Honeybee venom (HBV) recombinant allergen profiles, evaluated before the treatment, were comparable between responders and non-responders. Longitudinal follow-up, up to 1 year after finishing VIT, showed that the immune responses do not differ significantly between patients with successful VIT and treatment failure. Those responses were characterized by decreased sIgE, tIgE, and BST, whereas sIgG4 levels increased. The basophil sensitivity also significantly decreases after VIT in both groups of patients. The analyzed biomarker which correlated considerably with treatment failure was higher basophil sensitivity to allergen stimulation before VIT.

Our study demonstrated similar sensitization profiles, and humoral and basophil immune responses to immunotherapy, in two different well-characterized groups of patients, one with successful VIT and the other with treatment failure.

The BAT proved to be able to identify allergic patients at risk of reacting to a low dose of the allergen and/or developing life-threatening reactions and thus can significantly improve the current management of allergic patients. However, to improve the diagnostic utility for identifying the allergenic activity of different genuinely sensitizing allergens and lower the procedure and labour requirements, developing a multiplex BAT approach incorporating multiple allergen components would be highly anticipated. Recently, the novel multiplex BAT was described utilizing two major innovative steps. The first step was the fluorescent labeling of allergens. The second step was applying fluorescently labeled allergens in flow cytometry assessment to analyze the activation of basophil subpopulations gated according to the binding of different allergens or to evaluate the fluorescence intensity of multiple allergens on the surface of basophils. These novel cellular multiplex approaches will advance our understanding of IgE-mediated responses.

SUMMARY ANSWER Pooled estimates of lifetime and period prevalence of 12-month infertility were 17.5% and 12.6%, respectively, but this varied by study population and methodological approach. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY Infertility affects millions of individuals worldwide. Accurate measures of its magnitude are needed to effectively address and manage the condition. There are distinct challenges and variation in how infertility is defined and measured, limiting comparability of estimates across studies. Further research is needed to understand whether and how differences in methodological approaches and study characteristics account for heterogeneity in estimates. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. Six electronic databases, websites of relevant organizations, and conference proceedings were systematically searched. Searches were limited to those published between 1 January 1990 and 11 March 2021, with no language restrictions. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS Descriptive and random-effects meta-analysis models were used to examine range of estimates and generate estimates of pooled lifetime and period prevalence of 12-month infertility, respectively, among representative populations. Meta-regression using restricted maximum likelihood was applied to account for definitional and study characteristics and to obtain adjusted estimates. Risk of bias was assessed with a validated tool. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE The search yielded 12\u200a241 unique records of which 133 studies met the criteria for the systematic review. There were 65 and 69 studies that provided data for lifetime and period prevalence of 12-month infertility, respectively. Five methodological approaches were identified: prospective time-to-pregnancy (TTP) design, current duration design, retrospective TTP design, self-reported infertility measure and constructed infertility measure. Ranges for lifetime (3.3\u201339.7%) and period estimates (1.6\u201334.0%) were similar and wide even after accounting for methodological and study characteristics. Pooled estimates of lifetime and period prevalence were 17.5% (95% CI: 15.0, 20.3, n\u2009=\u200937 studies, I2 = 99.5%) and 12.6% (95% CI: 10.7, 14.6, n\u2009=\u200943 studies, I2 = 99.8%), respectively, with some variation in magnitude by region and methodological approach, but with most CIs overlapping. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION Pooled estimates generated from meta-analysis were derived from 12-month infertility prevalence estimates that were heterogeneous across different domains, even after adjusting for definitional and study characteristics. The number of studies was small for certain strata from which pooled estimates were derived (e.g. there were only two studies for lifetime prevalence in Africa). WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS While findings show a high prevalence of infertility globally and regionally, it also reveals variation in measures to ascertain and compare infertility prevalence. More systematic and comprehensive collection of data using a consistent definition is needed to improve infertility prevalence estimates at global, regional and country-levels.

Recently, the term NAFLD has been changed to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), and NASH has been renamed metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). A multitude of experiments have confirmed the association between CS and the incidence and progression of MASLD.

However, its prognostic value in breast cancer (BRCA) and its biological role in BRCA cells remain unclear. Methods In this research, we examined the varying expression levels of ATP6V0D2 in both BRCA and normal breast tissue by utilizing information derived from databases including the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), along with clinical samples. Survival studies were carried out to investigate the link between ATP6V0D2 levels and prognosis in BRCA patients. A series of enrichment analyses identified possible pathways associated with the differentially expressed genes in BRCA. The relationships among ATP6V0D2 expression, immune characteristics, and gene mutation were evaluated using Spearman\u2019s test. Finally, the expression of ATP6V0D2 was identified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) alongside western blot analysis. Additionally, Cell Counting kit-8 (CCK-8), Colony formation, Transwell, Scratch healing, and Mouse xenograft tumor assays were conducted to assessed the impact of ATP6V0D2 knockdown on the biological functions in TNBC. Results ATP6V0D2 exhibited high expression in a range of cancers and correlated with unfavorable prognosis in BRCA. Functional enrichment analyses revealed enrichment of extracellular matrix-receptor interaction, focal adhesion, and the signaling pathway of tumor growth factor-beta in the high ATP6V0D2 expression group. Additionally, ATP6V0D2 was closely associated with immune checkpoints. Its expression positively associated with the infiltration levels of macrophage and neutrophil, but inversely with CD8+ T and plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Mutation analysis revealed that PIK3CA, linked to decreased OS, exhibited a higher mutation rate in the ATP6V0D2 high expression group. Furthermore, ATP6V0D2 knockdown inhibited TNBC cells invasion, migration, and proliferation abilities.

Se plays a substantial role in the functioning of the human organism. It is incorporated into selenoproteins, thus supporting antioxidant defense systems. Selenoproteins participate in the metabolism of thyroid hormones, control reproductive functions and exert neuroprotective effects. Among the elements, Se has one of the narrowest ranges between dietary deficiency and toxic levels. Its level of toxicity may depend on chemical form, as inorganic and organic species have distinct biological properties. Over the last decades, optimization of population Se intake for the prevention of diseases related to Se deficiency or excess has been recognized as a pressing issue in modern healthcare worldwide. Low selenium status has been associated with an increased risk of mortality, poor immune function, cognitive decline, and thyroid dysfunction. On the other hand, Se concentrations slightly above its nutritional levels have been shown to have adverse effects on a broad spectrum of neurological functions and to increase the risk of type-2 diabetes. Comprehension of the selenium biochemical pathways under normal physiological conditions is therefore an important issue to elucidate its effect on human diseases.

When pesticides are used, the over-application and excess discharge into water bodies during rainfall often lead to death of fish and other aquatic life. Even when the fishes still live, their consumption by humans may lead to the biomagnification of chemicals in the body system and can cause deadly diseases, such as cancer, kidney diseases, diabetes, liver dysfunction, eczema, neurological destruction, cardiovascular diseases, and so on. Equally, synthetic pesticides harm the soil texture, soil microbes, animals, and plants. The dangers associated with the use of synthetic pesticides have necessitated the need for alternative use of organic pesticides (biopesticides), which are cheaper, environment friendly, and sustainable. Biopesticides can be sourced from microbes (e.g., metabolites), plants (e.g., from their exudates, essential oil, and extracts from bark, root, and leaves), and nanoparticles of biological origin (e.g., silver and gold nanoparticles). Unlike synthetic pesticides, microbial pesticides are specific in action, can be easily sourced without the need for expensive chemicals, and are environmentally sustainable without residual effects. Phytopesticides have myriad of phytochemical compounds that make them exhibit various mechanisms of action, likewise, they are not associated with the release of greenhouse gases and are of lesser risks to human health compared to the available synthetic pesticides. Nanobiopesticides have higher pesticidal activity, targeted or controlled release with top-notch biocompatibility and biodegradability.

In this review we critically evaluate the epidemiological and biological evidence on the associations of these factors with PD and review evidence on whether these putative associations are causal. We conclude that when considered in isolation, it is difficult to determine whether these associations are causal, in large part because of the decades-long lag between relevant exposures and the incidence of manifest PD.

This systematic review and meta-analysis is the first to explore these effects. The goal was to analyze and synthesize longitudinal cohort studies to determine impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the development and mental health of young children. Searches of multiple databases were performed for studies published between 2018 and 2023 with pre- and post-pandemic evaluations of the mental health or development of preschool children (aged 0\u20136 years) using objective measures and according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Cohen\u2019s d effect sizes were calculated for each study that utilized the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ), or the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Random-effects mixed models combined the estimates of effect sizes to calculate the overall mean effect size. The meta-analyses included 22,348 children from 16 countries. The analyses showed small increases in emotional symptoms and conduct problems, as well as increases in emotional reactivity, anxiety/depression, withdrawal symptoms, attention problems, and aggressive behaviors.

Interviews were performed with adolescents 13\u201317 years old (n = 33) who participated in a randomised controlled trial evaluating the effects of aerobic group exercise versus leisure group activities for adolescents with depression. The results were interpreted into four metaphors to embody the understanding of health as described by adolescents with depression: 1) establishing sound routines by managing everyday life, 2) connecting to others by having access to social resources, 3) managing depression symptoms by having control over the mental illness, and 4) attaining inner drive by experiencing joy in everyday life. The various conceptions of health among adolescents with depression provide valuable insights for enhancing evidence-based treatments with person-centred care. Key aspects include establishing routines, fostering connections, finding strategies for symptom control, and incorporating joy through exercise.

PURPOSE The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 10981-22023 AMAROS trial evaluated axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) versus axillary radiotherapy (ART) in patients with cT1-2, node-negative breast cancer and a positive sentinel node (SN) biopsy. At 5 years, both modalities showed excellent and comparable axillary control, with significantly less morbidity after ART. We now report the preplanned 10-year analysis of the axillary recurrence rate (ARR), overall survival (OS), and disease-free survival (DFS), and an updated 5-year analysis of morbidity and quality of life. METHODS In this open-label multicenter phase III noninferiority trial, 4,806 patients underwent SN biopsy; 1,425 were node-positive and randomly assigned to either ALND (n = 744) or ART (n = 681). RESULTS Per intention-to-treat analysis, 10-year ARR cumulative incidence was 0.93% (95% CI, 0.18 to 1.68; seven events) after ALND and 1.82% (95% CI, 0.74 to 2.94; 11 events) after ART (hazard ratio [HR], 1.71; 95% CI, 0.67 to 4.39). There were no differences in OS (HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.52) or DFS (HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.97 to 1.46). ALND was associated with a higher lymphedema rate in updated 5-year analyses (24.5% v 11.9%; P < .001). Quality-of-life scales did not differ by treatment through 5 years. Exploratory analysis showed a 10-year cumulative incidence of second primary cancers of 12.1% (95% CI, 9.6 to 14.9) after ART and 8.3% (95% CI, 6.3 to 10.7) after ALND.

Patients 18 years and older with 1 to 3 painful extremity bone metastases and life expectancies of 2 months or more were eligible. Patients were excluded if they had foot, hand, and wrist metastases; metastases locally treated in the 2 weeks prior; metal implants in the treatment field; known enhanced tissue radiosensitivity; and implanted devices at risk of malfunction with radiotherapy. One of 11 patients who consented was excluded based on eligibility. The end points were evaluated at 3 months posttreatment, and patients were followed up through death or loss to follow-up for toxic effects and pain assessments. Of the 10 included patients, 2 died after the 2-month follow-up but before the 3-month follow-up; 8 participants completed the 3-month evaluation.

This is consistent with standard of care using the same prescription (8 Gy in a single fraction) but on a conventional-dose-rate (approximately 0.03 Gy/sec) photon radiotherapy system.\n\n\nMain Outcome and Measures\nMain outcomes included patient time on the treatment couch, device-related treatment delays, adverse events related to FLASH, patient-reported pain scores, and analgesic use.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 10 patients (age range, 27-81 years [median age, 63 years]; 5 [50%] male) underwent FLASH radiotherapy at 12 metastatic sites. There were no FLASH-related technical issues or delays. The average (range) time on the treatment couch was 18.9 (11-33) minutes per patient and 15.8 (11-22) minutes per treatment site. Median (range) follow-up was 4.8 (2.3-13.0) months. Adverse events were mild and consistent with conventional radiotherapy. Transient pain flares occurred in 4 of the 12 treated sites (33%). In 8 of the 12 sites (67%) patients reported pain relief, and in 6 of the 12 sites (50%) patients reported a complete response (no pain).\n\n\nConclusions and Relevance\nIn this nonrandomized trial, clinical workflow metrics, treatment efficacy, and safety data demonstrated that ultra-high-dose-rate proton FLASH radiotherapy was clinically feasible. The treatment efficacy and the profile of adverse events were comparable with those of standard-of-care radiotherapy. These findings support the further exploration of FLASH radiotherapy in patients with cancer.\n\n\nTrial Registration\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04592887.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-10-23", "synthetic_support_claim": "Ultra-high-dose-rate proton FLASH radiotherapy is clinically feasible with comparable efficacy to standard radiotherapy.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "FLASH therapy improves overall survival in patients with extremity bone metastases."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "f9c29537fee986db10babc41ad9bd1982ae991f2", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f9c29537fee986db10babc41ad9bd1982ae991f2", "title": "Commissioning a clinical proton pencil beam scanning beamline for pre-clinical ultra-high dose rate irradiations on a cyclotron-based system", "abstract": "Background This manuscript describes modifications to a pencil beam scanning (PBS) proton gantry that enables ultra-high dose rates (UHDR) irradiation, including treatment planning and validation. Methods Beamline modifications consisted of opening the energy slits and setting the degrader to pass-through mode to maximize the dose rate. A range shifter was inserted upstream from the isocenter to enlarge the spot size and make it rotationally symmetric. We measured the beamline transport efficiency and investigated the variation in output due to the recombination of charge in the dose monitoring chamber. The output calibration was performed through a parallel plate chamber (PPC05), and an intercomparison was performed for various detectors. The pre-clinical field for mice irradiation consisted of different dose levels to deliver uniform doses in transmission mode. The field dose rates were determined through log files while scripting in TPS was used to estimate PBS dose rates. The survival experiments consisted of irradiating the full pelvis of the mice at UHDR and conventional dose rates. Results The spot size was constant with beam current and had a sigma of 8.5 mm at the isocenter. The beam output increased by 35% at 720 nA compared to 5.6 nA, primarily due to recombination in the dose-monitoring ion chambers. The Faraday Cup and PPC05 agreed within 2%, while other detectors were within 3% of FC for dose rates <60 Gy/s. The pre-clinical fields\u2019 PBS dose rate is above 45 Gy/sec for all voxels within the target volume.

The H5 influenza viruses are spread by migratory wild birds and have caused three waves of influenza outbreaks across multiple continents, and the third wave that started in 2020 is ongoing. Many countries in Europe and North America control highly pathogenic avian influenza by culling alone, whereas some countries, including China, have adopted a \u201ccull plus vaccination\u201d strategy.

The H7N9 virus exhibits a complex reassortment history, receiving genes from H9N2 and other avian influenza viruses. The presence of certain molecular markers, such as mutations in the hemagglutinin and polymerase basic protein 2, enhances the virus's adaptability to human hosts. The virus activates innate immune responses through pattern recognition receptors, leading to cytokine production and inflammation. Clinical manifestations range from mild to severe, with complications including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and multiorgan failure. Diagnosis relies on molecular assays such as reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The increasing frequency of human infections, along with the virus's ability to bind to human receptors and cause severe disease, highlights its pandemic potential.

The Panel is aware that a new generation of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) targeting the HER2 protein is active against breast cancers that lack protein overexpression or gene amplification. METHODS An Update Panel conducted a systematic literature review to identify signals for updating recommendations. RESULTS The search identified 173 abstracts. Of five potential publications reviewed, none constituted a signal for revising existing recommendations. RECOMMENDATIONS The 2018 ASCO-CAP recommendations for HER2 testing are affirmed. DISCUSSION HER2 testing guidelines have focused on identifying HER2 protein overexpression or gene amplification in breast cancer to identify patients for therapies that disrupt HER2 signaling. This update acknowledges a new indication for trastuzumab deruxtecan when HER2 is not overexpressed or amplified but is immunohistochemistry (IHC) 1+ or 2+ without amplification by in situ hybridization. Clinical trial data on tumors that tested IHC 0 are limited (excluded from DESTINY-Breast04), and evidence is lacking that these cancers behave differently or do not respond similarly to newer HER2 ADCs. Although current data do not support a new IHC 0 versus 1+ prognostic or predictive threshold for response to trastuzumab deruxtecan, this threshold is now relevant because of the trial entry criteria that supported its new regulatory approval.

Through genome association analysis of sorghum, a naturally high-alkaline\u2013tolerant crop, we detected a major locus, Alkaline Tolerance 1 (AT1), specifically related to alkaline-salinity sensitivity. An at1 allele with a carboxyl-terminal truncation increased sensitivity, whereas knockout of AT1 increased tolerance to alkalinity in sorghum, millet, rice, and maize. AT1 encodes an atypical G protein \u03b3 subunit that affects the phosphorylation of aquaporins to modulate the distribution of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). These processes appear to protect plants against oxidative stress by alkali. Designing knockouts of AT1 homologs or selecting its natural nonfunctional alleles could improve crop productivity in sodic lands. Description Growth on alkaline soils Alkaline soils limit the ability of plants to take in nutrients and manage salt stress. Zhang et al. have now identified a locus in sorghum that determines sensitivity to salty alkaline soils. The Alkali Tolerance 1 (AT1) locus encodes a guanine nucleotide\u2013binding protein gamma subunit that regulates the phosphorylation of aquaporins, channels that can transport hydrogen peroxide to alleviate oxidative stress. Crops that could better manage growth on alkaline soils could open up agriculture to the millions of hectares of alkaline soils. \u2014PJH Regulation of phosphorylation on aquaporin underlies the ability of sorghum to tolerate alkaline soils. INTRODUCTION According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), there are currently >1 billion ha of land affected by salt. Among these, ~60% are classified as sodic soil areas. These have high pH and are dominated by sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) and sodium carbonate (Na2CO3). The effects of global warming and a lack of fresh water will lead to >50% of arable land becoming affected by salt by 2050, thus severely affecting the world\u2019s food security. Identifying and/or engineering sodic-tolerant crops is imperative to solve this challenge. Although salinity tolerance has been studied extensively, alkalinity tolerance in plants has not been studied in depth. RATIONALE Sorghum originates from Africa, where it can grow in harsh environments. As a result, sorghum has evolved greater tolerance to adapt to multiple abiotic stresses compared with other crops. Some sorghum varieties can survive in sodic soil with a pH as high as 10.0. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis was performed with a large sorghum association panel consisting of 352 representative sorghum accessions. We detected a major locus, Alkaline tolerance 1 (AT1), linked to alkaline tolerance. We found that AT1, encoding an atypical G protein \u03b3 subunit (a homolog to rice GS3), contributes to alkaline sensitivity by modulating the efflux of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) under environmental stress. RESULTS On the basis of the results of the GWAS analysis, we sequenced the cDNA regions of SbAT1 (Sorghum bicolor AT1) in 37 sorghum accessions with different degrees of alkaline sensitivity. Two typical haplotypes (Hap1 and Hap2) of SbAT1 were identified according to the five leading variant sites associated with sorghum alkali sensitivity. Hap1 encodes an intact SbAT1. A frame shift mutation (from \u201cG\u201d to \u201cGGTGGC\u201d) within Hap2 results in a premature stop codon probably encoding a truncated protein with only 136 amino acids at the N terminus (named Sbat1). To confirm the function of the AT1 locus, we generated a pair of near-isogenic lines (NILs) with two AT1 haplotypes to assess the allelic effect of AT1 on sorghum tolerance to alkali. We found that the Sbat1 allele (Hap2), encoding a truncated form of SbAT1, increased plant alkaline sensitivity compared with wild-type full-length SbAT1 (Hap1). Overexpression of AT1/GS3 reduced alkaline tolerance in sorghum and rice, and overexpression of the C-terminal truncated AT1/GS3 showed a more severe alkaline sensitive response. This was confirmed in millet and rice, which suggests that AT1/GS3 functions negatively in plant alkali tolerance. By contrast, knockout (ko) of AT1/GS3 increased tolerance to alkaline stress in sorghum, millet, rice, and maize, which indicates a conserved pathway in monocot crops. By immunoprecipitation in combination with mass spectrometry (IP-MS), we found that AT1/GS3 interacts with aquaporin PIP2s that are involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis. Genetic analysis showed that OsPIP2;1ko/2;2ko had lower alkaline tolerance than their wild-type control. The redox probe Cyto-roGFP2-Orp1 sensing H2O2 in the cytoplasm was applied. The results showed that, upon alkaline treatment, the relative H2O2 level increased in OsPIP2;1ko/2;2ko compared with wild-type plants. These results suggested that the phosphorylation of aquaporins could modulate the efflux of H2O2. G\u03b3 negatively regulates the phosphorylation of PIP2;1, leading to elevated ROS levels in plants under alkaline stress. To assess the application of the AT1/GS3 gene for crop production, field tests were carried out. We found that the nonfunctional mutant, either obtained from natural varieties or generated by gene editing in several monocots, including sorghum, millet, rice, and maize, can improve the field performance of crops in terms of biomass or grain production when cultivated on sodic lands. CONCLUSION We concluded that SbAT1 encodes an atypical G protein \u03b3 subunit and inhibits the phosphorylation of aquaporins that may be used as H2O2 exporters under alkaline stress. With this knowledge, genetically engineered crops with knockouts of AT1 homologs or use of natural nonfunctional alleles could greatly improve crop yield in sodic lands. This may contribute to maximizing the use of global sodic lands to ensure food security. Genetic modification of AT1 enhances alkaline stress tolerance. The G\u03b3 subunit, AT1, pairs with G\u03b2 to negatively modulate the phosphorylation level of PIP2 aquaporins. Thus, AT1 reduces the H2O2 export activity of PIP2s, leading to the overaccumulation of H2O2 and resulting in alkaline stress sensitivity. By contrast, the artificial or natural knockouts of AT1 homologs release the inhibition of PIP2s by AT1 in crops and have improved survival rates and yield under alkaline stress.

Cerebral ischemic stroke involves many pathological processes such as oxidative stress, inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction.

Rapid industrialization, emissions from automobiles, agricultural inputs, improper disposal of waste, etc., are the major causes of soil contamination with heavy metals. These contaminants not only contaminate soil but also groundwater, reducing agricultural land and hence food quality. These contaminants enter the food chain and have a severe effect on human health. It is important to remove these contaminants from the soil. Various economic and ecological strategies are required to restore the soils contaminated with heavy metals. Phytoremediation is an emerging technology that is non-invasive, cost-effective, and aesthetically pleasing. Many metal-binding proteins (MBPs) of the plants are significantly involved in the phytoremediation of heavy metals; the MBPs include metallothioneins; phytochelatins; metalloenzymes; metal-activated enzymes; and many metal storage proteins, carrier proteins, and channel proteins. Plants are genetically modified to enhance their phytoremediation capacity. In Arabidopsis, the expression of the mercuric ion-binding protein in Bacillus megaterium improves the metal accumulation capacity. The phytoremediation efficiency of plants is also enhanced when assisted with microorganisms, biochar, and/or chemicals. Removing heavy metals from agricultural land without challenging food security is almost impossible. As a result, crop selections with the ability to sequester heavy metals and provide food security are in high demand.

The present study aimed to assess the phytoremediation potential of two free-floating aquatic macrophytes (Eichhornia crassipes and Pistia stratiotes) systems for enhancing the water quality collected from two polluted urban streams. The trials were performed in 25-L experimental units for seven days under ambient conditions.

The substrate (spoil) used in the present study was derived from areas close to laterite (Ni-containing ores) mines. The efficiency of biochar addition in two rates (5 t/ha and 20 t/ha) to improve microbial properties and stabilize soil aggregates was also examined. Furthermore, the effect of irrigation with air-nanobubble-supplemented water was evaluated for the remediation of toxic metal spoils. The physiological condition of the plant species was investigated in terms of biomass, height, chlorophyll content, and antioxidant enzymes. The alkali and heavy metal accumulation and their distribution in the plant parts were assessed to explore whether toxic metals could accumulate in the root and further translocate to the aboveground tissues. The growth of T. smyrnensis was not adversely affected by its cultivation in lateritic spoil, and the highest rate of biochar exhibited a beneficial effect on plant growth in terms of weight (aerial and subterranean biomass). The highest biochar application rate led to significant increases in total chlorophyll content, showing a 97.6% increase when biochar is used alone and a 136% increase when combined with nanobubble irrigation. Remarkably, only when combining irrigation with air nanobubbles and low biochar supplementation did the translocation of the metals from soil to the aboveground tissues occur as the translocation factor was estimated to be greater than unity (TF > 1). The bioconcentration factors remained below 1.0 (BCF < 1) across all treatments, demonstrating limited mobilization from soil to plant tissues despite the application of soil amendments.

Recently, a new clinical-molecular prognostic model, the Molecular International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-M) was proposed to improve the prediction of clinical outcome of the currently available tool (Revised International Prognostic Scoring System [IPSS-R]). We aimed to provide an extensive validation of IPSS-M. METHODS A total of 2,876 patients with primary MDS from the GenoMed4All consortium were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS IPSS-M improved prognostic discrimination across all clinical end points with respect to IPSS-R (concordance was 0.81 v 0.74 for overall survival and 0.89 v 0.76 for leukemia-free survival, respectively). This was true even in those patients without detectable gene mutations. Compared with the IPSS-R based stratification, the IPSS-M risk group changed in 46% of patients (23.6% and 22.4% of subjects were upstaged and downstaged, respectively). In patients treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), IPSS-M significantly improved the prediction of the risk of disease relapse and the probability of post-transplantation survival versus IPSS-R (concordance was 0.76 v 0.60 for overall survival and 0.89 v 0.70 for probability of relapse, respectively). In high-risk patients treated with hypomethylating agents (HMA), IPSS-M failed to stratify individual probability of response; response duration and probability of survival were inversely related to IPSS-M risk. Finally, we tested the accuracy in predicting IPSS-M when molecular information was missed and we defined a minimum set of 15 relevant genes associated with high performance of the score. CONCLUSION IPSS-M improves MDS prognostication and might result in a more effective selection of candidates to HSCT. Additional factors other than gene mutations can be involved in determining HMA sensitivity. The definition of a minimum set of relevant genes may facilitate the clinical implementation of the score.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-03-17", "synthetic_support_claim": "IPSS-M improves prognostic discrimination across all clinical end points compared with IPSS-R.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Gene therapy significantly improves overall survival rates in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "99cffb2972b3a36fa0137217b9108b0334aa8c1c", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/99cffb2972b3a36fa0137217b9108b0334aa8c1c", "title": "Future directions in myelodysplastic syndromes/neoplasms and acute myeloid leukaemia classification: from blast counts to biology.", "abstract": "Myelodysplastic syndromes/neoplasms (MDS) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) are neoplastic haematopoietic cell proliferations that are diagnosed and classified based on a combination of morphological, clinical and genetic features. Specifically, the percentage of myeloblasts in the blood and bone marrow is a key feature that has historically separated MDS from AML and, together with several other morphological parameters, defines distinct disease entities within MDS. Both MDS and AML have recurrent genetic abnormalities that are increasingly influencing their definitions and subclassification. For example, in 2022, two new MDS entities were recognised based on the presence of SF3B1 mutation or bi-allelic TP53 abnormalities. Genomic information is more objective and reproducible than morphological analyses, which are subject to interobserver variability and arbitrary numeric cut-offs. Nevertheless, the integration of genomic data with traditional morphological features in myeloid neoplasm classification has proved challenging by virtue of its sheer complexity; gene expression and methylation profiling also can provide information regarding disease pathogenesis, adding to the complexity. New machine-learning technologies have the potential to effectively integrate multiple diagnostic modalities and improve on historical classification systems. Going forward, the application of machine learning and advanced statistical methods to large patient cohorts can refine future classifications by advancing unbiased and robust previously unrecognised disease subgroups.

Domain antibodies have commonly been sourced from camelids with ex-vivo humanization or transgenic rodents expressing heavy chains without light chains, but these host species are all mammalian, limiting their capacity to elicit robust immune responses to conserved mammalian targets. We have developed transgenic chickens expressing heavy chain-only antibodies with a human variable region to combine the superior target recognition advantages of a divergent, non-mammalian host with the ability to discover single-domain binders.

These constructs are small therapeutic proteins formed by a variable domain of the heavy chain of an antibody with multiple therapeutic and production benefits compared with their mAb counterparts. These proteins can be subjected to different bioconjugation processes to form single-domain antibody-drug conjugates (sdADCs) and hence increase their therapeutic potency, and akin to other therapeutic proteins, nanobodies and related products require dedicated analytical strategies to fully characterize their primary structure prior to their release to the market. In this study, we report for the first time the extensive sequence characterization of a conjugated anti-EGFR 14 kDa sdADC by using state-of-the-art top-down mass spectrometry strategies in combination with liquid chromatography (LC-TD-MS). Mass analysis revealed a highly homogeneous sample with one conjugated molecule. Subsequently, the reduced sdADC was submitted to different fragmentation techniques, namely, higher-energy collisional dissociation, electron-transfer dissociation, and electron-transfer higher-energy collision dissociation, allowing to unambiguously assess the conjugation site with 24 diagnostic fragment ions and 85% of global sequence coverage. The sequence coverage of the nonreduced protein was significantly lower (around 16%); however, the analysis of the fragmentation spectra corroborated the presence of the intramolecular disulfide bridge along with the localization of the conjugation site. Altogether, our results pinpoint the difficulties and challenges associated with the fragmentation of sdAb-derived formats in the LC time scale due to their remarkable stability as a consequence of the intramolecular disulfide bridge.

Treatment of endothelial cells with lactate disrupts endothelial cell function and induces mesenchymal-like function following hypoxia by activating the TGF-\u03b2/Smad2 pathway. Mechanistically, lactate induces an association between CBP/p300 and Snail1, leading to lactylation of Snail1, a TGF-\u03b2 transcription factor, through lactate transporter monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)\u2013dependent signaling.

This study demonstrated that lactate accumulation in aortic tissues and blood is correlated with increased monocarboxylate transporter 1 (Mct1) expression in endothelial cells (ECs) within atherosclerotic plaques. Lactate uptake via Mct1 triggers an inflammatory response in ECs. The administration of endothelial\u2010targeting nanoparticles containing siRNA against Mct1 reduces endothelial inflammation and atherogenesis in Apoe\u2212/\u2212 mice. Mechanistic studies revealed that the conversion of lactate to pyruvate, along with NADH production and oligomerization of the NADH\u2010sensitive transcriptional corepressor C\u2010terminal binding protein 1 (CtBP1), is necessary for the proinflammatory effects of lactate. Monomeric CtBP1 interacts with the transcriptional repressor forkhead box P1 (FOXP1) to suppress endothelial adhesion molecule expression. However, NADH\u2010induced oligomerization of CtBP1 prevents its binding to FOXP1, significantly reducing FOXP1\u2010mediated transrepression of endothelial adhesion molecules. Moreover, silencing Foxp1 in ECs negates the atheroprotective effect of endothelial Mct1 knockdown in Apoe\u2212/\u2212 mice.

SUMMARY ANSWER The guideline development group (GDG) updated 11 existing recommendations on investigations and treatments for RPL, and how care should be organized, and added one new recommendation on adenomyosis investigation in women with RPL. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY A previous ESHRE guideline on RPL was published in 2017 and needs to be updated. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION The guideline was developed and updated according to the structured methodology for development and update of ESHRE guidelines. The literature searches were updated, and assessments of relevant new evidence were performed. Relevant papers published between 31 March 2017 and 28 February 2022 and written in English were included. Cumulative live birth rate, live birth rate, and pregnancy loss rate (or miscarriage rate) were considered the critical outcomes. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS Based on the collected evidence, recommendations were updated and discussed until consensus was reached within the GDG. A stakeholder review was organized after the updated draft was finalized. The final version was approved by the GDG and the ESHRE Executive Committee. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE The new version of the guideline provides 39 recommendations on risk factors, prevention, and investigation in couples with RPL, and 38 recommendations on treatments. These includes 62 evidence-based recommendations\u2014of which 33 were formulated as strong recommendations and 29 as conditional\u2014and 15 good practice points. Of the evidence-based recommendations, 12 (19.4%) were supported by moderate-quality evidence. The remaining recommendations were supported by low (34 recommendations; 54.8%), or very low-quality evidence (16 recommendations; 25.8%). Owing to the lack of evidence-based investigations and treatments in RPL care, the guideline also clearly mentions those investigations and treatments that should not be used for couples with RPL. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION The guidelines have been updated; however, several investigations and treatments currently offered to couples with RPL have not been well studied; for most of these investigations and treatments, a recommendation against using the intervention or treatment was formulated based on insufficient evidence. Future studies may require these recommendations to be revised. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS The guideline provides clinicians with clear advice on best practice in RPL, based on the best and most recent evidence available.

Design Prospective multicentre cohort study (Tommy's Net). Setting Three university hospital research centres in the United Kingdom. Population 1035 women with a baseline history of two or more miscarriages. Methods We analysed baseline dietary data from a 10\u2010item Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ). For individual food category analyses, we used multivariable Poisson regression following adjustment for maternal confounders and paternal dietary patterns. For whole diet analyses, ordinal principal component analysis (PCA) was used to identify common dietary patterns. Results were presented as relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and accompanying p\u2010values. Main Outcome Measures Miscarriage rate, defined as the rate of spontaneous pregnancy loss (<\u200924\u2009weeks of gestation) relative to the total number of pregnancies (miscarriages and live births). Results High consumption of fruit and nuts (almonds and walnuts) was associated with lower miscarriage risk (fruit 226/662 (34.1%) vs. 38/77 (49.4%), RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.85, p\u2009=\u20090.001; nuts 47/152 (30.9%) vs. 220/613 (35.9%), RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.98, p\u2009=\u20090.039). High red meat intake was associated with a possible increase in miscarriage risk (6/12 (50.0%) vs. 165/469 (35.2%), RR 1.86, 95% CI 1.10 to 3.16, p\u2009=\u20090.022). The association with miscarriage risk was unclear for other food groups, including fresh vegetables, white meat, fish, dairy, eggs, soya and chocolate, due to imprecise point estimates. Through PCA, we identified three data\u2010derived dietary patterns. Yet, no distinct relationship emerged between these dietary patterns and miscarriage risk.

CAC-717, a suspension of calcium bicarbonate mesoscopic structures derived from natural sources, has been shown to inactivate various pathogens, including prions. This study examined the effects of CAC-717 on both the formation and degradation/dissociation of A\u03b2 aggregates using thioflavin T fluorescence and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Aggregates of A\u03b2(1\u201342) peptide were generated by incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 24 h, and the effect of introducing CAC-717 on the aggregates was evaluated after further incubation at 25 \u00b0C for 30 min. Moreover, CAC-717 was also tested for its ability to inhibit the initial aggregation of A\u03b2. The results showed that CAC-717 significantly degraded and/or dissociated A\u03b2 aggregates in a concentration-dependent manner.

The systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) is a novel and integrated inflammatory biomarker that has not yet been linked to DKD. We aimed to identify the potential relationship between SII and DKD. Methods In the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) between 2011 and 2018, the current cross-sectional study was conducted among adults with T2DM. SII was calculated as the platelet count \u00d7 neutrophil count/lymphocyte count.

In this study, 90 T2DM patients and 90 non-diabetic subjects were recruited. Fasting and post-prandial blood samples were collected and used for the estimation of blood sugar, urea, creatinine, and lipid profile parameters. Whole blood (EDTA) samples were used for analysis of complete blood count (CBC) and HbA1c. NLR, PLR, SII, SIRI, MHR, NHR, LHR, and PHR were calculated from CBC values. Demographic details were collected.\nResults: In this study, significant increase in blood pressure (systolic [120.4\u00b18.1 mmHg], diastolic [80.2\u00b14.8 mmHg]), fasting blood sugar (FBS) (162.5\u00b153.7 mg/dL), post-prandial blood sugar (238.3\u00b178.8 mg/dL), HbA1c (8.5\u00b12.2%), urea (28.6\u00b18.6 mg/dL), creatinine (1.1\u00b10.2 mg/dL), total cholesterol (186.8\u00b146.1 mg/dL), triglycerides (168.9\u00b161.2 mg/dL), LDLC (115.0\u00b136.3 mg/dL), VLDL (33.8\u00b112.4 mg/dL), and neutrophil count (66.6\u00b111.4%) was observed in T2DM cases.

One example is the genus Faecalibacterium. Numerous studies have underscored that low levels of Faecalibacterium are correlated with inflammatory conditions, with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in the forefront. Its representation is also diminished in the case of several diseases, including colorectal cancer (CRC), dermatitis, and depression. Additionally, the relative presence of this genus is considered to reflect, at least in part, intestinal health status because Faecalibacterium is frequently present at reduced levels in individuals with gastrointestinal diseases or disorders. In this review, we first thoroughly describe updates to the taxonomy of Faecalibacterium, which has transformed a single-species taxon to a multispecies taxon over the last decade. We then explore the links discovered between Faecalibacterium abundance and various diseases since the first IBD-focused studies were published.

A total of 384 Jingfen No.6 laying hens aged 65 weeks were randomly divided into 4 treatments groups (6 replicates per group) and fed diets containing 0, 150, 300, or 600 mg kg\u22121 multi-enzyme over an 8-week feeding duration. Our findings revealed that supplementation with 600 mg kg\u22121 of multi-enzyme significantly increased the albumen height (P < 0.05) and haugh unit (P < 0.05). Moreover, as the levels of multi-enzyme supplementation in the diet increased, there were significant increases in activities of total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) in serum (P < 0.05) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in the liver (P < 0.05). Different levels of multi-enzyme supplementation significantly affected the composition of amino acid profiles in the yolk. Furthermore, the results from 16S rRNA sequencing and untargeted metabolomics analysis of cecal content revealed that multi-enzyme supplementation altered the cecal microflora and metabolite profiles. We found the relative abundance of the Bacteroidota phyla in T600 group was significantly increased (P < 0.05) compared to CON and T150 groups, but the relative abundance of the Firmicutes phylum in T600 group were significantly lower than T150 group (P < 0.05).

The KEGG pathway analysis showed that the common enrichment metabolic pathways of each treatment group compared to the CON group were glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, foxo signaling pathway and mTOR signaling pathway, and the enrichment metabolic pathways shared by T300 vs CON and T600 vs CON was galactose metabolism and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathways. Correlation analysis identified notable relationships between specific microbes and metabolites with T-AOC in serum, GSH-Px activity in the liver, amino acids in yolk, albumen height, and haugh units.

Mirvetuximab soravtansine (MIRV) is an antibody-drug conjugate targeting folate receptor \u03b1 (FR\u03b1). SORAYA is a single-arm, phase II study evaluating efficacy and safety of MIRV in patients with PROC. METHODS SORAYA enrolled FR\u03b1-high patients with PROC who had received one to three prior therapies, including required bevacizumab. The primary end point was confirmed objective response rate (ORR) by investigator; duration of response was the key secondary end point. RESULTS One hundred six patients were enrolled; 105 were evaluable for efficacy. All patients had received prior bevacizumab, 51% had three prior lines of therapy, and 48% received a prior poly ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitor. Median follow-up was 13.4 months. ORR was 32.4% (95% CI, 23.6 to 42.2), including five complete and 29 partial responses. The median duration of response was 6.9 months (95% CI, 5.6 to 9.7). In patients with one to two priors, the ORR by investigator was 35.3% (95% CI, 22.4 to 49.9) and in patients with three priors was 30.2% (95% CI, 18.3 to 44.3). The ORR by investigator was 38.0% (95% CI, 24.7 to 52.8) in patients with prior poly ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitor exposure and 27.5% (95% CI, 15.9 to 41.7) in those without. The most common treatment-related adverse events (all grade and grade 3-4) were blurred vision (41% and 6%), keratopathy (29% and 9%), and nausea (29% and 0%). Treatment-related adverse events led to dose delays, reductions, and discontinuations in 33%, 20%, and 9% of patients, respectively.

These challenges could be overcome by the development of simple, cost-effective, and long-lasting preventive nanocomposites for botanical pesticides. In this study, we successfully developed a low-cost ethyl cellulose (EC)-based delivery system for the botanical pesticide osthole (OST), designed to provide extended preventive protection against Tetranychus urticae infestations. A comparative analysis of the three nanocomposites (graphene oxide (GO)-OST, EC-OST, and chitosan (CS)-OST) revealed that EC-OST exhibited superior thermal stability, UV resistance, controlled release of the OST payload, and strong acaricidal activity. The degradation of OST on leaf surfaces was reduced by encapsulation in EC, while its penetration into plant tissues was improved. When EC-OST was applied to leaves, an increase in T. urticae mortality, a reduction in reproduction and egg adhesion, and impairment of feeding behavior through extended searching and feeding times were observed. The peak occurrence of T. urticae infestation was delayed by 10 days following the preventive application of EC-OST, reducing plant damage and protecting the plants for more than 20 days.

Primary tauopathies are characterized by pathological tau accumulation and neuronal and synaptic loss. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE)\u2013mediated neuroinflammation is involved in the progression of tau-mediated neurodegeneration, and emerging evidence suggests that the gut microbiota regulates neuroinflammation in an APOE genotype\u2013dependent manner. However, evidence of a causal link between the microbiota and tau-mediated neurodegeneration is lacking. In this study, we characterized a genetically engineered mouse model of tauopathy expressing human ApoE isoforms reared under germ-free conditions or after perturbation of their gut microbiota with antibiotics.

Description Microbiota and tau-mediated disease The accumulation of certain forms of the tau protein in the brain is linked to loss of nerve cells, inflammation, and cognitive decline in Alzheimer\u2019s disease and several other neurodegenerative diseases. Apolipoprotein-E (APOE), the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, regulates brain inflammation and tau-mediated brain damage; however, the gut microbiota also regulates brain inflammation. In a mouse model of tau-mediated brain injury, Seo et al. found that manipulation of the gut microbiota resulted in a strong reduction of inflammation, tau pathology, and brain damage in a sex- and APOE-dependent manner (see the Perspective by Jain and Li). \u2014SMH Manipulation of gut microbiota attenuates brain atrophy in a genetically engineered mouse model of tau-mediated neurodegeneration. INTRODUCTION Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is characterized by early deposition of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) plaques followed by pathological tau accumulation. Although A\u03b2 is a necessary factor in AD pathogenesis, its accumulation in and of itself is insufficient for neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. By contrast, pathological tau accumulation is closely linked with neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in AD and primary tauopathies. Alterations of the gut microbiota have been reported in AD, which suggests that the microbiota may contribute to AD progression. Animal studies to date have focused mainly on how gut microbiota alterations affect A\u03b2 pathology and not tauopathy and neurodegeneration. Additionally, recent studies have suggested that apolipoprotein E (ApoE) isoforms, which strongly influence AD risk and regulate tau-mediated neurodegeneration, differentially affect the gut microbiota. Therefore, further investigations to characterize the contribution of the gut microbiota to tauopathy and neurodegeneration are important. RATIONALE We assess the hypothesis that the gut microbiota regulates tau pathology and tau-mediated neurodegeneration in an ApoE isoform\u2013dependent manner. A mouse model of tauopathy (P301S tau transgenic mice) expressing human ApoE isoforms (ApoE3 and ApoE4), referred to as TE3 and TE4, was subjected to the manipulation of the gut microbiota using two approaches: (i) being raised in germ-free (GF) conditions and (ii) short-term antibiotic (ABX) treatment early in life. Animals were fed a standard mouse chow diet ad libitum until euthanasia at 40 weeks of age, when this mouse model typically has severe brain atrophy. RESULTS The gut microbiota manipulations resulted in a notable reduction of tau pathology and neurodegeneration in an ApoE isoform\u2013dependent manner. Both male and female GF TE4 mice showed a marked decrease in brain atrophy compared with conventionally raised (Conv-R) mice. Conv-R ABX-treated TE3 mice had significantly milder hippocampal atrophy compared with controls. ABX-treated TE4 animals showed trends of milder hippocampal atrophy, but the effect did not achieve statistical significance. These phenotypic effects of ABX treatment were not observed in females. Male GF TE4 mice and male ABX-treated TE3 mice showed significantly lower phosphorylated tau (p-tau) in the hippocampus compared with their controls. Astrocyte and microglial morphology and transcriptomic analysis revealed that the manipulation of the gut microbiota drives glial cells to a more homeostatic-like state, which indicates that gut microbiota strongly influence neuroinflammation and tau-mediated neurodegeneration. Microbiome and metabolite analysis suggests that microbially produced short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are mediators of the neuroinflammation-neurodegeneration axis. Supplementation of SCFAs to GF TE4 mice resulted in more reactive glial morphologies and gene expression as well as increased p-tau pathology. CONCLUSION The findings reveal mechanistic and translationally relevant interrelationships between the microbiota, the immune response, and tau-mediated neurodegeneration. ApoE-associated gut microbiota targeting may provide an avenue to further explore the prevention or treatment of AD and primary tauopathies. P301S tau transgenic mice expressing human APOE (TE mice). The dysregulated gut-brain axis and its effect on tauopathy and tau-mediated neurodegeneration. Dysbiosis, unbalanced gut microbiota composition (bottom center), contributes to tau-mediated neurodegeneration by generating bacterial metabolites (e.g., SCFAs) that influence peripheral immune cells. These cells promote central nervous system (CNS) inflammation and contribute to tau aggregation and neurodegeneration. Short-term antibiotics (bottom right) or germ-free conditions (bottom left) reshape or eliminate gut microbiota and reduce their metabolites.

To address this limitation, we propose an orthogonal approach to achieve generalization.

As for other types of tumors, such as colorectal cancer, aberrant de novo lipid synthesis and reprogrammed lipid metabolism have been suggested to be associated with PDAC development and progression. AIM To identify the possible involvement of lipid metabolism in PDAC by analyzing in tumoral and non-tumoral tissues the expression level of the most relevant genes involved in the long-chain fatty acid (FA) import into cell. METHODS A gene expression analysis of FASN, CD36, SLC27A1, SLC27A2, SLC27A3, SLC27A4, SLC27A5, ACSL1, and ACSL3 was performed by qRT-PCR in 24 tumoral PDAC tissues and 11 samples from non-tumoral pancreatic tissues obtained via fine needle aspiration or via surgical resection. The genes were considered significantly dysregulated between the groups when the p value was < 0.05 and the fold change (FC) was \u2264 0.5 and \u2265 2. RESULTS We found that three FA transporters and two long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases genes were significantly upregulated in the PDAC tissue compared to the non-tumoral tissue: SLC27A2 (FC = 5.66; P = 0.033), SLC27A3 (FC = 2.68; P = 0.040), SLC27A4 (FC = 3.13; P = 0.033), ACSL1 (FC = 4.10; P < 0.001), and ACSL3 (FC = 2.67; P = 0.012). We further investigated any possible association between the levels of the analyzed mRNAs and the specific characteristics of the tumors, including the anatomic location, the lymph node involvement, and the presence of metastasis. A significant difference in the expression of SLC27A3 (FC = 3.28; P = 0.040) was found comparing patients with and without lymph nodes involvement with an overexpression of this transcript in 17 patients presenting tumoral cells in the lymph nodes. CONCLUSION Despite the low number of patients analyzed, these preliminary results seem to be promising.

Antiviral treatments are often associated with the development of drug-resistant viruses. ABSTRACT The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (3CLpro) has an indispensable role in the viral life cycle and is a therapeutic target for the treatment of COVID-19. The potential of 3CLpro-inhibitors to select for drug-resistant variants needs to be established. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 was passaged in vitro in the presence of increasing concentrations of ALG-097161, a probe compound designed in the context of a 3CLpro drug discovery program. We identified a combination of amino acid substitutions in 3CLpro (L50F E166A L167F) that is associated with\u2009a >20\u00d7 increase in 50% effective concentration (EC50) values for ALG-097161, nirmatrelvir (PF-07321332), PF-00835231, and ensitrelvir. While two of the single substitutions (E166A and L167F) provide low-level resistance to the inhibitors in a biochemical assay, the triple mutant results in the highest levels of resistance (6\u00d7 to 72\u00d7). All substitutions are associated with a significant loss of enzymatic 3CLpro activity, suggesting a reduction in viral fitness. Structural biology analysis indicates that the different substitutions reduce the number of inhibitor/enzyme interactions while the binding of the substrate is maintained. These observations will be important for the interpretation of resistance development to 3CLpro inhibitors in the clinical setting. IMPORTANCE Paxlovid is the first oral antiviral approved for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Antiviral treatments are often associated with the development of drug-resistant viruses. In order to guide the use of novel antivirals, it is essential to understand the risk of resistance development and to characterize the associated changes in the viral genes and proteins. In this work, we describe for the first time a pathway that allows SARS-CoV-2 to develop resistance against Paxlovid in vitro. The characteristics of in vitro antiviral resistance development may be predictive for the clinical situation.

As a catalytically active dimer, its dimerization interface has become an attractive target for antiviral drug development. Recent research has extensively investigated the enzymatic activity of Mpro, focusing on its role in regulating the coronavirus replication complex and its significance in virus maturation and infectivity. Computational investigations have identified four druggable pockets, suggesting potential allosteric sites beyond the substrate-binding region. Empirical validation through site-directed alanine mutagenesis has targeted residues in both the active and allosteric regions and corroborated these predictions. Structural studies of drug target proteins can inform therapeutic approaches, with metadynamics simulations shedding light on the role of H163 in regulating Mpro function and providing insights into its dynamic equilibrium to the wild-type enzyme. Despite the efficacy of vaccines and drugs in mitigating SARS-CoV-2 spread, its ongoing viral evolution, selective pressures, and continued transmission pose challenges, potentially leading to resistant mutations. Phylogenetic analyses have indicated the existence of several resistant variations predating drug introduction to the human population, emphasizing the likelihood of drug spread. Hydrogen/deuterium-exchange mass spectrometry reveals the structural influence of the mutation.

Since vitamin D deficiency was shown to be among the risk factors for many diseases and for all-cause mortality, concern about this problem led us to update the previous Polish recommendations. Methods: After reviewing the epidemiological evidence, case-control studies and randomized control trials (RCTs), a Polish multidisciplinary group formulated questions on the recommendations for prophylaxis and treatment of vitamin D deficiency both for the general population and for the risk groups of patients. The scientific evidence of pleiotropic effects of vitamin D as well as the results of panelists\u2019 voting were reviewed and discussed. Thirty-four authors representing different areas of expertise prepared position statements. The consensus group, representing eight Polish/international medical societies and eight national specialist consultants, prepared the final Polish recommendations. Results: Based on networking discussions, the ranges of total serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration indicating vitamin D deficiency [<20 ng/mL (<50 nmol/L)], suboptimal status [20\u201330 ng/mL (50\u201375 nmol/L)], and optimal concentration [30\u201350 ng/mL (75\u2013125 nmol/L)] were confirmed. Practical guidelines for cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) as the first choice for prophylaxis and treatment of vitamin D deficiency were developed.

Therefore, the primary objective of any effective treatment is to intercept the disease process in its presymptomatic phases.

The limitations of these anti-AD treatments have stimulated the search for multi-target (MT) drugs. In recent years, more than 1000 drugs with potential MT function have been studied in AD models. MT drugs aim to address the complex and multifactorial nature of the disease. This approach has the potential to offer more comprehensive benefits than single-target therapies, which may be limited in their effectiveness due to the intricate pathology of AD.

By developing and refining prompt-based strategies, we can significantly enhance the models\u2019 performance, making them viable tools for clinical NER tasks and possibly reducing the reliance on extensive annotated datasets. Objectives This study quantifies the capabilities of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 for clinical named entity recognition (NER) tasks and proposes task-specific prompts to improve their performance. Materials and Methods We evaluated these models on 2 clinical NER tasks: (1) to extract medical problems, treatments, and tests from clinical notes in the MTSamples corpus, following the 2010 i2b2 concept extraction shared task, and (2) to identify nervous system disorder-related adverse events from safety reports in the vaccine adverse event reporting system (VAERS). To improve the GPT models' performance, we developed a clinical task-specific prompt framework that includes (1) baseline prompts with task description and format specification, (2) annotation guideline-based prompts, (3) error analysis-based instructions, and (4) annotated samples for few-shot learning. We assessed each prompt's effectiveness and compared the models to BioClinicalBERT. Results Using baseline prompts, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 achieved relaxed F1 scores of 0.634, 0.804 for MTSamples and 0.301, 0.593 for VAERS. Additional prompt components consistently improved model performance. When all 4 components were used, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 achieved relaxed F1 socres of 0.794, 0.861 for MTSamples and 0.676, 0.736 for VAERS, demonstrating the effectiveness of our prompt framework. Although these results trail BioClinicalBERT (F1 of 0.901 for the MTSamples dataset and 0.802 for the VAERS), it is very promising considering few training samples are needed. Discussion The study\u2019s findings suggest a promising direction in leveraging LLMs for clinical NER tasks. However, while the performance of GPT models improved with task-specific prompts, there's a need for further development and refinement. LLMs like GPT-4 show potential in achieving close performance to state-of-the-art models like BioClinicalBERT, but they still require careful prompt engineering and understanding of task-specific knowledge. The study also underscores the importance of evaluation schemas that accurately reflect the capabilities and performance of LLMs in clinical settings.

Interestingly, using genome-wide association study (GWAS) technology, many polymorphisms associated with LOAD have been identified. This review aims to analyze the new genetic findings that are closely related to the pathophysiology of AD.

Circulating immune cells reside in special niches in the brain\u2019s borders, the choroid plexus, meninges, and perivascular spaces, from which they patrol and sense the brain in a remote manner. These niches, together with the meningeal lymphatic system and skull microchannels, provide multiple routes of interaction between the brain and the immune system, in addition to the blood vasculature. In this Review, we describe current ideas about brain immunity and their implications for brain aging, diseases, and immune-based therapeutic approaches. Description Changing ideas about brain immunity Our understanding of how the brain and immune system interact has changed substantially over the past years and decades. Initially, the brain was thought to be immune privileged and isolated from the rest of the body. In a Review, Castellani et al. discuss recent discoveries, including attribution of central nervous system immune surveillance to tissue-resident microglia and acknowledging the existence of a complex brain-immune network that involves multiple peripheral immunological players. This complex brain-immune relationship is important during development, adulthood, and aging, as well as during various pathologies. Rethinking brain immunity could reveal new therapeutic targets for various neurological disorders. \u2014GKA A review discusses the current perception of brain immunity and its implications for brain aging, diseases, and immune-based therapies. BACKGROUND Beginning in the early 19th century, the brain was considered a self-contained organ behind barriers and thus as \u201cimmune privileged.\u201d This assumption was supported by experiments showing that a dye injected into the circulation did not stain the brain and by evidence of prolonged survival of tissue grafts in the brain compared with transplants into peripheral tissues. These conclusions led to the axiomatic view that the brain cannot tolerate any immune activity. The identification of brain-resident immune cells, the microglia, was often used as an additional argument to support the immunological self-sufficiency of the brain. In addition, despite the early description of brain lymphatic drainage, which dates back to 1787, the supposed absence of lymphatic vessels within the brain was, until recently, among the most common rationales used to support the view of a complete separation between the brain and the immune system. ADVANCES Our perception of the relationship between the brain and the immune system has completely changed over the past decades. It is now established that immune cells operate as guardians of the central nervous system (CNS), support brain function and repair, and reside in specialized immunological niches at its borders, including the meninges, the choroid plexus, and the perivascular spaces. The meninges remotely affect the brain through immune cell\u2013derived cytokine release. The choroid plexus hosts and orchestrates the selective homing of immune cells to the CNS parenchyma. The perivascular spaces are populated by immune cells regulating cerebrospinal fluid flow. The demonstration of the CNS lymphatic system and brain drainage led to the identification of the brain-draining cervical lymph nodes as crucial supplementary sites of the interaction between the CNS and the immune system. Additional observations revealed that microscopic channels in the bone of the skull allow exposure of the bone marrow (BM) to the cerebrospinal fluid, thereby influencing cellular maturation in the BM and migration into the brain. Such an intricate communication network guarantees efficient CNS-monitoring activities by neighboring immune cells, the phenotype of which is shaped by the CNS microenvironment to which they are constantly exposed. The bidirectional nature of the CNS\u2013immune system interplay is supported by emerging studies demonstrating the ability of neuronal cells to modulate the immune response through lymphoid organ innervation in the context of CNS diseases. OUTLOOK The negative side of the immune system participating in brain physiology is that imbalanced brain-immune interactions might be critical in aging and in autoimmune, neurodegenerative, and neurodevelopmental disorders. Under such conditions, the perturbed brain microenvironment might lead to a harmful immune response, which may exacerbate disease manifestations. Further advances in our understanding of brain immunity and the reciprocal ability of the CNS and the immune system to sense and influence each other will offer intervention tools for the design of new therapeutic strategies for treating brain pathologies. Understanding what goes awry in each of the brain\u2019s immune niches, including the skull BM, the meninges, and the choroid plexus, as well as in lymphatic drainage, might reveal new potential targets for therapeutic approaches in the near future.

Excessive generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) leads to a state of oxidative stress which is a major risk factor for the development and progression of atherosclerosis. ROS are important for maintaining vascular health through their potent signalling properties. However, ROS also activate pro-atherogenic processes such as inflammation, endothelial dysfunction and altered lipid metabolism. As such, considerable efforts have been made to identify and characterise sources of oxidative stress in blood vessels. Major enzymatic sources of vascular ROS include NADPH oxidases, xanthine oxidase, nitric oxide synthases and mitochondrial electron transport chains. The production of ROS is balanced by ROS-scavenging antioxidant systems which may become dysfunctional in disease, contributing to oxidative stress. Changes in the expression and function of ROS sources and antioxidants have been observed in human atherosclerosis while in vitro and in vivo animal models have provided mechanistic insight into their functions. There is considerable interest in utilising antioxidant molecules to balance vascular oxidative stress, yet clinical trials are yet to demonstrate any atheroprotective effects of these molecules.

The human cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection has significant impacts on monocyte effector functions and gene expression. CMV, a \u03b2-herpesvirus, disrupts key monocyte roles, including phagocytosis, antigen presentation, cytokine production, and migration, impairing their ability to combat pathogens and activate adaptive immune responses. CMV modulates monocyte gene expression, decreasing their capacity for antigen presentation and phagocytosis while increasing pro-inflammatory cytokine production, which can contribute to tissue damage and chronic inflammation. CMV also alters monocyte migration to sites of infection while promoting trans-endothelial migration, thus aiding viral dissemination. Additionally, the virus affects reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, thereby contributing to end-organ disease associated with CMV infection. Overall, these changes enhance viral persistence during acute infection and facilitate immune evasion during latency.

Therefore, measurable biomarkers in blood are needed to define the presence and severity of atherosclerotic plaque in patients to identify and manage it.

For this purpose, the levels of participants\u2019 inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers were determined. Kynurenine/tryptophan and neopterin levels were measured as relatively new biomarkers of inflammation in this study. Methods: Our study included 57 patients diagnosed with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis and 28 healthy volunteers. Blood kynurenine and tryptophan levels were measured with LCMS/MS. Blood catalase, total superoxide dismutase (t-SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), malondialdehyde, and neopterin levels were measured using the ELISA assay method. Result: The kynurenine/tryptophan ratio reflecting IDO activity was higher in patients than in healthy volunteers. Decreased tryptophan levels and increased kynurenine and neopterin levels were observed in patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy. In patients, catalase, t-SOD, and malondialdehyde levels were higher, while GPx activity was lower. These differences were found to be more significant in patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy.

As of April 2023, six CAR T cell therapies have been approved, demonstrating unprecedented efficacy in patients with B-cell malignancies and multiple myeloma. However, adverse events such as cytokine release syndrome and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity pose significant challenges to CAR T cell therapy. The severity of these adverse events correlates with the pretreatment tumor burden, where a higher tumor burden results in more severe consequences. This observation is supported by the application of CD19-targeted CAR T cell therapy in autoimmune diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus and antisynthetase syndrome. These results indicate that initiating CAR T cell therapy early at low tumor burden or using debulking strategy prior to CAR T cell infusion may reduce the severity of adverse events. In addition, CAR T cell therapy is expensive and has limited effectiveness against solid tumors.

The postnatal period, defined as the period immediately following the birth of the newborn to 6 weeks (42 days) after birth, is a critical time for women, newborns, parents, caregivers and families. Postnatal care services are an essential element of the maternal and newborn care continuum. The care provided during this period contributes to improved maternal and child health and wellbeing by helping to establish healthy practices, prevent disease, and detect and manage complications. It is key to foster an environment that supports the health, social and developmental needs of the woman, newborn and family unit. Yet, coverage and quality of postnatal care lag substantially behind that of both antenatal and intrapartum care, and marked inequities in the use of postnatal care persist. In line with the Sustainable Development Goals and the Global Strategy for Women Children and Adolescent Health, and in accordance with a human rightsbased approach, there is a need to broaden the objective of postnatal care to improving quality, not solely coverage and survival. The WHO has responded to the evolving global maternal, newborn and child health agenda with comprehensive guidelines to improve maternal and newborn care, with particular focus on quality of care; that is, both provision and experience of care within the health system, to support all women, newborns and families to thrive in the short term and longer term.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-01-01", "synthetic_support_claim": "The postnatal period is critical for establishing healthy practices and preventing disease in newborns.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Postnatal care services directly reduce the incidence of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) in newborns."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "ad629bef5e5acd8f8f83a7863335be6b1f118887", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ad629bef5e5acd8f8f83a7863335be6b1f118887", "title": "Cross sectional survey of maternal and newborn quality of care in Niger: Selected findings, lessons learned and recommendations", "abstract": "Comprehensive assessments of quality of care (QoC) are essential for monitoring progress towards meeting global and national maternal and newborn health (MNH) targets.

Methods A community-based cross-sectional mixed study design was conducted among mothers who gave birth within the past six months, from April to May 2023. Quantitative data was collected through structured interview questionnaires from 312 randomly selected mothers. The collected data was coded, cleaned, and entered into Epi-info version 7.2.5.0, and analyzed using SPSS version 26.

Metalloregulatory proteins, which sense specific metal ions with high affinity and specificity, play a critical role in immune regulation. Here, we screened various bioactive metal ions associated with metalloregulatory proteins and discovered that Zn2+ and Mn2+ effectively suppressed M1 polarization. Based on these findings, mildly alkaline ZnMn-based layered double hydroxides (ZnMn-LDHs) self-assembled from Zn2+ coordinated with Mn2+ were developed to inhibit M1-like macrophages. ZnMn-LDHs effectively neutralized the acidic environment and promoted the expression of metalloregulatory proteins, including metallothionein (MT), superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), thereby eliciting robust M1-like macrophage inhibition. More importantly, nerve growth factor (NGF) released by macrophages following the regulation by ZnMn-LDHs promoted the elongation and spreading of Schwann cells. By integrating ZnMn-LDHs with silk fibroin (SF), ZnMn@SF injectable hydrogels were constructed for SCI repair.

Methods This retrospective, cross-sectional study was conducted in 20 tertiary centers in T\u00fcrkiye between October 2021 and March 2022, among 1425 PLWH aged 40-75 years. About 82.7% were male, with a median age of 51. Web-based tools for each score were used for CVD risk calculations.

This review investigates how HIV and ART contribute to vascular endothelial dysfunction, myocardial fibrosis, and hypercoagulation, which significantly exacerbate cardiovascular risk. Mechanistic insights include chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation due to persistent HIV infection and ART-specific effects such as protease inhibitors causing dyslipidemia and zidovudine inducing mitochondrial toxicity leading to cardiomyopathy. ART, while lifesaving, has been implicated in promoting subclinical atherosclerosis and increasing the risk of acute myocardial infarction, further highlighting the need for tailored approaches. The manuscript addresses pressing obstacles, including disparities in healthcare access and the lack of standardized cardiovascular screening guidelines specific to PLWH. It emphasizes the integration of advanced imaging techniques and emerging biomarkers, such as coronary artery calcium scoring and soluble ST2, to detect early subclinical cardiovascular abnormalities. The review also identifies challenges in ART selection to balance virologic control and cardiovascular safety. What sets this review apart is its holistic and detailed approach to the intersection of HIV and cardiovascular health. It not only elucidates complex pathophysiological mechanisms but also offers actionable insights into how current clinical guidelines fall short. This manuscript underscores the urgency of implementing proactive cardiovascular screening protocols tailored for PLWH and refining ART regimens to mitigate CVD risks. By addressing these gaps, this work aims to expand our understanding of HIV-related cardiovascular manifestations and provide a foundation for targeted interventions, thereby improving long-term health outcomes for PLWH.

PURPOSE The phase III ADAURA (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02511106) primary analysis demonstrated a clinically significant disease-free survival (DFS) benefit with adjuvant osimertinib versus placebo in EGFR-mutated stage IB-IIIA non\u2013small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after complete tumor resection (DFS hazard ratio [HR], 0.20 [99.12% CI, 0.14 to 0.30]; P < .001). We report an updated exploratory analysis of final DFS data. METHODS Overall, 682 patients with stage IB-IIIA (American Joint Committee on Cancer/Union for International Cancer Control, seventh edition) EGFR-mutated (exon 19 deletion/L858R) NSCLC were randomly assigned 1:1 (stratified by stage, mutational status, and race) to receive osimertinib 80 mg once-daily or placebo for 3 years. The primary end point was DFS by investigator assessment in stage II-IIIA disease analyzed by stratified log-rank test; following early reporting of statistical significance in DFS, no further formal statistical testing was planned. Secondary end points included DFS in stage IB-IIIA, overall survival, and safety. Patterns of recurrence and CNS DFS were prespecified exploratory end points. RESULTS At data cutoff (April 11, 2022), in stage II-IIIA disease, median follow-up was 44.2 months (osimertinib) and 19.6 months (placebo); the DFS HR was 0.23 (95% CI, 0.18 to 0.30); 4-year DFS rate was 70% (osimertinib) and 29% (placebo). In the overall population, DFS HR was 0.27 (95% CI, 0.21 to 0.34); 4-year DFS rate was 73% (osimertinib) and 38% (placebo). Fewer patients treated with osimertinib had local/regional and distant recurrence versus placebo. CNS DFS HR in stage II-IIIA was 0.24 (95% CI, 0.14 to 0.42). The long-term safety profile of osimertinib was consistent with the primary analysis.

Sulfatase 1 (SULF1) is an extracellular neutral sulfatase and is involved in multiple physiological processes. Hence, this study investigated the function and possible mechanisms of SULF1 in NSCLC. Material and Methods: Difference in SULF1 expression level between tumors and normal lung tissues was analyzed through bioinformatics and clinical sampling, and the effects of SULF1 expression on prognosis were investigated through Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis. SULF1 level in NSCLC cells was modulated through small interfering ribonucleic acid interference. NSC228155, which is an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway agonist, was for handling NSCLC cells. SULF1 expression level was tested through quantitative reverse transcriptase real-time polymerase chain reaction. Cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were evaluated with cell counting kit-8, 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine, and transwell assays, and the levels of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)- and EGFR/MAPK pathway-related proteins were detected through Western blot. Results: Bioinformatics and clinical samples showed that NSCLC tumor tissues had elevated SULF1 expression levels relative to those of normal tissues (P < 0.05). Patients with NSCLC and high SULF1 expression levels experienced poorer prognosis than those of low SULF1 expression levels (P < 0.05). SULF1 knockdown repressed the malignant biological behavior, including proliferation, migration, and invasion, of the NSCLC cells (P < 0.05). Mechanistically, SULF1 knockdown augmented E-cadherin level and abated N-cadherin and vimentin protein levels (P < 0.05). These results confirmed that EMT was inhibited. In addition, the knockdown of SULF1 reduced the phosphorylation of EGFR, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, p38 MAPK and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and NSC228155 partially reversed these changes, which were affected by SULF1 knockdown. Meanwhile, NSC228155 partially reversed the inhibition of EMT, migration, and invasion affected by SULF1 knockdown.

Surgical treatment remains the most applicable curative option, especially in the early stages of the disease, adjuvant chemotherapy may add benefits to previously resected patients. Combined Radio-chemotherapy can also be used for palliative purposes. There are various future perspectives and advancing horizons in NSCLC management, encompassing novel therapeutic modalities and their applications, such as CAR-T cell therapy, antibody-drug conjugates, and gene therapies. On the other hand, it\u2019s crucial to highlight the efficacy of innovative modalities of Immunotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors that are nowadays widely used in treatment of NSCLC. Moreover, the latest advancements in molecular profiling techniques and the development of targeted therapies designed for specific molecular alterations in NSCLC play a significant role in its treatment. In conclusion, personalized approaches are a cornerstone of successful treatment, and they are based on a patient\u2019s unique molecular profile, tumor characteristics, and host factors.

The task force consisted of 24 physicians, health professionals and patients from 14 countries. The recommendations were updated based on evidence and expert opinion, iterating until voting indicated consensus. The level of agreement was determined by anonymous votes.

As an alternative to ultrasound, cranial and extracranial arteries can be examined by FDG-PET or MRI. For Takayasu arteritis, MRI is the preferred imaging modality; FDG-PET, CT or ultrasound are alternatives. Although imaging is not routinely recommended for follow-up, ultrasound, FDG-PET or MRI may be used for assessing vessel abnormalities in LVV patients with suspected relapse, particularly when laboratory markers of inflammation are unreliable.

An increasing number of studies have focused on the ecological significance of secondary metabolites in plant parts, especially in pollen. Ericaceae species exhibit significant morphological variations and diverse colors, are widely distributed throughout China and are popular ornamental garden plants. The chemical trait of pollen in Ericaceae species and their potential ecological significance remain unclear. We selected a total of nine Ericaceae species from three nature reserves in southwestern China, which were the predominant flowering Ericaceae plants for each site, and measured their floral characteristics, nectar volume and sugar concentration. We determined the types of pollinators of these species based on a literature review and used UPLC-QTOF-MS to analyze the types and relative contents of primary metabolites (amino acids and fatty acids) and secondary metabolites (terpenoids, phenolics and nitrogenous compounds) in the pollen and other tissues, including the stems, leaves, petals and nectar. The results showed that each species exhibited unique floral characteristics. Enkianthus ruber, Pieris formosa, Rhododendron agastum, R. irroratum, R. virgatum and R. rubiginosum were pollinated by bees, and R. delavayi, R. decorum and R. excellens were pollinated by diverse animals (bees, birds and Lepidoptera). The pollen of these Ericaceae species was rich in phenolics and terpenoids, especially flavonoids. Grayanotoxin, andromedotoxin and asebotin (toxic diterpene compounds) were also detected in the pollen of some of the Ericaceae species in our study, and their response value was low. The relative contents and diversity of secondary metabolites in the pollen were higher than those in the nectar but lower than those in the leaves, petals and stems. The five chemical compounds with the highest content (four flavonoids, one triterpene) in the pollen were also detected in the stems, leaves and petals, and the response value of most of these chemicals in pollen was not significantly correlated with that in other tissues. Rhododendron species has a closer relationship with chemical traits in pollen compared with Enkianthus and Pieris species. The response value of total secondary metabolites in the pollen of species pollinated only by bees was higher than that of species pollinated by diverse animals.

Current clinical therapies for AR include antihistamines, glucocorticoids administered via various routes, leukotriene receptor antagonists, immunotherapy, and several decongestants. These treatments have demonstrated efficacy in alleviating clinical symptoms and pathological states. However, with the growing awareness of AR and rising expectations for improvements in quality of life, these treatments have become associated with a higher incidence of side effects and an elevated risk of drug resistance. Furthermore, the development of AR is intricately associated with dysregulation of the immune system, yet the underlying pathogenetic mechanisms remain incompletely understood. In contrast, widely available natural plant molecules offer multiple targeting pathways that uniquely modify the typical pathophysiology of AR through immunomodulatory processes. This review presents a comprehensive analysis of both in vivo and in vitro studies on natural plant molecules that modulate immunity for treating AR.

METHODS Adults with stage IV/recurrent non\u2013small-cell lung cancer without EGFR mutations or ALK alterations and with tumor PD-L1 \u2265 1% or < 1% (n = 1739) were randomly assigned. Patients with tumor PD-L1 \u2265 1% were randomly assigned to first-line nivolumab plus ipilimumab, nivolumab alone, or chemotherapy. Patients with tumor PD-L1 < 1% were randomly assigned to nivolumab plus ipilimumab, nivolumab plus chemotherapy, or chemotherapy. End points included exploratory 5-year results for efficacy, safety, and quality of life. RESULTS At a minimum follow-up of 61.3 months, 5-year OS rates were 24% versus 14% for nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus chemotherapy (PD-L1 \u2265 1%) and 19% versus 7% (PD-L1 < 1%). The median duration of response was 24.5 versus 6.7 months (PD-L1 \u2265 1%) and 19.4 versus 4.8 months (PD-L1 < 1%). Among patients surviving 5 years, 66% (PD-L1 \u2265 1%) and 64% (PD-L1 < 1%) were off nivolumab plus ipilimumab without initiating subsequent systemic anticancer treatment by the 5-year time point. Survival benefit continued after nivolumab plus ipilimumab discontinuation because of treatment-related adverse events, with a 5-year OS rate of 39% (combined PD-L1 \u2265 1% and < 1% populations). Quality of life in 5-year survivors treated with nivolumab plus ipilimumab was similar to that in the general US population through the 5-year follow-up. No new safety signals were observed. CONCLUSION With all patients off immunotherapy treatment for \u2265 3 years, nivolumab plus ipilimumab increased 5-year survivorship versus chemotherapy, including long-term, durable clinical benefit regardless of tumor PD-L1 expression.

A total of 90 patients with MBC, treated with ICI-based therapy, with different treatment lines, were included in the present study. The median age was 50 years (range, 27\u201376). The predominant tumor subtypes were triple negative (53.3%) and luminal (31.1%) breast cancer. The majority of patients (61.1%) were heavily pretreated (lines of treatment, \u22653). Approximately half of the patients (46.7%) had \u22653 metastatic sites. The overall ORR was 36.7% (33/90 patients), while a DCR of 78.9% (71/90 patients) was also recorded.

Objective: To longitudinally examine plasma markers of neurodegeneration (neurofilament light chain; NfL) and tau pathology (phosphorylated at threonine 181; p-tau181) and their associations with apathy and affective symptoms in individuals with clinical diagnoses of AD dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Design, Setting, Participants and Exposure: This cohort study used longitudinal data from the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Individuals with clinical diagnoses of MCI and AD dementia were enrolled in ADNI with serial annual blood samples over a four-year period, which were analyzed for NfL and p-tau181 using ultrasensitive techniques. Study data were accessed between July and September 2024. Main Outcomes and Measures: The presence of neuropsychiatric symptoms was determined using the Neuropsychiatric Interview (NPI). We analyzed the trajectory of plasma NfL and p-tau181 in each NPS using general linear mixed-effects models adjusted for age and sex. Results: There were 790 participants with AD dementia and MCI (mean [SD] age 72.7 [7.6] years; 333 females, 42%) and 417 healthy controls. The most common NPS was depression (n = 428; 54%), followed by irritability (n = 419; 53%), apathy (n = 348; 44%) and anxiety (n = 341; 43%). In the AD dementia and MCI group, apathy and anxiety were associated with higher levels of both NfL and p-tau181 after controlling for cognitive and functional decline. Moreover, apathy was associated with higher rate of NfL increase longitudinally. Depression at baseline was initially associated with higher NfL and p-tau181 levels, but this did not remain significant in the sensitivity analyses. Conclusion and Relevance: This study found that in individuals with clinical AD, apathy and anxiety are associated greater tau and neurodegenerative burden. Furthermore, those with apathy had a higher rate of NfL increase, which suggests an accelerated neurodegenerative process.

Eligibility criteria Trials that randomised adults (\u226518 years) with long covid to drug or non-drug interventions, placebo or sham, or usual care. Results 24 trials with 3695 patients were eligible. Four trials (n=708 patients) investigated drug interventions, eight (n=985) physical activity or rehabilitation, three (n=314) behavioural, four (n=794) dietary, four (n=309) medical devices and technologies, and one (n=585) a combination of physical exercise and mental health rehabilitation.

Several trials that study the benefits and harms of various interventions to manage long COVID have been published and hundreds more are planned or are ongoing. Trustworthy systematic reviews that clarify the benefits and harms of interventions are critical to promote evidence-based practice. Objective To create and maintain a living systematic review and network meta-analysis addressing the benefits and harms of pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions for the treatment and management of long COVID. Methods Eligible trials will randomise adults with long COVID to pharmacologic or non-pharmacologic interventions, placebo, sham or usual care. We will identify eligible studies by searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, AMED and CENTRAL from inception, without language restrictions. Reviewers will work independently and in duplicate to screen search records, collect data from eligible trials, including trial and patient characteristics and outcomes of interest and assess risk of bias. Our outcomes of interest will include patient-reported fatigue, pain, postexertional malaise, changes in education or employment status, cognitive function, mental health, dyspnoea, quality of life, physical function, recovery and serious adverse events. For each outcome, when possible, we will perform a frequentist random-effects network meta-analysis. When there are compelling reasons to suspect that certain interventions are only applicable or effective for a subtype of long COVID, we will perform separate network meta-analyses. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach will guide our assessment of the certainty of evidence. We will update our living review biannually, on the publication of a seminal trial, or when new evidence emerges that may change clinical practice. Conclusion This living systematic review and network meta-analysis will provide comprehensive, trustworthy and up-to-date summaries of the evidence addressing the benefits and harms of interventions for the treatment and management of long COVID. We will make our findings available publicly and work with guideline-producing organisations to inform their recommendations.

Colistin is a \u2018Reserve\u2019 antibiotic for human treatment to be conserved for multidrug-resistant pathogens; however, it is being used as an animal growth promoter in many developing countries. The evolution of mobilized colistin resistance (mcr) gene-mediated colistin resistance has been reported to be associated with rampant colistin use. This study investigated the current variants of the mcr gene in chicken gut contents in Bangladesh. A cross-sectional study was designed to assess the mcr-1 to mcr-5 genes in 80 fresh poultry droppings from commercial poultry farms and 40 poultry droppings from household farms. DNA was extracted from each poultry dropping using commercial kits (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany). Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was employed using the qTOWER3 thermal cycler (Analytik Jena GmbH, Jena, Germany) to analyze the mcr gene variants in the extracted DNA. This study observed that 47.5% (57/120) of the samples exhibited the presence of at least one mcr gene out of the five variants investigated.

Overall, a significantly higher number of mcr genes were identified in the commercial farm chicken droppings compared to the household chicken droppings (p = 0.007). The existence of mcr genes in poultry feces in Bangladesh emphasizes the importance of proper poultry waste disposal and good hygiene practices in poultry livestock and its value chain.

In 2019, the JYNNEOS vaccine was approved for subcutaneous administration (0.5 ml per dose) to prevent mpox infection. On August 9, 2022, an emergency use authorization was issued for intradermal administration (0.1 ml per dose); however, real-world effectiveness data are limited for either route.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a case-control study based on data from Cosmos, a nationwide Epic electronic health record (EHR) database, to assess the effectiveness of JYNNEOS vaccination in preventing medically attended mpox disease among adults. Case patients had an mpox diagnosis code or positive orthopoxvirus or mpox virus laboratory result, and control patients had an incident diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or a new or refill order for preexposure prophylaxis against HIV infection between August 15, 2022, and November 19, 2022. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated from conditional logistic-regression models, adjusted for confounders; vaccine effectiveness was calculated as (1\u2009-\u2009odds ratio for vaccination in case patients vs. controls)\u2009\u00d7\u2009100.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAmong 2193 case patients and 8319 control patients, 25 case patients and 335 control patients received two doses (full vaccination), among whom the estimated adjusted vaccine effectiveness was 66.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 47.4 to 78.1), and 146 case patients and 1000 control patients received one dose (partial vaccination), among whom the estimated adjusted vaccine effectiveness was 35.8% (95% CI, 22.1 to 47.1).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn this study using nationwide EHR data, patients with mpox were less likely to have received one or two doses of JYNNEOS vaccine than control patients.

The aim of this review is to describe pathogens which are not traditionally defined as STIs, to grant insight on current and potential outbreaks and call for clinical vigilance among members of key populations.\n\n\nRECENT FINDINGS\nRecent findings emphasize that several pathogens, not traditionally classified as STIs, can be sexually transmissible. These include the mpox virus, enteric infections such as Shigella spp., dermatophytes such as Trichophyton mentagrophytes, ectoparasites and atypical bacterial genito-urinary infections such as Neisseria meningitidis. The internationally reported outbreaks and the reports on potential sexual transmission of these pathogens underlines the emerging risks, the need for a broader STI definition and the importance of vigilant public health control strategies.\n\n\nSUMMARY\nThese findings suggest that clinical practice should broaden STI testing and awareness to include pathogens not traditionally considered sexually transmissible, particularly among key populations.

However, understanding of the effect of vaccination on mpox clinical presentation remains limited. Methods: We interviewed cisgender males with confirmed mpox (cases) reported to the California Department of Public Health from May 2022 through December 2023. We ascertained cases' vaccination statuses via the California Immunization Registry. We estimated JYNNEOS vaccine effectiveness against progression (VEP) to disease involving disseminated lesions via the adjusted odds ratio of vaccination, comparing cases who reported lesions disseminated across multiple anatomical regions to cases who reported lesions contained to a single anatomical region. We used the same approach to estimate VEP for prodromal symptoms. Findings: Analyses included 4,613 cases, among whom 3,045 (66.0%) reported disseminated lesions and 1,956 (42.4%) had HIV infection. Among cases who reported disseminated lesions, 114 (3.7%) received pre-exposure vaccination and 43 (1.4%) received post-exposure vaccination only. In contrast, among cases who reported lesions contained to a single anatomical region, 286 (18.2%) received pre-exposure vaccination and 146 (9.3%) received post-exposure vaccination only. For any pre-exposure vaccination, VEP was 58.9% (95% confidence interval: 50.4-65.9%), while VEP for two pre-exposure doses was 61.0% (47.3-71.1%). For post-exposure vaccination, VEP was 15.9% (3.3-26.8%). Among cases without HIV and cases with HIV, pre-exposure VEP was 66.4% (56.6-74.0%) and 45.3% (28.0-58.5%), respectively. Pre-exposure vaccination was also associated with reduced odds for illness involving fever, chills, and lymphadenopathy.

According to UNICEF, the global malaria mortality rate exceeded 600,000 annually in 2022, which includes more than 1000 children dying each day. This study aimed to investigate the comprehensive chemical profile and biological activities, particularly the antimalarial activity, of Lycium shawii (Awsaj), a shrub traditionally used in the Arabian Peninsula, Middle East, India, and Africa to treat a myriad of ailments. Methods: Crude extracts of L. shawii were prepared using water, ethanol, methanol, and acetone. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (MS) were utilized to perform untargeted metabolomics to maximize metabolite detection and tentatively identify bioactive phytochemicals. The total phenolic content (TPC) was measured for each extract, and bioassays were conducted to evaluate their antimalarial, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory activities, particularly those of the water extract, which is the traditional method of consumption in Arabian folk medicine. Results: A total of 148 metabolites were detected, 45 of which were classified as phytochemicals. The bioassays revealed that the water extract that is traditionally used showed promising antimalarial potential by significantly inhibiting \u03b2-hematin formation in vitro at 1 mg/mL (with an absorbance of 0.140 \u00b1 0.027). This is likely due to the rich presence of quinoline in the aqueous extract among several other bioactive phytochemicals, such as phenylpropanoids, alkaloids, flavonoids, and benzenoids. However, their anti-inflammatory and antibacterial activities were found to be weak, with only a minor inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) production in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells at a concentration of 500 \u00b5g/mL and weak antibacterial effects against pathogens like P. aeruginosa, MRSA, A. baumannii, and K. pneumoniae with an MIC of 500 \u03bcg/mL. The results also revealed that the methanolic extract had the highest TPC at 26.265 \u00b1 0.005 mg GAE/g.

By contrast, CGRP targeting therapies for migraine prevention are effective in both men and women with frequent EM or chronic migraine (CM). Preclinical studies have shown that supradural application of CGRP preferentially produces migraine-like pain behaviors in female rodents. We hypothesized that, in male mice, increased frequency of migraine-like pain may sensitize to nociceptive effects of CGRP and this might be associated with altered expression of CGRP in trigeminal ganglion (TG) neurons and/or in their dural projections.\n\n\nMETHODS\nCM was modeled in male and female mice by repeated administration of nitroglycerin (NTG). Medication overuse headache (MOH), a form of CM, was modeled by repeated daily administration of sumatriptan. Following resolution of transient cutaneous allodynia (CA) elicited by NTG or sumatriptan, mice received a sex specific subthreshold dose of supradural CGRP that does not elicit CA in na\u00efve male or female mice, and CA was evaluated. CGRP-positive cell bodies in the ophthalmic V1 region of the trigeminal ganglion (TGV1) and CGRP-positive nerve fibers innervating the dura mater were assessed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSupradural administration of 1 pg of CGRP produced migraine-like pain behaviors in female, but not male, mice; a ten-fold lower dose was established as subthreshold in na\u00efve female mice. Repeated NTG or sumatriptan produced transient CA in both female and male mice that resolved within 8-11 days after treatment cessation. Following resolution of CA, previously subthreshold doses of CGRP elicited CA in CM and MOH models in mice of both sexes, with no effects observed in vehicle treated controls. A higher number of CGRP-positive neurons in the TGV1 was found in na\u00efve female compared to male mice. The number of CGRP-positive TGV1 neurons was increased in both sexes following repeated NTG. Similar nerve fiber density was observed in the dura mater of male and female mice and no differences were detected following repeated NTG.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAs previously reported, CGRP produced female-selective migraine-like pain behaviors in na\u00efve mice. Consistent with behavioral effects, female mice demonstrated a higher number of CGRP-positive cells in the TGV1. These findings appear relevant to clinical observations of female efficacy of CGRP-receptor antagonists for acute treatment in EM patients. In models of CM or MOH that are characterized by increased frequency of migraine-like pain, previously subthreshold doses of supradural CGRP now elicited migraine-like nociceptive behaviors in mice of both sexes. The increased pain responses were accompanied by increased number CGRP positive TGV1 cells in the NTG model in both female and male mice. These data suggest that increased frequency of migraine promotes physiological changes including increased expression of TGV1 CGRP along with sensitization to CGRP-induced nociception in both males and females. Thus, as EM transforms to CM, CGRP-dependent mechanisms may become increasingly important, consistent with observations of efficacy of CGRP targeting therapies for migraine prevention in both men and women. Our results also suggest the possibility of enhanced efficacy of CGRP-receptor antagonists for the acute treatment of migraine in men as migraine frequency increases.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-01", "synthetic_support_claim": "As EM transforms to CM, CGRP-dependent mechanisms may become increasingly important for both sexes.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "CGRP-receptor antagonists are effective for acute treatment of episodic migraine in men."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "6f40319ca2025bb72b5fb92ffe89ca48939d9259", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6f40319ca2025bb72b5fb92ffe89ca48939d9259", "title": "Mpox (monkeypox)", "abstract": "Abstract: Mpox (formerly \u201cmonkeypox\u201d) is a viral zoonosis that presents similarly to smallpox but is less contagious and causes less severe disease.

It is now considered a public health priority because of its rising incidence and transmission from person to person. Monkeypox virus (MPXV) VP39 protein is identified as an essential protein for replication of the virus, and therefore, it is a potential target for antiviral drugs. Methods: This work analyzes the binding affinities and the differential conformational stability of three target compounds and one control compound with the VP39 protein through multiple computational methods. Results: The re-docking analysis revealed that the compounds had high binding affinities towards the target protein; among these compounds, compounds 1 and 2 showed the highest binding energies in the virtual screening, and thus, these were considered as the most active inhibitor candidates. Intermolecular interaction analysis revealed distinct binding mechanisms. While compound 1 had very strong hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, compound 2 had numerous water-mediated interactions, and compound 3 had only ionic and hydrophobic contacts. In molecular dynamic simulations, compounds 1 and 2 showed that the protein\u2013ligand complexes had a stable conformation, with protein RMSD values around 2 \u00c5 for both compounds. In contrast, compound 3 was slightly flexible, and the control compound was more flexible. MM/GBSA analysis again supported these results, which gave the binding free energies that were also supportive for these compounds.

HPV vaccination at ages 9 through 12 years will likely prevent more than 90% of cervical precancers and cancers. In people with a cervix aged 21 through 65 years, cervical cancer is prevented by screening for and treating cervical precancer, defined as high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions of the cervix. High-grade lesions can progress to cervical cancer if not treated. Cervicovaginal HPV testing is 90% sensitive for detecting precancer. In the general population, the risk of precancer is less than 0.15% over 5 years following a negative HPV test result. Among people with a positive HPV test result, a combination of HPV genotyping and cervical cytology (Papanicolaou testing) can identify the risk of precancer. For people with current precancer risks of less than 4%, repeat HPV testing is recommended in 1, 3, or 5 years depending on 5-year precancer risk. For people with current precancer risks of 4% through 24%, such as those with low-grade cytology test results (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance [ASC-US] or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion [LSIL]) and a positive HPV test of unknown duration, colposcopy is recommended. For patients with precancer risks of less than 25% (eg, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1 [CIN1] or histologic LSIL), treatment-related adverse effects, including possible association with preterm labor, can be reduced by repeating colposcopy to monitor for precancer and avoiding excisional treatment. For patients with current precancer risks of 25% through 59% (eg, high-grade cytology results of ASC cannot exclude high-grade lesion [ASC-H] or high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion [HSIL] with positive HPV test results), management consists of colposcopy with biopsy or excisional treatment. For those with current precancer risks of 60% or more, such as patients with HPV-16-positive HSIL, proceeding directly to excisional treatment is preferred, but performing a colposcopy first to confirm the need for excisional treatment is acceptable. Clinical decision support tools can facilitate correct management.\n\n\nConclusions and Relevance\nApproximately 100\u202f000 people are treated for cervical precancer each year in the US to prevent cervical cancer. People with a cervix should be screened with HPV testing, and if HPV-positive, genotyping and cytology testing should be performed to assess the risk of cervical precancer and determine the need for colposcopy or treatment.

Current treatments are ineffective in removing excess cholesterol from the diseased arteries. Accordingly, increasing expression of cholesterol export proteins such as ATP-binding cassette subfamily A, member 1 (ABCA1), may enhance cholesterol efflux and impede atherosclerosis development. We previously showed that endothelial cells (ECs) transduced with a viral vector can release small delivery vehicles (exosomes) loaded with a therapeutic molecule (antagomir) targeting miR-33a-5p, which inhibits ABCA1. The addition of a short \u2018X-motif\u2019 sequence enhanced antagomir packaging into exosomes and delivery into artery wall cell types in vitro. In the present study, we explored whether this EC-based exosome-mediated strategy can deliver the anti-miR-33a-5p into the medial cells of the rabbit artery in vivo. The X-motif antagomir was found in the medial cells of the transduced arteries; however, this strategy still requires further refinement to enhance antagomir expression and delivery within the artery wall.

Methods Enrolled participants had mCRPC that progressed on one prior androgen receptor pathway inhibitor (ARPI), were prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET\u2013positive as determined by a central reader, were chemotherapy-na\u00efve for mCRPC, and had adequate bone marrow and end-organ reserve. Participants received up to 4 cycles of [177Lu]Lu-PNT2002 at 6.8 GBq (\u00b1 10%) intravenously per cycle every 8 weeks. Dosimetry (planar + SPECT/CT [n=7]; planar only [n=20]), safety, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, objective response rate (ORR), and radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) per blinded independent central review were assessed. Results Of 34 individuals screened, 32 underwent PSMA-PET/CT; 27 met all eligibility criteria. Median (range) age was 72 (57-86) years; all participants were enrolled in North America; 40.7% initiated prior ARPI treatment without distant metastases (M0) and 25.9% while hormone sensitive. Nineteen of 27 (70.4%) participants completed all 4 planned cycles. Organs receiving the largest mean (median, range) specific absorbed doses were lacrimal glands at 1.2 (0.9, 0.4-6.7) Gy/GBq (planar only [n=27]), followed by kidneys at 0.73 (0.63, 0.22-1.8) Gy/GBq (planar + SPECT/CT [n=7]; planar only [n=20]).

However, the blood-based neurodegeneration marker neurofilament light is not specific to Alzheimer\u2019s disease while total-tau shows lack of correlation with CSF total-tau. Recent studies suggest that blood total-tau originates principally from peripheral, non-brain sources. We sought to address this challenge by generating an anti-tau antibody that selectively binds brain-derived tau and avoids the peripherally expressed \u2018big tau\u2019 isoform. We applied this antibody to develop an ultrasensitive blood-based assay for brain-derived tau, and validated it in five independent cohorts (n = 609) including a blood-to-autopsy cohort, CSF biomarker-classified cohorts and memory clinic cohorts. In paired samples, serum and CSF brain-derived tau were significantly correlated (rho = 0.85, P < 0.0001), while serum and CSF total-tau were not (rho = 0.23, P = 0.3364). Blood-based brain-derived tau showed equivalent diagnostic performance as CSF total-tau and CSF brain-derived tau to separate biomarker-positive Alzheimer\u2019s disease participants from biomarker-negative controls. Furthermore, plasma brain-derived tau accurately distinguished autopsy-confirmed Alzheimer\u2019s disease from other neurodegenerative diseases (area under the curve = 86.4%) while neurofilament light did not (area under the curve = 54.3%). These performances were independent of the presence of concomitant pathologies. Plasma brain-derived tau (rho = 0.52\u20130.67, P = 0.003), but not neurofilament light (rho = \u22120.14\u20130.17, P = 0.501), was associated with global and regional amyloid plaque and neurofibrillary tangle counts. These results were further verified in two memory clinic cohorts where serum brain-derived tau differentiated Alzheimer\u2019s disease from a range of other neurodegenerative disorders, including frontotemporal lobar degeneration and atypical parkinsonian disorders (area under the curve up to 99.6%). Notably, plasma/serum brain-derived tau correlated with neurofilament light only in Alzheimer\u2019s disease but not in the other neurodegenerative diseases. Across cohorts, plasma/serum brain-derived tau was associated with CSF and plasma AT(N) biomarkers and cognitive function. Brain-derived tau is a new blood-based biomarker that outperforms plasma total-tau and, unlike neurofilament light, shows specificity to Alzheimer\u2019s disease-type neurodegeneration.

The FTLD Survival Score (FTLD\u2010SS) was calculated by the \u03b2 coefficients of the variables independently associated with survival rate. RESULTS Increased plasma NfL levels (p < 0.001), older age at evaluation (p = 0.002), positive family history (p = 0.04), and motor phenotypes (p < 0.001) were associated with reduced survival. The predictive validity of FTLD\u2010SS was 0.75 (95% confidence interval, 0.59\u20130.91) at 1 year.

Recent work suggests that the gut microbiome of symptomatic patients with AD has an altered taxonomic composition compared with that of healthy, cognitively normal control individuals. However, knowledge about changes in the gut microbiome before the onset of symptomatic AD is limited. In this cross-sectional study that accounted for clinical covariates and dietary intake, we compared the taxonomic composition and gut microbial function in a cohort of 164 cognitively normal individuals, 49 of whom showed biomarker evidence of early preclinical AD. Gut microbial taxonomic profiles of individuals with preclinical AD were distinct from those of individuals without evidence of preclinical AD. The change in gut microbiome composition correlated with \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) and tau pathological biomarkers but not with biomarkers of neurodegeneration, suggesting that the gut microbiome may change early in the disease process. We identified specific gut bacterial taxa associated with preclinical AD. Inclusion of these microbiome features improved the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of machine learning classifiers for predicting preclinical AD status when tested on a subset of the cohort (65 of the 164 participants).

Thus, largescale longitudinal clinical investigations that assess causation and underlying mechanisms via in depth analysis methods are needed. In neurodegeneration research, strong causal evidence now links the gut microbiome to Alzheimer's (AD), and Parkinson's Disease (PD), as supported by human-to-animal transplantation studies. Longitudinal interventions are being conducted in AD, PD, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease, and multiple sclerosis. Neurodevelopmental research has also seen a boon in microbiome-related clinical research including in autism, Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and schizophrenia, which is confirming prior animal model work regarding the key time-windows in the gut microbiome important for infant cognition.

Efficacy will be assessed using specific outcomes, such as 30-day mortality and the requirement for mechanical ventilation. Safety evaluations will include adverse events like gastrointestinal bleeding and healthcare-associated infections. The study seeks to address the gaps identified in the latest guidelines regarding the optimal use of different corticosteroid types and to provide recommendations for clinical practice. Data Sources This study conducted a comprehensive search of Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, covering the period from inception until 22 June 2023. Randomized clinical trials for corticosteroid use among adults with SCAP were collected. Study Selection Two researchers independently assessed study eligibility based on titles and abstracts, with any disagreements resolved through discussion or consultation with a third researcher. Data Extraction Two researchers independently collected and clarified study details, with a third researcher adjudicating in case of disputes. Data Synthesis The data from 13 randomized clinical trials involving 2,495 patients, were analyzed using a random-effects model. Eleven trials were assessed as low risk, while two were assessed as high risk. Trials were rated as having low bias risk. Results, presented as risk ratios (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI), indicated that hydrocortisone outperformed prednisolone (RR 0.35; 95% CI 0.10\u20130.94), methylprednisolone (RR 0.41; 95% CI 0.15\u20130.89), and placebo (RR 0.35; 95% CI 0.16\u20130.59) in reducing 30-day mortality.

Existing studies on the association between temperatures and cardiovascular deaths have been limited in geographic zones and have generally considered associations with total cardiovascular deaths rather than cause-specific cardiovascular deaths. Methods: We used unified data collection protocols within the Multi-Country Multi-City Collaborative Network to assemble a database of daily counts of specific cardiovascular causes of death from 567 cities in 27 countries across 5 continents in overlapping periods ranging from 1979 to 2019. City-specific daily ambient temperatures were obtained from weather stations and climate reanalysis models. To investigate cardiovascular mortality associations with extreme hot and cold temperatures, we fit case-crossover models in each city and then used a mixed-effects meta-analytic framework to pool individual city estimates. Extreme temperature percentiles were compared with the minimum mortality temperature in each location. Excess deaths were calculated for a range of extreme temperature days. Results: The analyses included deaths from any cardiovascular cause (32\u2009154 \u2009935), ischemic heart disease (11\u2009745\u2009880), stroke (9\u2009351\u2009312), heart failure (3\u2009673\u2009723), and arrhythmia (670\u2009859). At extreme temperature percentiles, heat (99th percentile) and cold (1st percentile) were associated with higher risk of dying from any cardiovascular cause, ischemic heart disease, stroke, and heart failure as compared to the minimum mortality temperature, which is the temperature associated with least mortality. Across a range of extreme temperatures, hot days (above 97.5th percentile) and cold days (below 2.5th percentile) accounted for 2.2 (95% empirical CI [eCI], 2.1\u20132.3) and 9.1 (95% eCI, 8.9\u20139.2) excess deaths for every 1000 cardiovascular deaths, respectively.

However, its prognostic effect on patients with carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) infection is little known. The objective of this study was to investigate the risk factors for mortality associated with CRKP infection and the clinical value of NLR in predicting prognosis in these patients. Methods A total of 190 inpatients with CRKP infection from 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023 were enrolled in this study, namely, 73 fatal cases and 117 survival cases in hospital. The medical data and examination results of these patients were collected. A logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the association between the NLR on the day of CRKP infection onset and all-cause mortality in hospital. Results The overall mortality rate of patients with CRKP infection was 38.42% (73/190). Of the 190 patients, 91 were co-infected with carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii/carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CRAB/CRPA). Multifactor regression analysis confirmed that carbapenem exposure in the past 14 days, central line insertion, and chronic Foley catheter requirement were independent risk factors for carbapenem-resistant bacteria co-infection. The multivariate analysis shows that admission to an ICU, co-infection with CRAB/CRPA, and higher NLR were independent risk factors for the mortality in hospital, while appropriate treatment within 3 days was an independent protective factor. The area under the curve (AUC) of the NLR was 0.696, and the cutoff value of the NLR was 10.73.

In this study, we report an outbreak of CRKP in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) within a 200-bed tertiary hospital. The main goal of this study was to characterize the phenotypic and genomic profiles of the CRKP isolates involved in the outbreak and to gain insights into their resistance mechanisms and transmission dynamics within the NICU. Methods The study was conducted between November and December 2023 in a 5-bed NICU. Monthly surveillance cultures were performed to monitor colonization and infection with multidrug-resistant organisms. CRKP isolates were obtained from blood and nasal swabs of affected neonates. Identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing were initially conducted using the Vitek\u00ae2 system with an N-395 card and further confirmed by 16S rRNA sequencing. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiling were performed to identify resistance genes and virulence factors. For genetic analysis, both Illumina short-read and Nanopore long-read sequencing were used, followed by hybrid assembly for enhanced genome resolution. Plasmid and resistance gene profiles were determined using AMRFinder and PlasmidFinder databases. Results A total of three CRKP isolates (designated Kp1, Kp2, and Kp3) were identified. Kp1 and Kp2 belonged to sequence type (ST) ST23 and were genetically near-identical, differing by a single allele, while Kp3 was of a distinct sequence type, ST2096, with 245 allelic differences from Kp1 and Kp2. All isolates were resistant to colistin and carried resistance genes, including mcr-1 and bla NDM-1, bla KPC2 confirming carbapenem resistance. Efflux pump genes and aminoglycoside resistance genes were also detected, providing a multifaceted defence against antibiotics. Plasmid analysis identified several incompatibility groups (IncFI, IncHI, IncFIB, IncX), indicating the potential for horizontal gene transfer of resistance determinants. Conclusion This study highlights the complexity of CRKP outbreaks in neonatal care, with isolates exhibiting resistance mechanisms that complicate treatment.

The results of the phytochemical analysis showed that the formulation is rich in benzoic acids, namely gentisic acid (155.31 \u00b5g/mL) and phenylethanoid compounds, namely hydroxytyrosol (39.79 \u00b5g/mL) that support the antioxidant effects measured via DPPH (IC50: 1.48 mg/mL), ABTS (IC50: 0.42 mg/mL), and horseradish peroxidase (IC50: 2.02 mg/mL) assays. The ecotoxicological models indicated the formulation as non-toxic, permitting the identification of a biocompatible concentration (1000 \u00b5g/mL) to be used in isolated mouse cortex exposed to K+ 60 mM Krebs\u2013Ringer buffer. In this model, the gene expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), estrogen receptor-1 (ESR1), prolactin receptor (PRLR), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and serotonin transporter (SERT) was determined by real-time PCR. In the isolated mouse cortex, the formula reduced COX-2, IL-6, SERT, ESR1, and PRLR gene expression and increased BDNF and IL-10 gene expression.

However, it is largely unknown how such metabolic phenotypes influence the radiation response in aggressive cancers. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the impact of hyper-energy metabolism (increased glycolysis and OxPhos) on the radiation response of a human glioma cell line.MethodsModulation of the mitochondrial electron transport chain was carried out using a 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP). Metabolic characterization was carried out by assessing glucose uptake, lactate production, mitochondrial mass, membrane potential, and ATP production. The radiation response was examined by cell growth, clonogenic survival, and cell death assays. Macromolecular oxidation was assessed by DNA damage, lipid peroxidation, and protein carbonylation assay.ResultsHypermetabolic OPM-BMG cells exhibited a significant increase in glycolysis and OxPhos following irradiation as compared to the parental BMG-1 cells. Enhanced radioresistance of OPM-BMG cells was evidenced by the increase in \u03b1/\u03b2 ratio (9.58) and D1 dose (4.18\u2009Gy) as compared to 4.36 and 2.19\u2009Gy in BMG-1 cells respectively. Moreover, OPM-BMG cells were found to exhibit increased resistance against radiation-induced cell death, and macromolecular oxidation as compared to BMG-1 cells. Inhibition of glycolysis and mitochondrial complex-II significantly enhanced the radiosensitivity of OPM-BMG cells compared to BMG-1 cells.ConclusionOur results demonstrate that the hyper-energy metabolism of increased glycolysis and OxPhos confer radioresistance.

Mucosal immunity within the respiratory tract includes tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells and tissue-resident memory B (BRM) cells, which provides rapid and efficient protection against RSV re-infection. Therefore, vaccine strategies should aim to generate mucosal immune responses. However, the interactions between RSV vaccines and mucosal immune responses within the respiratory tract are poorly understood. We evaluated a mucosal immune system following immunization by RSV vaccine with poly-sorbitol transporter (RSV-PST), a nanoparticle adjuvant. Methods: We intranasally immunized the RSV-PST and identified the systemic and mucosal immune responses. Furthermore, we challenged with RSV A2 strain after immunization and investigated the protective effects. Results: Consequently, antigen-specific CD8+ TRM cells were markedly elevated in the lung parenchyma, yet exhibited impaired cytokine expression. In contrast, humoral immunity, with systemic antibody production from serum, but not in the respiratory tract, was significantly increased by RSV-PST immunization. Interestingly, the production of respiratory mucosal antigen-specific IgG after RSV A2 challenge dramatically increased in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of the RSV-PST immunized group in the presence of FTY720, and the lung-infected RSV titer was significantly lower in this group. Furthermore, after RSV A2 challenge, CD69+ IgG+ BRM cells were significantly increased in lung tissues in the RSV-PST group.

The primary end point was the annualized rate of moderate or severe exacerbations of COPD. Key secondary and other end points that were corrected for multiplicity were the change in the prebronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and in the scores on the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ; range, 0 to 100, with lower scores indicating a better quality of life) and the Evaluating Respiratory Symptoms in COPD (E-RS-COPD; range, 0 to 40, with lower scores indicating less severe symptoms).\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 939 patients underwent randomization: 468 to the dupilumab group and 471 to the placebo group.

Results The analysis identified 816 trials with 471 038 patients, together evaluating 13 different drug classes; all subsequent estimates refer to the comparison with standard treatments. Sodium glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors (odds ratio 0.88, 95% confidence interval 0.83 to 0.94; high certainty) and GLP-1 receptor agonists (0.88, 0.82 to 0.93; high certainty) reduce all cause death; non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, so far tested only with finerenone in patients with chronic kidney disease, probably reduce mortality (0.89, 0.79 to 1.00; moderate certainty); other drugs may not. The study confirmed the benefits of SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists in reducing cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, admission to hospital for heart failure, and end stage kidney disease. Finerenone probably reduces admissions to hospital for heart failure and end stage kidney disease, and possibly cardiovascular death. Only GLP-1 receptor agonists reduce non-fatal stroke; SGLT-2 inhibitors are superior to other drugs in reducing end stage kidney disease. GLP-1 receptor agonists and probably SGLT-2 inhibitors and tirzepatide improve quality of life. Reported harms were largely specific to drug class (eg, genital infections with SGLT-2 inhibitors, severe gastrointestinal adverse events with tirzepatide and GLP-1 receptor agonists, hyperkalaemia leading to admission to hospital with finerenone). Tirzepatide probably results in the largest reduction in body weight (mean difference \u22128.57 kg; moderate certainty). Basal insulin (mean difference 2.15 kg; moderate certainty) and thiazolidinediones (mean difference 2.81 kg; moderate certainty) probably result in the largest increases in body weight. Absolute benefits of SGLT-2 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists, and finerenone vary in people with type 2 diabetes, depending on baseline risks for cardiovascular and kidney outcomes (https://matchit.magicevidence.org/230125dist-diabetes). Conclusions This network meta-analysis extends knowledge beyond confirming the substantial benefits with the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists in reducing adverse cardiovascular and kidney outcomes and death by adding information on finerenone and tirzepatide. These findings highlight the need for continuous assessment of scientific progress to introduce cutting edge updates in clinical practice guidelines for people with type 2 diabetes.

We explored whether mitochondria influence the species-specific timing of cortical neuron maturation. By comparing human and mouse cortical neuronal maturation at high temporal and cell resolution, we found a slower mitochondria development in human cortical neurons compared with that in the mouse, together with lower mitochondria metabolic activity, particularly that of oxidative phosphorylation. Stimulation of mitochondria metabolism in human neurons resulted in accelerated development in vitro and in vivo, leading to maturation of cells weeks ahead of time, whereas its inhibition in mouse neurons led to decreased rates of maturation. Mitochondria are thus important regulators of the pace of neuronal development underlying human-specific brain neoteny. Description Metabolism sets neuronal development pace The pace of neuronal development varies between species, and the relatively slow development of the human brain may help allow its exceptional complexity. Iwata et al. propose that the pace of neuronal development depends on the rate of metabolic activity in mitochondria. Human and mouse neurons exhibited distinct paces of development in culture correlated with the tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative activity in mitochondria. Manipulations to increase oxygen consumption rates and tricarboxylic acid cycle activity in human cells increased the rate of neuronal development. Slowing metabolic rates in mouse neurons slowed neuronal maturation. Thus, metabolic rates in mitochondria appear to somehow help set the speed of neuronal development. \u2014LBR Mitochondria are important regulators of the pace of neuronal development underlying human-specific brain maturation. INTRODUCTION During embryonic development, the temporal sequence of events is usually conserved throughout evolution, but it can occur at very different time scales depending on the species or cell type considered. The human cerebral cortex is characterized by a considerably prolonged timing of neuronal development compared with other species, taking months to years to reach maturity compared with only a few weeks in the mouse. The resulting neoteny is thought to be a key mechanism enabling enhanced function and plasticity of the human brain. Human and nonhuman cortical neurons cultured in vitro or xenotransplanted into the mouse brain develop along their species-specific timeline. This suggests that species-specific developmental timing is controlled by cell-intrinsic mechanisms, but these remain essentially unknown. RATIONALE Metabolism and mitochondria are key drivers of cell fate transitions in many systems, including the developing brain. Here, we tested whether they could be involved in the species-specific tempo of cortical neuron development and human brain neoteny. We developed a system of genetic birth-dating to label newly born neurons with high temporal and cellular resolution, and directly compared the development of human and mouse cortical neurons over time. We thus profiled, across time and species, mitochondria morphology, gene expression, oxygen consumption, and glucose metabolism. Next, we used pharmacological or genetic manipulation of human or mouse neurons to enhance or decrease their mitochondria function, and determined the consequences on the speed of neuronal development. RESULTS We found that mitochondria are initally low in size and quantity in newborn neurons, and then grow gradually as neurons undergo maturation following a species-specific timeline. Whereas in mouse neurons, mitochondria reach mature patterns in 3 to 4 weeks, they only do so after several months in human neurons. We next measured mitochondria oxidative activity and glucose metabolism in human and mouse developing cortical neurons. This revealed a species-specific timeline of functional maturation of mitochondria, with mouse neurons displaying a much faster increase in mitochondria-dependent oxidative activity than human neurons. We also found that human cortical neurons displayed lower levels of mitochondria-driven glucose metabolism than did mouse neurons at the same age. Finally, we tested whether mitochondria function affects neuronal developmental timing. We performed pharmacological or genetic manipulation of human developing cortical neurons to enhance mitochondria oxidative metabolism. This led to accelerated neuronal maturation, with neurons exhibiting more mature features weeks ahead of time, including complex morphology, increased electrical excitability, and functional synapse formation. Similar treatments on mouse neurons also led to faster maturation, whereas inhibition of mitochondria metabolism in mouse neurons led to a decrease in developmental rates. CONCLUSION Our work identifies a species-specific temporal pattern of mitochondria and metabolic development that sets the tempo of neuronal maturation. Accelerated human neuronal maturation using metabolic manipulation might benefit pluripotent stem cell\u2013based modeling of neural diseases, which remains greatly hindered by protracted neuron development. Tools to accelerate or decelerate neuronal development could allow testing of the impact of neuronal neoteny on brain function, plasticity, and disease. Mitochondria metabolism sets the tempo of neuronal development. Mitochondria dynamics and metabolism display species-specific timelines during cortical neuron development. In newborn neurons, mitochondria are small in number and metabolic activity, and then increase gradually during neuronal maturation. Enhanced mitochondria metabolism in human neurons leads to accelerated maturation, including increased neurite complexity, excitability, and synaptic function. Decreased mitochondria metabolism in mouse neurons leads to decelerated neuronal maturation.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-01-26", "synthetic_support_claim": "Mitochondria metabolism sets the tempo of neuronal development in a species-specific manner.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Human synaptic formation is more dependent on mitochondrial activity than mouse synaptic formation."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "b2f733df9c2a7b5f693bfa4e864e2837c1c87392", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b2f733df9c2a7b5f693bfa4e864e2837c1c87392", "title": "Stimulated Emission Depletion Imaging Reveals Mitochondrial Phenotypic Heterogeneity under Apoptosis Stimuli across Living Glioma Models.", "abstract": "The mitochondrial phenotypes contribute to the understanding of disease mechanisms and treatments, which are typically characterized through the omics methods.

Maternal disorders during pregnancy were found to have an impact on the activity of the reproductive axis in the first year of life. This prospective, matched, cohort study was aimed at investigating whether the course of minipuberty in boys is affected by maternal gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Methods: The study population consisted of three matched groups of boys: infants born to women with poorly controlled GDM, sons of women with adequately controlled GDM, and infants of healthy women with normal carbohydrate tolerance during pregnancy (control group). Salivary levels of testosterone, androstenedione, DHEA-S and estradiol, and urinary concentrations of FSH and LH were repeatedly measured over the first 12 months of life. Hormone levels were correlated with the size of genital organs (testicular volume and penile length), which were measured at each visit. Results: Compared with the remaining groups, the male offspring of women with poorly controlled GDM were characterized by higher concentrations of both gonadotropins, higher salivary testosterone levels, lower salivary DHEA-S concentrations, and longer periods of detection for LH and testosterone. Levels of gonadotropin, testosterone and DHEA-S in sons of mothers with poorly controlled GDM correlated with mean levels of glycated hemoglobin during pregnancy. Moreover, the infant boys assigned to this group were characterized by larger sizes of the testes and penis. Over the entire study period, there were no differences in hormone levels, testicular volume and penile length between sons of adequately treated women with GDM and sons of healthy women.

From 2010 to 2021, the annual age-adjusted mortality of cirrhosis increased from 14.9 per 100\u202f000 to 21.9 per 100\u202f000 people.\n\n\nObservations\nThe most common causes of cirrhosis in the US, which can overlap, include alcohol use disorder (approximately 45% of all cases of cirrhosis), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (26%), and hepatitis C (41%). Patients with cirrhosis experience symptoms including muscle cramps (approximately 64% prevalence), pruritus (39%), poor-quality sleep (63%), and sexual dysfunction (53%). Cirrhosis can be diagnosed by liver biopsy but may also be diagnosed noninvasively. Elastography, a noninvasive assessment of liver stiffness measured in kilopascals, can typically confirm cirrhosis at levels of 15 kPa or greater. Approximately 40% of people with cirrhosis are diagnosed when they present with complications such as hepatic encephalopathy or ascites. The median survival time following onset of hepatic encephalopathy and ascites is 0.92 and 1.1 years, respectively. Among people with ascites, the annual incidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is 11% and of hepatorenal syndrome is 8%; the latter is associated with a median survival of less than 2 weeks. Approximately 1% to 4% of patients with cirrhosis develop hepatocellular carcinoma each year, which is associated with a 5-year survival of approximately 20%. In a 3-year randomized clinical trial of 201 patients with portal hypertension, nonselective \u03b2-blockers (carvedilol or propranolol) reduced the risk of decompensation or death compared with placebo (16% vs 27%). Compared with sequential initiation, combination aldosterone antagonist and loop diuretics were more likely to resolve ascites (76% vs 56%) with lower rates of hyperkalemia (4% vs 18%). In meta-analyses of randomized trials, lactulose was associated with reduced mortality relative to placebo (8.5% vs 14%) in randomized trials involving 705 patients and reduced risk of recurrent overt hepatic encephalopathy (25.5% vs 46.8%) in randomized trials involving 1415 patients. In a randomized clinical trial of 300 patients, terlipressin improved the rate of reversal of hepatorenal syndrome from 39% to 18%. Trials addressing symptoms of cirrhosis have demonstrated efficacy for hydroxyzine in improving sleep dysfunction, pickle brine and taurine for reducing muscle cramps, and tadalafil for improving sexual dysfunction in men.\n\n\nConclusions and Relevance\nApproximately 2.2 million US adults have cirrhosis.

However, uncertainty persists regarding the contribution of liver fibrosis to major stroke types including ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage at the population level.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn this large prospective cohort study, participants without previous stroke or coronary heart disease at baseline from the UK Biobank were included. We identified participants at high probability of advanced liver fibrosis using the Fibrosis-4 index >2.67 or aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index \u22651.0. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression analyses were conducted to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for liver fibrosis with the incidence of major stroke types, stroke-related death, and all-cause death.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAmong 379\u2009953 participants (mean age, 56.2 [SD, 8.1] years; 44.6% men), 7396 (1.9%) had a Fibrosis-4 index >2.67 at baseline. During a median follow-up of 12.75 (interquartile range, 12.03-13.48) years, 7143 (1.9%) incident stroke cases were documented. Advanced liver fibrosis assessed by the Fibrosis-4 index was associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke (HR, 1.94 [95% CI, 1.70-2.22]), intracerebral hemorrhage (HR, 2.14 [95% CI, 1.63-2.81]), subarachnoid hemorrhage (HR, 1.90 [95% CI, 1.27-2.84), stroke-related death (HR, 2.20 [95% CI, 1.73-2.80]), and all-cause death (HR, 2.59 [95% CI, 2.46-2.73]). Using the aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index as an alternative score, liver fibrosis was correlated with magnified risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (HR, 3.76 [95% CI, 2.38-5.93]) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (HR, 3.05 [95% CI, 1.51-6.13]) compared with ischemic stroke (HR, 1.58 [95% CI, 1.17-2.14]). Restricted cubic spline analysis showed nonlinear associations of the Fibrosis-4 index and aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index with stroke incidence and all-cause death.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nLiver fibrosis is associated with increased risk of incident stroke and death among people without previous stroke or cardiovascular events, with particularly greater risk of intracerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage.

Tumor cells produce and release large amounts of lactic acid into the tumor microenvironment through aberrant glycolysis via the Warburg effect, leading to a drop in pH. Elevated lactic acid levels profoundly suppress proliferation capacity, cytotoxic functions, and migratory abilities of immune effector cells such as macrophages and natural killer cells at the tumor site. Moreover, lactic acid can modulate the expression of surface molecules on immune cells, interfering with their recognition and attack of tumor cells, and it regulates signaling pathways that promote the expansion and enhanced function of immunosuppressive cells like regulatory T cells, thereby fostering immune tolerance within the tumor microenvironment. Current research is actively exploring strategies targeting lactic acid metabolism to ameliorate tumor immune evasion. Key approaches under investigation include inhibiting the activity of critical enzymes in lactic acid production to reduce its synthesis or blocking lactate transporters to alter intracellular and extracellular lactate distribution. These methods hold promise when combined with existing immunotherapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies to enhance the immune system\u2019s ability to eliminate tumor cells.

Methods Healthy adult mice running for 6 weeks as an exercise model and sedentary mice as the control were used to perform transcriptomic, proteomic, lactylation-proteomic, and metabolomic analyses. Correlation analysis between transcriptome and proteome and between proteome and metabolome was also conducted. Results In this study, 159 lactylation sites of 78 proteins were identified as being differentially regulated by moderate-intensity exercise. Enrichment analysis showed that the lactylation of proteins Atp5mg, and Atp5po exhibited ATP hydrolysis activity. Mtatp8 and Atp5po were involved in biological processes such as mitochondrial transmembrane transport, and Mtatp8, Atp5mg, and Atp5po participate in oxidative phosphorylation and thermogenesis pathways. The lactylation levels of Mtatp8, Atp5mg, and Atp5po proteins in the exercise group were significantly decreased, while their protein levels were significantly increased. The combined analysis of proteomics and metabolomics showed that the oxocarboxylic acid metabolism and sphingolipid signaling pathways had significant changes under the influence of moderate-intensity exercise. Discussion Our results indicate that moderate-intensity exercise has an effect on the lactylation level of mice, possibly by reducing the lactylation levels of Mtatp8, Atp5mg, and Atp5po and increasing the expression of their protein levels, thereby regulating the oxidative phosphorylation pathway and participating in energy metabolism.

Recently, clonal hematopoiesis (CH) has been reported to be associated with cardiovascular and thromboembolic diseases. Here, we investigated the prevalence and clinical impact of CH in patients with CTEPH. Methods and Results Whole\u2010exome sequencing and deep\u2010panel sequencing were performed in 214 patients with CTEPH. Clinical data before and after treatment were compared between patients with and without CH. RNA sequencing and serum analysis were performed to explore the pathogenesis that CH contributes to CTEPH. Among the enrolled patients, 20.1%, notably 44.4% who were 80 to 89\u2009years old, had variants in CH\u2010associated genes. In regard to clinical impact, B\u2010type natriuretic peptide levels and home oxygen therapy rate were significantly higher, and 6\u2010minute walk distance was significantly shorter after treatment in patients with CH than in those without CH. Moreover, novel clot reformation in the pulmonary artery despite the use of anticoagulants and additional angioplasty events after treatment completion were more frequent in patients with CH. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that blood coagulation and neutrophil extracellular trap formation pathways were enriched in patients with CH.

Results From 1990 to 2019, significant increases in age standardised incidence rate and age standardised DALY rate were found for type 2 diabetes in adolescents and young adults globally (P<0.001). Age standardised incidence rate (per 100\u2009000 population) increased from 117.22 (95% confidence interval 117.07 to 117.36) in 1990 to 183.36 (183.21 to 183.51) in 2019, and age standardised DALY rate (per 100\u2009000 population) increased from 106.34 (106.20 to 106.48) in 1990 to 149.61 (149.47 to 149.75) in 2019.

When grouped by countries with different sociodemographic indexes, countries with a low-middle and middle sociodemographic index had the highest age standardised incidence rate and age standardised DALY rate in 2019, whereas countries with a low sociodemographic index had the lowest age standardised incidence rate but the highest age standardised mortality rate. Women generally had higher mortality and DALY rates than men at ages <30 years, but differences between the sexes were reversed in those aged >30 years except in countries with a low sociodemographic index. The main attributable risk factor for DALY for early onset type 2 diabetes was high body mass index in all regions by sociodemographic index.

Despite the growing interest in using cardiac biomarkers in pediatric patients, there is no established guideline for its routine use in clinical practices. In this study, we aimed to retrospectively evaluate the demographic characteristics, symptoms, examinations and follow-up results of patients who applied to the pediatric emergency service with various clinical complaints and requested troponin levels, and the role of serum troponin levels in diagnosis. \nMethods: We retrospectively analyzed the demographic characteristics, symptoms, examinations, examinations and follow-ups of patients aged 1 month to 18 years, who applied to our pediatric emergency department and required troponin levels over a two-year period. Results: Out of the 1890 patients included in the study, 50.9% were female, and their mean age was 12.36\u00b14.32 years. The most common reasons for requesting cardiac troponin were chest pain (59.1%), poisoning (10%), palpitations (8.3%), and syncope (7%). Only 55 (2.9%) of the cardiac troponin tests were found to be elevated based on the normal reference range.

Materials and Methods This retrospective study included patients with acute myocarditis who underwent cardiac MRI (3.0 T) between March 2016 and October 2022. Diagnosis was confirmed by diagnostic cardiac MRI criteria or endomyocardial biopsy. The primary end point was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), defined as the composite of cardiac death, heart failure hospitalization, heart transplantation, sustained ventricular arrhythmia, and recurrent myocarditis. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed to assess the association of clinical and cardiac MRI variables with the primary end point. The prognostic value of each model was assessed using the Harrell C index. Results A total of 235 patients (mean age, 32 years \u00b1 13 [SD]; 150 [63.8%] men) were included. During a mean follow-up of 1637 days (IQR: 1441-1833 days), MACEs occurred in 45 (19%) patients. Patients with MACEs had higher global native T1, ECV, and T2 values (1342 msec \u00b1 64 vs 1263 msec \u00b1 48; P < .001; 39.1% \u00b1 8.7 vs 32.7% \u00b1 5.7; P < .001; 61.1 msec \u00b1 10.0 vs 55.3 msec \u00b1 9.4; P = .03, respectively). In a series of multivariable Cox regression models, native T1 (per 10-msec increase: hazard ratio, 1.61; 95% CI: 1.31, 1.98; P < .001) and ECV (per 5% increase: hazard ratio, 1.70; 95% CI: 1.38, 2.08; P < .001) independently predicted MACE occurrence, and the addition of native T1 (Harrell C index = 0.76) or ECV (Harrell C index = 0.79) to the model including only clinical variables, left ventricular ejection fraction, and septal late gadolinium enhancement (Harrell C index = 0.72) improved discrimination for the primary end point. Conclusion Cardiac MRI-derived native T1 and ECV were independent predictors of MACEs in patients with acute myocarditis and provided incremental prognostic value when combined with conventional parameters.

A promising solution to curb online hate speech is counterspeech. Counterspeech is aimed at encouraging users to reconsider hateful posts by direct replies. However, current methods lack scalability due to the need for human intervention or fail to adapt to the specific context of the post. A potential remedy is the use of generative AI, specifically large language models (LLMs), to write tailored counterspeech messages. In this paper, we analyze whether contextualized counterspeech generated by state-of-the-art LLMs is effective in curbing online hate speech. To do so, we conducted a large-scale, pre-registered field experiment (N=2,664) on the social media platform Twitter/X. Our experiment followed a 2x2 between-subjects design and, additionally, a control condition with no counterspeech. On the one hand, users posting hateful content on Twitter/X were randomly assigned to receive either (a) contextualized counterspeech or (b) non-contextualized counterspeech. Here, the former is generated through LLMs, while the latter relies on predefined, generic messages. On the other hand, we tested two counterspeech strategies: (a) promoting empathy and (b) warning about the consequences of online misbehavior. We then measured whether users deleted their initial hateful posts and whether their behavior changed after the counterspeech intervention (e.g., whether users adopted a less toxic language). We find that non-contextualized counterspeech employing a warning-of-consequence strategy significantly reduces online hate speech.

We demonstrated that fine tuning a state-of-the-art YOLOv7 model through transfer learning significantly improved its performance in detecting gliomas, meningioma, and pituitary brain tumors. Our proposed deep learning model showed promising results, accurately identifying the presence and precise location of brain tumors in MRI images. The proposed approach achieved better accuracy compared to standard techniques, with a remarkable 99.5% accuracy in our analysis. However, we acknowledge that additional investigation and testing are essential to ensure the effectiveness of our method for detecting small tumors. The complexity of small tumor identification warrants ongoing research in brain tumor identification and continuous refinement of our detection systems. By pursuing this avenue, we aim to enhance the diagnostic capabilities for patients and medical practitioners in the challenging battle against brain cancers. Abstract The rapid development of abnormal brain cells that characterizes a brain tumor is a major health risk for adults since it can cause severe impairment of organ function and even death. These tumors come in a wide variety of sizes, textures, and locations. When trying to locate cancerous tumors, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a crucial tool. However, detecting brain tumors manually is a difficult and time-consuming activity that might lead to inaccuracies. In order to solve this, we provide a refined You Only Look Once version 7 (YOLOv7) model for the accurate detection of meningioma, glioma, and pituitary gland tumors within an improved detection of brain tumors system. The visual representation of the MRI scans is enhanced by the use of image enhancement methods that apply different filters to the original pictures. To further improve the training of our proposed model, we apply data augmentation techniques to the openly accessible brain tumor dataset. The curated data include a wide variety of cases, such as 2548 images of gliomas, 2658 images of pituitary, 2582 images of meningioma, and 2500 images of non-tumors. We included the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) attention mechanism into YOLOv7 to further enhance its feature extraction capabilities, allowing for better emphasis on salient regions linked with brain malignancies. To further improve the model\u2019s sensitivity, we have added a Spatial Pyramid Pooling Fast+ (SPPF+) layer to the network\u2019s core infrastructure. YOLOv7 now includes decoupled heads, which allow it to efficiently glean useful insights from a wide variety of data. In addition, a Bi-directional Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN) is used to speed up multi-scale feature fusion and to better collect features associated with tumors. The outcomes verify the efficiency of our suggested method, which achieves a higher overall accuracy in tumor detection than previous state-of-the-art models.

Understanding the trends and future projections of asthma incidence and mortality is crucial for healthcare planning. Methods We analyzed asthma incidence and mortality data sourced from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 study from 1990 to 2021, calculated the age-standardized incidence and mortality rates (ASIR and ASMR) and the estimated annual percentage change (EAPC), meanwhile, employed Joinpoint regression model to assess the trends. The age-period-cohort model was applied to estimate the effects of the age, period, and cohort on the incidence and mortality. Finally, future asthma trends for the next 25\u202fyears were predicted utilizing the Bayesian age-period-cohort (BAPC) model. Results Over the past three decades, the incidence rate declined in waves while the mortality declined steadily. The ASIR of asthma decreased from 524.81 to 364.17 and the ASMR declined from 5.82 to 1.47. ASIR and ASMR are consistently higher in males than females during this period. The effect attributable to age on incidence was higher for the younger age group while the mortality was higher for older. The period ratio rate of incidence and mortality declined with the calendar year, and the corrections between birth cohort and the risk of incidence and mortality were negative. Our projections indicate that the ASIR and ASMR will continue to decrease by 2046, with expected rates of 330 and 0.69, respectively. Instead, the absolute number of asthma incidence cases and deaths may increase to approximately 4.5 million and 80,000, respectively.

RESULTS A total of 26 publications met eligibility criteria and form the evidentiary basis for the update. RECOMMENDATIONS The Expert Panel reiterates its overarching recommendation from the prior guideline that geriatric assessment (GA), including all essential domains, should be used to identify vulnerabilities or impairments that are not routinely captured in oncology assessments for all patients over 65 years old with cancer. Based on recently published RCTs demonstrating significantly improved clinical outcomes, all older adults with cancer (65+ years old) receiving systemic therapy with GA-identified deficits should have GA-guided management (GAM) included in their care plan. GAM includes using GA findings to inform cancer treatment decision-making as well as to address impairments through appropriate interventions, counseling, and/or referrals. A GA should include high priority aging-related domains known to be associated with outcomes in older adults with cancer: physical and cognitive function, emotional health, comorbid conditions, polypharmacy, nutrition, and social support. Clinical adaptation of the GA based on patient population, resources, and time is appropriate.

However, effective implementation of GA remains inadequate. Using selected papers indexed in Medline from the most recent 18\u00a0months to July 2024, including two outstanding interest papers, this review aimed to describe enablers and barriers to GA implementation in oncology and contrasts implementation with and without an implementation science framework. Finally, we make recommendations on applying an implementation science framework to facilitate integrating GA in oncology.\n\n\nRECENT FINDINGS\nImplementation science frameworks have been widely employed in health services research, but their use in geriatric oncology, particularly to guide GA implementation and evaluation, is limited. Lack of time in busy practices coupled with workforce shortages adds to the challenges of GA implementation and adoption. A variety of screening and assessment tools such as the G8, electronic rapid fitness assessment, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group are often used in lieu of geriatrician review and to streamline GA. When effectively implemented in oncology, GA informs care and treatment decisions for improved outcomes.\n\n\nSUMMARY\nDespite the benefits for older adults, embedding GA into routine clinical practice is critical yet not common practice. The variety of available GA tools, logistics, and individual beliefs are some of the identified barriers to GA adoption in oncology.

Like most cancers, GBMs undergo metabolic reprogramming toward glycolysis to generate lactate. Here, we show that lactate production by patient-derived GSCs and microglia/macrophages induces tumor cell epigenetic reprogramming through histone lactylation, an activating modification that leads to immunosuppressive transcriptional programs and suppression of phagocytosis via transcriptional upregulation of CD47, a \u201cdon\u2019t eat me\u201d signal, in GBM cells. Leveraging these findings, pharmacologic targeting of lactate production augments efficacy of anti-CD47 therapy. Mechanistically, lactylated histone interacts with the heterochromatin component chromobox protein homolog 3 (CBX3). Although CBX3 does not possess direct lactyltransferase activity, CBX3 binds histone acetyltransferase (HAT) EP300 to induce increased EP300 substrate specificity toward lactyl-CoA and a transcriptional shift toward an immunosuppressive cytokine profile. Targeting CBX3 inhibits tumor growth by both tumor cell\u2013intrinsic mechanisms and increased tumor cell phagocytosis.

METHODS Patients with radiologically staged T3-4, N0-2, M0 colon cancer were randomly allocated (2:1) to 6 weeks oxaliplatin-fluoropyrimidine preoperatively plus 18 postoperatively (NAC group) or 24 weeks postoperatively (control group). Patients with RAS-wildtype tumors could also be randomly assigned 1:1 to receive panitumumab or not during NAC. The primary end point was residual disease or recurrence within 2 years. Secondary outcomes included surgical morbidity, histopathologic stage, regression grade, completeness of resection, and cause-specific mortality. Log-rank analyses were by intention-to-treat. RESULTS Of 699 patients allocated to NAC, 674 (96%) started and 606 (87%) completed NAC. In total, 686 of 699 (98.1%) NAC patients and 351 of 354 (99.2%) control patients underwent surgery. Thirty patients (4.3%) allocated to NAC developed obstructive symptoms requiring expedited surgery, but there were fewer serious postoperative complications with NAC than with control. NAC produced marked T and N downstaging and histologic tumor regression (all P < .001). Resection was more often histopathologically complete: 94% (648/686) versus 89% (311/351), P < .001. Fewer NAC than control patients had residual or recurrent disease within 2 years (16.9% [118/699] v 21.5% [76/354]; rate ratio, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.54 to 0.98]; P = .037). Tumor regression correlated strongly with freedom from recurrence. Panitumumab did not enhance the benefit from NAC. Little benefit from NAC was seen in mismatch repair\u2013deficient tumors. CONCLUSION Six weeks of preoperative oxaliplatin-fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy for operable colon cancer can be delivered safely, without increasing perioperative morbidity.

The non-specific plaque hypothesis was the first attempt to explain the role of the dental biofilm in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases.

Indeed, multispecies biofilms exhibit complex interactions between the bacteria and the host. In addition, not all resident microorganisms within the biofilm are pathogenic, since beneficial bacteria exist that serve to maintain a symbiotic relationship between the plaque microbiome and the host\u2019s immune-inflammatory response, preventing the emergence of pathogenic microorganisms and the development of dysbiosis.

Voxel-based morphometry was performed to evaluate grey matter volume, and diffusion tensor imaging was carried out to analyse white matter alterations. Correlations between cognition and brain changes were conducted and Bonferroni corrected. Post-COVID syndrome patients presented with functional connectivity changes, characterized by hypoconnectivity between left and right parahippocampal areas, and between bilateral orbitofrontal and cerebellar areas compared to controls. These alterations were accompanied by reduced grey matter volume in cortical, limbic and cerebellar areas, and alterations in white matter axial and mean diffusivity. Grey matter volume loss showed significant associations with cognitive dysfunction. These cognitive and brain alterations were more pronounced in hospitalized patients compared to non-hospitalized patients. No associations with vaccination status were found.

Yet, our understanding of these interactions relies mostly on short-read sequencing methods targeting marker genes (e.g., 16S, ITS, 18S), which often fail to identify microbes at the species level. Limitations in molecular techniques and poor microbial reference databases hinder our ability to fully characterize tree-associated microbial diversity and functions. Future research should thus prioritize advanced molecular tools such as shotgun, hybrid, or long-read sequencing.

Within several years from the onset of diabetes, people with type 1 diabetes lose their ability to mount a counterregulatory response to hypoglycemia and develop hypoglycemia unawareness, thus being at risk for deteriorating to a state of severe hypoglycemia and neuroglycopenia. Pregnant individuals with type 1 diabetes are particularly prone to experience severe hypoglycemia during the first half of pregnancy. This may be not only due to the institution of strict glycemic control and the nausea and vomiting prevalent during the early months of pregnancy, but also because the counterregulatory responses are further diminished during pregnancy. Severe hypoglycemia during early pregnancy does not appear to increase the risks of spontaneous abortion or congenital fetal malformations, but the potential long-term effects on the fetus are unknown. Recent technological advances have contributed to improved glycemic control and time in range as well as decreased risk of hypoglycemia in people with diabetes. These advances include treatment with insulin analogs, use of continuous glucose monitors, and closed-loop systems for administration of insulin. Limited studies have demonstrated that pregnant individuals with type 1 diabetes may also benefit from these modalities. While ongoing research continues to explore the adjustment of closed-loop systems for optimal use during pregnancy, more effort is needed to explore the optimal use of these modalities in pregnancy.

The findings served as foundation for the identification of additional targets for combine therapy with ferroptotic inducer in the treatment of HCC and liver metastasis. Results Surprisingly, hepatocyte-restricted GPx4 loss does not suppress hepatocellular tumourigenesis. Instead, GPx4-associated ferroptotic hepatocyte death causes a tumour suppressive immune response characterised by a CXCL10-dependent infiltration of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells that is counterbalanced by PD-L1 upregulation on tumour cells as well as by a marked HMGB1-mediated myeloid derived suppressor cell (MDSC) infiltration.

However, despite the breakthrough efficacy results, the safety of CAR-T treatment is still a concern for treating physicians and their patients. Moreover, the high rate of relapse in up to 60% of patients previously treated with CAR-T represents a major challenge. There is currently extensive research activity aimed at addressing these shortfalls; strategies include changing the administration plans of CAR-T, combining it with chemotherapy, and even developing new types of CAR-T therapies. This article will focus on new CAR-T strategies that are under investigation and the results of their studies. Abstract The year 2017 was marked by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the first two chimeric antigen receptor-T (CAR-T) therapies. The approved indications were for the treatment of relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and for the treatment of patients up to 25 years of age with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that is refractory or in a second or later relapse. Since then, extensive research activities have been ongoing globally on different hematologic and solid tumors to assess the safety and efficacy of CAR-T therapy for these diseases. Limitations to CAR-T therapy became apparent from, e.g., the relapse in up to 60% of patients and certain side effects such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS). This led to extensive clinical activities aimed at overcoming these obstacles, so that the use of CAR-T therapy can be expanded. Attempts to improve on efficacy and safety include changing the CAR-T administration schedule, combining it with chemotherapy, and the development of next-generation CAR-T therapies, e.g., through the use of CAR-natural killer (CAR-NK) and CAR macrophages (CAR-Ms). This review will focus on new CAR-T treatment strategies in hematologic malignancies, clinical trials aimed at improving efficacy and addressing side effects, the challenges that CAR-T therapy faces in solid tumors, and the ongoing research aimed at overcoming these challenges.", "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-01-21", "synthetic_support_claim": "CAR-T relapses occur in up to 60% of patients treated for advanced/resistant lymphoma and leukemia.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "CAR-T therapy has been proven to be highly effective in treating all types of solid tumors."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "5c0dc1537ed020e85146c5a6940e8c2d7702f3f3", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5c0dc1537ed020e85146c5a6940e8c2d7702f3f3", "title": "Emerging strategies to overcome ovarian cancer: advances in immunotherapy", "abstract": "Ovarian cancer is the second most common malignant neoplasm of gynecological origin and the leading cause of death from cancer in the female reproductive system worldwide.

As of 1 January, 2021, all 55 of the nation\u2019s poison centers (PCs) uploaded case data automatically to NPDS. The upload interval was 4.87 [4.38, 8.62] (median [25%, 75%]) minutes, effectuating a near real-time national exposure and information database and surveillance system. Methods We analyzed the case data tabulating specific indices from NPDS. The methodology was similar to that of previous years. Where changes were introduced, the differences are identified. Cases with medical outcomes of death were evaluated by a team of medical and clinical toxicologist reviewers using an ordinal scale of 1-6 to assess the Relative Contribution to Fatality (RCF) of the exposure. Results In 2021, 2,851,166 closed encounters were logged by NPDS: 2,080,917 human exposures, 62,189 animal exposures, 703,086 information requests, 4,920 human confirmed nonexposures, and 54 animal confirmed nonexposures. Total encounters showed a 14.0% decrease from 2020, and human exposure cases decreased by 2.22%, while health care facility (HCF) human exposure cases increased by 7.20%. All information requests decreased by 37.0%, medication identification (Drug ID) requests decreased by 20.8%, and medical information requests showed a 61.1% decrease, although these remain about 13-fold higher than before the COVID-19 pandemic. Drug Information requests showed a 146% increase, reflecting COVID-19 vaccine calls to PCs. Human exposures with less serious outcomes have decreased 1.80% per year since 2008, while those with more serious outcomes (moderate, major or death) have increased 4.56% per year since 2000. Consistent with the previous year, the top 5 substance classes most frequently involved in all human exposures were analgesics (11.2%), household cleaning substances (7.49%), cosmetics/personal care products (5.88%), antidepressants (5.61%), and sedatives/hypnotics/antipsychotics (4.73%). As a class, antidepressant exposures increased most rapidly, by 1,663 cases/year (5.30%/year) over the past 10 years for cases with more serious outcomes. The top 5 most common exposures in children age 5 years or less were cosmetics/personal care products (10.8%), household cleaning substances (10.7%), analgesics (8.16%), dietary supplements/herbals/homeopathic (7.00%), and foreign bodies/toys/miscellaneous (6.51%). Drug identification requests comprised 3.64% of all information contacts. NPDS documented 4,497 human exposures resulting in death; 3,809 (84.7%) of these were judged as related (RCF of 1-Undoubtedly responsible, 2-Probably responsible, or 3-Contributory). Conclusions These data support the continued value of PC expertise and the need for specialized medical toxicology information to manage more serious exposures. Unintentional and intentional exposures continue to be a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the US. The near real-time status of NPDS represents a national public health resource to collect and monitor US exposure cases and information contacts. The continuing mission of NPDS is to provide a nationwide infrastructure for surveillance for all types of exposures (e.g., foreign body, infectious, venomous, chemical agent, or commercial product), and the identification and tracking of significant public health events. NPDS is a model system for the near real-time surveillance of national and global public health.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2022-12-01", "synthetic_support_claim": "Human exposures with more serious outcomes have increased 4.56% per year since 2000.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "NPDS data conclusively linked COVID-19 vaccinations to an increase in severe adverse reactions in 2021."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "4f448fe9c185bad3cdfcb64dddf3ec8361c7bfaa", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4f448fe9c185bad3cdfcb64dddf3ec8361c7bfaa", "title": "Assessment of the pattern, severity, and outcomes of acute mood stabilizer drug poisoning.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nMood-stabilizer drugs are associated with a considerable incidence of morbidity and mortality.\n\n\nAIM\nThis study aimed to assess the pattern, severity, and outcomes of poisoning with acute mood stabilizer drugs among admitted patients to Tanta University Poison Control Center, Egypt between January 2021 and September 2023.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nThis cross-sectional study was conducted in patients with acute mood stabilizer drug poisoning. Data from electronic medical records were observed. The poison severity score (PSS) assessed the severity of the patients. Primary outcomes were the pattern and severity assessment. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of mortality, the need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission, the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation, the incidence of complications, and the duration of hospital stay.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 67 patients with acute poisoning of mood stabilizers were included. Poisoning with carbamazepine accounted for 58.2% of all mood stabilizers, followed by valproic acid (29.8%), lithium (7.5%), and lamotrigine (4.5%).

This study reports a phenyltriazine compound that inhibits both Bdf1 BDs from the human fungal pathogen Candida glabrata with selectivity over the orthologous BDs from the human BET protein Brd4. On-target antifungal activity is established by devising two yeast-based inhibition assays: a growth assay using humanized Candida strains in which the Bdf1 BDs are replaced by their Brd4 counterparts, and a NanoBiT assay that evaluates the BD-mediated association of Bdf1 with chromatin. These assays additionally enable the discovery that BET inhibitor I-BET726 targets both Bdf1 BDs, inhibits the growth of a broad spectrum of Candida species, including antifungal-resistant clinical isolates, and displays efficacy in an invertebrate animal model of infection.

However, the results of some studies have suggested that the discontinuation of RAS inhibitors in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease may increase the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or slow its decline.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn this multicenter, open-label trial, we randomly assigned patients with advanced and progressive chronic kidney disease (eGFR, <30 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area) either to discontinue or to continue therapy with RAS inhibitors. The primary outcome was the eGFR at 3 years; eGFR values that were obtained after the initiation of renal-replacement therapy were excluded. Secondary outcomes included the development of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD); a composite of a decrease of more than 50% in the eGFR or the initiation of renal-replacement therapy, including ESKD; hospitalization; blood pressure; exercise capacity; and quality of life. Prespecified subgroups were defined according to age, eGFR, type of diabetes, mean arterial pressure, and proteinuria.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt 3 years, among the 411 patients who were enrolled, the least-squares mean (\u00b1SE) eGFR was 12.6\u00b10.7 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 in the discontinuation group and 13.3\u00b10.6 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 in the continuation group (difference, -0.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], -2.5 to 1.0; P\u2009=\u20090.42), with a negative value favoring the outcome in the continuation group. No heterogeneity in outcome according to the prespecified subgroups was observed. ESKD or the initiation of renal-replacement therapy occurred in 128 patients (62%) in the discontinuation group and in 115 patients (56%) in the continuation group (hazard ratio, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.65).

Design Umbrella review of existing meta-analyses. Data sources PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and hand searching of reference lists. Inclusion criteria Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials, cohort studies, case-control studies, or cross sectional studies that evaluated the effect of dietary sugar consumption on any health outcomes in humans free from acute or chronic diseases. Results The search identified 73 meta-analyses and 83 health outcomes from 8601 unique articles, including 74 unique outcomes in meta-analyses of observational studies and nine unique outcomes in meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials. Significant harmful associations between dietary sugar consumption and 18 endocrine/metabolic outcomes, 10 cardiovascular outcomes, seven cancer outcomes, and 10 other outcomes (neuropsychiatric, dental, hepatic, osteal, and allergic) were detected. Moderate quality evidence suggested that the highest versus lowest dietary sugar consumption was associated with increased body weight (sugar sweetened beverages) (class IV evidence) and ectopic fatty accumulation (added sugars) (class IV evidence). Low quality evidence indicated that each serving/week increment of sugar sweetened beverage consumption was associated with a 4% higher risk of gout (class III evidence) and each 250 mL/day increment of sugar sweetened beverage consumption was associated with a 17% and 4% higher risk of coronary heart disease (class II evidence) and all cause mortality (class III evidence), respectively. In addition, low quality evidence suggested that every 25 g/day increment of fructose consumption was associated with a 22% higher risk of pancreatic cancer (class III evidence). Conclusions High dietary sugar consumption is generally more harmful than beneficial for health, especially in cardiometabolic disease. Reducing the consumption of free sugars or added sugars to below 25 g/day (approximately 6 teaspoons/day) and limiting the consumption of sugar sweetened beverages to less than one serving/week (approximately 200-355 mL/week) are recommended to reduce the adverse effect of sugars on health.

This study aimed to examine the associations of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), artificially-sweetened beverages (ASBs), and natural juices (NJs) with CKD risk, and assess the extent to which the associations were mediated through metabolic syndrome (MetS). Methods This is a prospective analysis of 191,956 participants from the UK Biobank. Participants with information on beverage consumption and no history of CKD at recruitment were included. Daily consumptions of SSBs, ASBs and NJs were measured via 24-h dietary recall. Cox models were fitted to calculate the hazard ratios (HRs) and confidence intervals (CIs) of sugary beverages intakes on CKD risk. The causal mediation analyses were conducted to investigate whether MetS explained the observed associations. Results We documented 4,983 CKD cases over a median of 10.63 years follow-up. Higher consumption of SSBs and ASBs (>1 units/d compared with none) was associated with an elevated risk of CKD (HR: 1.45; 95% CI: 1.30\u20131.61, P-trend < 0.001 for SSBs and 1.52, 95% CI: 1.36\u20131.70 for ASBs). In contrast, we observed a J-shaped association between NJs and CKD with the with lowest risk at 0\u20131 unit/day (0\u20131 unit/d vs. 0, HR 0.86; 95% CI 0.81\u20130.91). The proportions of the observed association of higher intakes of SSBs and ASB with CKD mediated by MetS were 12.5 and 18.0%, respectively.

As a catalytically active dimer, its dimerization interface has become an attractive target for antiviral drug development. Recent research has extensively investigated the enzymatic activity of Mpro, focusing on its role in regulating the coronavirus replication complex and its significance in virus maturation and infectivity. Computational investigations have identified four druggable pockets, suggesting potential allosteric sites beyond the substrate-binding region. Empirical validation through site-directed alanine mutagenesis has targeted residues in both the active and allosteric regions and corroborated these predictions. Structural studies of drug target proteins can inform therapeutic approaches, with metadynamics simulations shedding light on the role of H163 in regulating Mpro function and providing insights into its dynamic equilibrium to the wild-type enzyme. Despite the efficacy of vaccines and drugs in mitigating SARS-CoV-2 spread, its ongoing viral evolution, selective pressures, and continued transmission pose challenges, potentially leading to resistant mutations. Phylogenetic analyses have indicated the existence of several resistant variations predating drug introduction to the human population, emphasizing the likelihood of drug spread. Hydrogen/deuterium-exchange mass spectrometry reveals the structural influence of the mutation. At the same time, clinical trials on 3CLPro inhibitors underscore the clinical significance of reduced enzymatic activity and offer avenues for future therapeutic exploration. Understanding the implications of 3CLPro mutations holds promise for shaping forthcoming therapeutic strategies against COVID-19.

When the nanomedicine was internalized into the tumor cells, ultrasound (US) induced the nanosonosensitizer to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) to achieve sonodynamic therapy (SDT). GSH, acting as a hole trapping agent, improved the efficiency of SDT. Meanwhile, the downgrade of GSH was beneficial to cuproptosis and oxidative damage-based SDT in return. What is more, the US could regulate the release behavior of Cu(I). Cu(I) bonded to mitochondrial proteins and then aggregated the lipoylated protein, bringing about the turbulence of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The combination of SDT and cuproptosis showed high matching to induce efficient cuproptosis and may inspire other cuproptosis-based nanosonosensitizer designs.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-01-30", "synthetic_support_claim": "An ultrasound-triggered nanosonosensitizer induces efficient cuproptosis and sonodynamic therapy in tumor cells.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Cuproptosis-based therapy can universally overcome tumor resistance and be effective for all cancer types."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "dbc9698b821871e65315fc87cde875e626447212", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dbc9698b821871e65315fc87cde875e626447212", "title": "Candidate biomarkers in psychiatric disorders: state of the field", "abstract": "The field of psychiatry is hampered by a lack of robust, reliable and valid biomarkers that can aid in objectively diagnosing patients and providing individualized treatment recommendations. Here we review and critically evaluate the evidence for the most promising biomarkers in the psychiatric neuroscience literature for autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, anxiety disorders and post\u2010traumatic stress disorder, major depression and bipolar disorder, and substance use disorders. Candidate biomarkers reviewed include various neuroimaging, genetic, molecular and peripheral assays, for the purposes of determining susceptibility or presence of illness, and predicting treatment response or safety. This review highlights a critical gap in the biomarker validation process. An enormous societal investment over the past 50 years has identified numerous candidate biomarkers. However, to date, the overwhelming majority of these measures have not been proven sufficiently reliable, valid and useful to be adopted clinically. It is time to consider whether strategic investments might break this impasse, focusing on a limited number of promising candidates to advance through a process of definitive testing for a specific indication. Some promising candidates for definitive testing include the N170 signal, an event\u2010related brain potential measured using electroencephalography, for subgroup identification within autism spectrum disorder; striatal resting\u2010state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measures, such as the striatal connectivity index (SCI) and the functional striatal abnormalities (FSA) index, for prediction of treatment response in schizophrenia; error\u2010related negativity (ERN), an electrophysiological index, for prediction of first onset of generalized anxiety disorder, and resting\u2010state and structural brain connectomic measures for prediction of treatment response in social anxiety disorder. Alternate forms of classification may be useful for conceptualizing and testing potential biomarkers. Collaborative efforts allowing the inclusion of biosystems beyond genetics and neuroimaging are needed, and online remote acquisition of selected measures in a naturalistic setting using mobile health tools may significantly advance the field. Setting specific benchmarks for well\u2010defined target application, along with development of appropriate funding and partnership mechanisms, would also be crucial.

However, the therapeutic effects of PDT are often limited by tumor hypoxia, which prevents effective tumor cell elimination. The oxygen (O2) consumption during PDT can further exacerbate hypoxia, leading to post\u2010treatment adverse events. Objectives This review aims to explore the potential of cuproptosis, a recently discovered copper\u2010dependent form of programmed cell death, to enhance the anticancer effects of PDT. Cuproptosis is highly dependent on mitochondrial respiration, specifically the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and can increase O2 and ROS levels or decrease glutathione (GSH) levels, thereby improving PDT outcomes. Methods The review discusses the latest research advancements in the field, detailing the mechanisms that regulate cuproptosis and PDT. It also explores how nanoparticle (NP)\u2010based strategies can be used to exploit the synergistic potential between cuproptosis and PDT. The article examines the prospects of synergistic anticancer activity guided by nanodelivery systems, which could overcome the challenges associated with hypoxia in cancer treatment. Conclusions The combination of cuproptosis and PDT, facilitated by NP\u2010based delivery systems, presents a promising approach to enhance the effectiveness of cancer therapy.

Osteoimmunological biomarkers have been described as potential indicators of bone remodeling in inflammatory conditions, but their potential role in evaluating the effect of COVID-19 on bone fragility has not been explored so far. Methods The present study aims to measure the osteoimmunological biomarkers in elderly patients undergoing orthopedic surgery, to evaluate the potential effect of COVID-19 on the bone response to the surgery. Results In our patients, the RANKL/OPG ratio indicated an increase of bone resorption in COVID-19-positive patients, confirming a strong diagnostic and prognostic value. RANKL/OPG displays a good correlation with the bone fragility maker FGF23, indicating that this parameter is a reliable maker of bone fragility in COVID-19 patients and could provide useful and comprehensive information about inflammation-induced bone loss. Consistently, the RANKL/OPG ratio showed a good correlation also with the two inflammatory markers IL-6 and sRAGE. Discussion Taken together these results indicate that the use of an osteoimmunological biomarker like the RANKL/OPG ratio could provide a significant improvement in the clinical evaluation of the COVID-19 effect on bone loss.

Numerous studies in humans and animals suggest that diet has the potential to modify the epigenome and these modifications can be inherited transgenerationally, but few studies investigate how diet can protect against negative effects of toxins. Potential evidence in the primary literature supports that caloric restriction, high-fat diets, high protein-to-carbohydrate ratios, and dietary supplementation protect against environmental toxins and strengthen these effects on their offspring's epigenome. Most notably, the timing when dietary interventions are given - during a parent's early development, pregnancy, and/or lifetime - result in similar transgenerational epigenetic durations. This implies the existence of multiple opportunities to strategically fortify the epigenome. This narrative review explores how to best utilize dietary modifications to modify the epigenome to protect future generations against negative health effects of persistent environmental toxins. Furthermore, by suggesting an ideal diet with specific micronutrients, macronutrients, and food groups, epigenetics can play a key role in the field of preventive medicine.

Selective inhibition of aldosterone synthase is essential but difficult to achieve because cortisol synthesis is catalyzed by another enzyme that shares 93% sequence similarity with aldosterone synthase. In preclinical and phase 1 studies, baxdrostat had 100:1 selectivity for enzyme inhibition, and baxdrostat at several dose levels reduced plasma aldosterone levels but not cortisol levels.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn this multicenter, placebo-controlled trial, we randomly assigned patients who had treatment-resistant hypertension, with blood pressure of 130/80 mm Hg or higher, and who were receiving stable doses of at least three antihypertensive agents, including a diuretic, to receive baxdrostat (0.5 mg, 1 mg, or 2 mg) once daily for 12 weeks or placebo. The primary end point was the change in systolic blood pressure from baseline to week 12 in each baxdrostat group as compared with the placebo group.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 248 patients completed the trial. Dose-dependent changes in systolic blood pressure of -20.3 mm Hg, -17.5 mm Hg, -12.1 mm Hg, and -9.4 mm Hg were observed in the 2-mg, 1-mg, 0.5-mg, and placebo groups, respectively. The difference in the change in systolic blood pressure between the 2-mg group and the placebo group was -11.0 mm Hg (95% confidence interval [CI], -16.4 to -5.5; P<0.001), and the difference in this change between the 1-mg group and the placebo group was -8.1 mm Hg (95% CI, -13.5 to -2.8; P\u2009=\u20090.003). No deaths occurred during the trial, no serious adverse events were attributed by the investigators to baxdrostat, and there were no instances of adrenocortical insufficiency.

We argue that a single digital representation of patients cannot support all the data uses of digital twins for technical and regulatory reasons. Instead, we propose a data architecture leveraging three main families of digital representations: (1) multimodal dashboards integrating various raw health records at points of care to assist with perception and documentation, (2) virtual patients, which provide nonsensitive data for collective secondary uses, and (3) individual predictions that support clinical decisions. For a given patient, multiple digital representations may be generated according to the different clinical pathways the patient goes through, each tailored to balance the trade-offs associated with the respective intended uses.

In this work, we have presented rationally designed aggregation-induced emission (AIE)-active cationic cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes derived from 2-phenylquinoline and 2,2'-bipyridine ligands for Gram-positive antibacterial studies. The AIE properties of these complexes were exploited for selective discrimination between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. These complexes displayed good antimicrobial activity against critical Gram-positive ESKAPE pathogens with minimum inhibitory concentrations in the low micromolar range but were inactive against Gram-negative pathogens. Importantly, the complexes can inhibit biofilm formation and eradicate bacteria from mature biofilms, which are major causes of persistent infections and antibiotic resistance and are more difficult to eliminate. In addition, these complexes showed low hemolytic activity against mammalian cells and a high therapeutic index, indicating good selectivity. Interestingly, the complexes kill bacteria through a variety of modes of mechanism, including ROS generation, cell membrane disruption, and depolarization and the loss of bacterial membrane integrity.

Randomization occurred within 4 hours after a patient met the criteria for sepsis-induced hypotension refractory to initial treatment with 1 to 3 liters of intravenous fluid. We hypothesized that all-cause mortality before discharge home by day 90 (primary outcome) would be lower with a restrictive fluid strategy than with a liberal fluid strategy. Safety was also assessed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 1563 patients were enrolled, with 782 assigned to the restrictive fluid group and 781 to the liberal fluid group. Resuscitation therapies that were administered during the 24-hour protocol period differed between the two groups; less intravenous fluid was administered in the restrictive fluid group than in the liberal fluid group (difference of medians, -2134 ml; 95% confidence interval [CI], -2318 to -1949), whereas the restrictive fluid group had earlier, more prevalent, and longer duration of vasopressor use. Death from any cause before discharge home by day 90 occurred in 109 patients (14.0%) in the restrictive fluid group and in 116 patients (14.9%) in the liberal fluid group (estimated difference, -0.9 percentage points; 95% CI, -4.4 to 2.6; P\u2009=\u20090.61); 5 patients in the restrictive fluid group and 4 patients in the liberal fluid group had their data censored (lost to follow-up).

Previous studies have demonstrated the beneficial therapeutic effect of berberine (BBR) on SCM; however, the underlying mechanisms of action remain unclear. The objective of this is to elucidate how BBR alleviates SCM. Methods Septic cardiomyopathy rat model was established by performing cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), while a cardiomyocyte injury model was provoked in H9C2 cells using lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Cardiac function was assessed through echocardiography, and myocardial histopathology was examined with hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. Cardiomyocyte viability was determined through Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) assay, and measurement of ATP levels was done with an ATP assay kit. Mitochondrial ultrastructure was observed using transmission electron microscopy. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting were employed to analyze the expression of Notch1 signaling pathway components and downstream molecules in myocardial tissues and cells. Result In vivo, BBR markedly improved symptoms and cardiac function in SCM rats, leading to enhanced ATP content, and ameliorated mitochondrial structure. Additionally, BBR increased Notch1 protein expression in myocardial tissue of the rats. In vitro, BBR elevated the survival rates of H9C2 cell, improved mitochondrial morphology, and raised ATP levels. The mRNA expression of Notch1, Hes1, and Hes2, and Notch1 protein expression was upregulated by BBR. While these effects were reversed upon inhibiting the Notch1 signaling pathway.

This review provides a comprehensive overview of current strategies for vasopressor and fluid management in septic shock, with the aim to optimize patient outcomes. With regard to vasopressor management, we elaborate on the pharmacologic profiles and clinical applications of catecholamines, vasopressin derivatives, angiotensin II, and other vasoactive agents. Noradrenaline remains central to septic shock management. The addition of vasopressin, when sequentially added to noradrenaline, offers a non-catecholaminergic vasoactive effect with some clinical benefits and risks of adverse effects. Emerging agents such as angiotensin II and hydroxocobalamin are highlighted for their roles in catecholamine-resistant vasodilatory shock. Next, for fluid management, crystalloids are currently preferred for initial resuscitation, with balanced crystalloids showing benefits over saline. The application of albumin in septic shock warrants further research. High-quality evidence does not support large-volume fluid resuscitation, and an individualized strategy based on haemodynamic parameters, including lactate clearance and capillary refill time, is recommended. The existing knowledge suggests that early vasopressor initiation, particularly noradrenaline, may be critical in cases where fluid resuscitation takes inadequate effect. Management of refractory septic shock remains challenging, with novel agents like angiotensin II and methylene blue showing potential in recent studies.

However, theoretical and proven adverse events from probiotic consumption exist. New probiotic strains and products, as well as expanding use of probiotics into vulnerable populations, warrants concise, and actionable recommendations on how to work toward their safe and effective use. The International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics convened a meeting to discuss and produce evidence-based recommendations on potential acute and long-term risks, risks to vulnerable populations, the importance for probiotic product quality to match the needs of vulnerable populations, and the need for adverse event reporting related to probiotic use. The importance of whole genome sequencing, which enables determination of virulence, toxin, and antibiotic resistance genes, as well as clear assignment of species and strain identity, is emphasized. We present recommendations to guide the scientific and medical community on judging probiotic safety. Plain Language Summary What is the context? Probiotics, available to healthy consumers as both dietary supplements and foods, are also used by some patient populations. The goal of this paper is to determine if any new factors have emerged that would impact current views about probiotic safety for both these populations. What is new? The authors conclude that established practices are sensibly addressing factors important to the safety of traditional probiotics used by the general population. They also make recommendations regarding emerging safety considerations. Probiotics targeted for patient populations should undergo stringent testing to meet quality standards appropriate for that population, preferably verified by an independent third party. The safety of probiotics derived from species without a history of safe use must be considered on a case-by-case basis. Research is needed to address some gaps, for example which best animal models to use for safety assessment of live microbes, the possibility of antibiotic resistance gene transfer via transformation, and potential impact of probiotic-induced changes in microbiomes, interactions with drugs, and probiotic colonization. What is the impact? Probiotics of sufficient quality for patient populations are being developed and should be used accordingly. Long-term safety assessments for probiotics should be consistent with, and not more stringent than, current regulatory requirements for biologic drugs, including fecal microbial transplants. Rigor in collecting and reporting data on adverse events is needed.

More importantly, the obtained nanofibrous membrane exhibited ultrahigh stability in different harsh environments. The design of superoleophobic nanofiber membrane with a high separation efficiency and high photocatalytic activity has great potential for practical applications in the purification of oily wastewater.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-12-10", "synthetic_support_claim": "The TiO2/AgNPs/PAN nanofibrous membrane achieves ultrahigh separation efficiency and photocatalytic activity for oily wastewater.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "The TiO2/AgNPs/PAN membrane can effectively remove heavy metals from wastewater."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "8b667542862eadabe7291dbf7bad5b330eb113ee", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8b667542862eadabe7291dbf7bad5b330eb113ee", "title": "Filtration Performance of Biodegradable Electrospun Nanofibrous Membrane for Sub\u2010Micron Particles: A Systematic Review", "abstract": "Nanofiber membranes receive considerable interest recently because of their distinctive structural features, facile preparation, as well as high filtering efficiency. Due to ever\u2010increasing air pollution, membranes made from biodegradable materials can play a crucial part in providing purified air with minimum concerns of environmental issues after the membrane's end of service life. The purpose of this systematic review is to assess the performance\u00a0of biodegradable electrospun nanofibrous membrane filters toward air sub\u2010micron particles. To identify relevant studies, a systematic search is carried out in major scientific search engines including PubMed, Scopus, and the Web of Science. Data extraction is used to collect the necessary information on the membranes' structural properties, as well as filtration performance metrics such as efficiency, pressure drop, and quality factor. Among the electrospun membranes derived from biodegradable polymers, the polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)\u2010based electrospun membranes are more effective in filtration efficiency in capturing sub\u2010micron particles. The results highlight that these types of membranes are effective in filtration with low energy consumption, making them more apt for air purification. The use of such membranes can supply both high filtering performance and protection of the environment.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2024-10-26", "synthetic_support_claim": "Among biodegradable electrospun membranes, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)\u2010based membranes are most effective for sub-micron particle filtration.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Electrospun nanofibrous membrane filters can completely eliminate all airborne pollutants, including viruses and bacteria."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "14959e22a527bcb80e8040f9e602dae7c631727a", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/14959e22a527bcb80e8040f9e602dae7c631727a", "title": "Development of Value-Added Superhydrophobic Fiber as a Highly Selective Oil Filter, Superior Self-Cleaning, and Efficient Oil\u2013Water Separation Material Exhibiting a Significant Number of Life Cycles", "abstract": "The current study attempted to couple acid-treated thermal power station waste fly ash with different weight percentages of phenyltriethoxysilane and deposited on the cotton fabric surfaces in order to get superhydrophobic/superoleophilic materials (TPSWFA/PTES-CF). The contact angle measurements were carried out along with other physiochemical and morphological studies for TPSWFA/PTES-CF materials using a goniometer and showed an average static water angle value of 158.5\u00b0. The wetting behavior of corrosive liquids such as coffee, milk, tea, water-dyed methylene blue, strong acids (HCl), strong alkali (NaOH), and saturated salt solution (NaCl) was assessed for the fabricated TPSWFA/PTES-CF superhydrophobic/superoleophilic substrates using an optical contact angle meter. The wash durability, mechanical stability, oil/water separation, and self-cleaning ability through flushed water were also carried out for the newly developed high-value superhydrophobic TPSWFA/PTES-CFS filter and reported.
