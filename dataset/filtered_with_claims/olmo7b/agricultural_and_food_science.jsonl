In this Review, we discuss the current state of CRISPR-mediated genetic manipulation in human cells, animals, and plants along with relevant successes and challenges and present a roadmap for the future of this technology. Description A decade of CRISPR In the decade since the publication of CRISPR-Cas9 as a genome-editing technology, the CRISPR toolbox and its applications have profoundly changed basic and applied biological research. Wang and Doudna now review the origins and utility of CRISPR-based genome editing, the successes and current limitations of the technology, and where innovation and engineering are needed. The authors describe important advances in the development of CRISPR genome-editing technology and make predictions about where the field is headed. They also highlight specific examples in medicine and agriculture that show how CRISPR is already affecting society, with exciting opportunities for the future. \u2014DJ A review discusses the current state of CRISPR-mediated genetic manipulation in human cells, animals, and plants and considers its future potential. BACKGROUND The fields of molecular biology, genetics, and genomics are at a critical juncture\u2014a moment in history when a convergence of knowledge and methods has made it both technically possible and incredibly useful to edit specific base pairs or segments of DNA in cells and living organisms. The advent of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) genome editing, coupled with advances in computing and imaging capabilities, has initiated a new era in which we can not only diagnose human diseases and even predict individual susceptibility based on personal genetics but also act on that information. Likewise, we can both identify and rapidly alter genes responsible for plant traits, transforming the pace of agricultural research and plant breeding. The applications of this technology convergence are profound and far reaching\u2014and they are happening now. In the decade since the publication of CRISPR-Cas9 as a genome editing technology, the CRISPR toolbox and its applications have profoundly changed biological research, impacting not only patients with genetic diseases but also agricultural practices and products. As a specific example from the field of genomic medicine, it has become feasible to obtain a complete sequence of the human genome in less than 24 hours\u2014a staggering advance considering the first such sequence took 5 years to generate. Notably, designing and putting to use a potent CRISPR genome editor to obtain clinically actionable information from that genome\u2014previously a near-intractable challenge\u2014now takes only a matter of days. For additional background and related topics, we refer readers to in-depth reviews of the microbiology and structural biology of CRISPR systems and to articles about the considerable ethical and societal challenges of this technology. ADVANCES The past decade has witnessed the discovery, engineering, and deployment of RNA-programmed genome editors across many applications. By leveraging CRISPR-Cas9\u2019s most fundamental activity to create a targeted genetic disruption in a gene or gene regulatory element, scientists have built successful platforms for the rapid creation of knockout mice and other animal models, genetic screening, and multiplexed editing. Beyond traditional CRISPR-Cas9\u2013induced knockouts, base editing\u2014a technology utilizing engineered Cas9\u2019s fused to enzymes that alter the chemical nature of DNA bases\u2014has also provided a highly useful strategy to generate site-specific and precise point mutations. Over the past decade, scientists have utilized CRISPR technology as a readily adaptable tool to probe biological function, dissect genetic interactions, and inform strategies to combat human diseases and engineer crops. This Review covers the origins and successes of CRISPR-based genome editing and discusses the most pressing challenges, which include improving editing accuracy and precision, implementing strategies for precise programmable genetic sequence insertions, improving targeted delivery of CRISPR editors, and increasing access and affordability. We examine current efforts addressing these challenges, including emerging gene insertion technologies and new delivery modalities, and describe where further innovation and engineering are needed. CRISPR genome editors are already being deployed in medicine and agriculture, and this Review highlights key examples, including a CRISPR-based therapy treating sickle cell disease, a more nutritious CRISPR-edited tomato, and a high-yield, disease-resistant CRISPR-edited wheat, to illustrate CRISPR\u2019s current and potential future impacts in society. OUTLOOK In the decade ahead, genome editing research and applications will continue to expand and will intersect with advances in technologies, such as machine learning, live cell imaging, and sequencing. A combination of discovery and engineering will diversify and refine the CRISPR toolbox to combat current challenges and enable more wide-ranging applications in both fundamental and applied research. Just as during the advent of CRISPR genome editing, a combination of scientific curiosity and the desire to benefit society will drive the next decade of innovation in CRISPR technology. CRISPR: past, present, and future. The past decade of CRISPR technology has focused on building the platforms for generating gene knockouts, creating knockout mice and other animal models, genetic screening, and multiplexed editing.

Comprehensive efforts and alternative strategies to combat AMR are urgently needed to prevent social, medical, and economic consequences. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a pathogen responsible for a wide range of infections, from soft tissue infections to life-threatening conditions such as bacteremia and pneumonia. Bacteriophages have been considered as a potential therapeutic option to treat bacterial infections. Our aim was to isolate phages able to infect MDR P. aeruginosa strains. Methods: We isolated two lytic phages, using the conventional double layer agar technique (DLA), from samples obtained from the influent of a wastewater treatment plant in Concepci\u00f3n, Chile. The phages, designated as PaCCP1 and PaCCP2, were observed by electron microscopy and their host range was determined against multiple P. aeruginosa strains using DLA. Moreover, their genomes were sequenced and analyzed. Results: Phage PaCCP1 is a member of the Septimatrevirus genus and phage PaCCP2 is a member of the Pbunavirus genus. Both phages are tailed and contain dsDNA. The genome of PaCCP1 is 43,176 bp in length with a GC content of 54.4%, encoding 59 ORFs, one of them being a tRNA gene. The genome of PaCCP2 is 66,333 bp in length with a GC content of 55.6%, encoding 102 non-tRNA ORFs. PaCCP1 is capable of infecting five strains of P. aeruginosa, whereas phage PaCCP2 is capable of infecting three strains of P. aeruginosa. Both phages do not contain bacterial virulence or AMR genes and contain three and six putative Anti-CRISPR proteins.

However, the widespread use of veterinary antimicrobials drives antimicrobial resistance, with important consequences for animal health, and potentially human health. Global monitoring of antimicrobial use is essential: first, to track progress in reducing the reliance of farming on antimicrobials. Second, to identify countries where antimicrobial-stewardship efforts should be targeted to curb antimicrobial resistance. Data on usage of antimicrobials in food animals were collected from 42 countries. Multivariate regression models were used in combination with projections of animal counts for cattle, sheep, chicken, and pigs from the Food and Agriculture Organization to estimate global antimicrobial usage of veterinary antimicrobials in 2020 and 2030. Maps of animal densities were used to identify geographic hotspots of antimicrobial use. In each country, estimates of antimicrobial use (tonnes) were calibrated to match continental-level reports of antimicrobial use intensity (milligrams per kilogram of animal) from the World Organization for Animal Health, as well as country-level reports of antimicrobial use from countries that made this information publicly available. Globally, antimicrobial usage was estimated at 99,502 tonnes (95% CI 68,535\u2013198,052) in 2020 and is projected, based on current trends, to increase by 8.0% to 107,472 tonnes (95% CI: 75,927\u2013202,661) by 2030. Hotspots of antimicrobial use were overwhelmingly in Asia (67%), while <1% were in Africa. Findings indicate higher global antimicrobial usage in 2030 compared to prior projections that used data from 2017; this is likely associated with an upward revision of antimicrobial use in Asia/Oceania (~6,000 tonnes) and the Americas (~4,000 tonnes).

Antibiotics and other pharmaceuticals are increasingly detected in surface groundwater, and drinking water, raising concerns about their potential adverse impacts on ecosystems and human health. Standard wastewater treatment methods often fail to effectively remove these compounds, particularly small organic molecules like tetracycline antibiotics, leading to their persistence in the environment. To address this issue, continuous monitoring and surveillance are necessary, including regular analysis of wastewater. Modern analytical methods, such as high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometric detection (HPLC-MS), allow detecting trace concentrations. This work presents a new method for qualitative and quantitative analysis using a quadrupole mass analyzer, which can serve as an alternative to tandem mass spectrometry. \nMaterials and methods. Tetracycline antibiotics (oxytetracycline, tetracycline, chlortetracycline, and doxycycline) in aquatic environments were detercted using selected ion monitoring (HPLC-MS) and selected reaction monitoring through tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). \nResults. There have been established chromatographic and mass spectrometric criteria for the identification of tetracyclines, determining key operating parameters for the quadrupole, such as selected ion scanning based on mass-to-charge ratio (m/z), signal registration time, and duration. The developed method for analyzing tetracyclines using a quadrupole mass analyzer demonstrates analytical characteristics comparable to tandem mass spectrometry based on a triple quadrupole mass analyzer. The method was validated on a quadrupole mass analyzer during the analysis of water samples from natural sources (drinking water, centralized water supply, and treated wastewater). In this analytical approach, the sample preparation process was simplified, allowing for the assessment of antibiotic content in samples without the need for labour-intensive solid-phase extraction and concentration, starting from 1 ng/ml and above ( for various types of water mactrices). \nLimitations. In this study, only the intact forms of tetracyclines were identified. Separate investigations into the detection of their chemical transformation products and epimerization were not conducted. The presented approach can be applied for analyzing wastewater and assessing the quality of its treatment, where the concentration of tetracycline antibiotics as micro-pollutants may exceed 10 ng/ml. \nConclusion. The proposed analytical method using a single quadrupole mass analyzer can serve as an alternative to the more expensive tandem mass spectrometer, both in terms of acquisition cost and maintenance. Key analytical characteristics that are important for environmental monitoring, such as selectivity and sensitivity, can be enhanced by optimizing the selected ion scanning mode. This was successfully demonstrated in the analysis of tetracyclines in aquatic environments. This approach could serve as a foundation for developing methodologies for detecting pharmaceutical compounds in environmental water samples using a quadrupole mass spectrometer.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-01-31", "synthetic_support_claim": "The quadrupole mass analyzer method effectively identifies tetracycline antibiotics in water comparable to tandem mass spectrometry.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "The new method can replace all current water quality monitoring techniques for detecting pharmaceuticals."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "4deab1fec9281a63d2d5695a0f81e5083bfe0dc6", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4deab1fec9281a63d2d5695a0f81e5083bfe0dc6", "title": "Artificial Intelligence-Based Robust Hybrid Algorithm Design and Implementation for Real-Time Detection of Plant Diseases in Agricultural Environments", "abstract": "Simple Summary Plant disease, defined as an abnormal condition that disrupts the normal growth of the plant, is one of the main causes of economic losses in the agricultural industry. Early diagnosis of plant disease is critical to increasing agricultural crop productivity. In this paper, a new robust hybrid classification model based on swarm optimization-supported feature selection, including machine learning and deep learning algorithms, that allows real-time classification of diseases in apple, grape, and tomato plants has been developed. In this way, it will be possible to diagnose the plant disease at an early phase and apply the appropriate treatment. Abstract The early detection and prevention of plant diseases that are an important cause of famine and food insecurity worldwide are very important for increasing agricultural product productivity. Not only the early detection of the plant disease but also the determination of its type play a critical role in determining the appropriate treatment. The fact that visual inspection, which is frequently used in determining plant disease and types, is tiring and prone to human error, necessitated the development of algorithms that can automatically classify plant disease with high accuracy and low computational cost. In this study, a new hybrid plant leaf disease classification model with high accuracy and low computational complexity, consisting of the wrapper approach, including the flower pollination algorithm (FPA) and support vector machine (SVM), and a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier, is developed with a wrapper-based feature selection approach using metaheuristic optimization techniques. The features of the image dataset consisting of apple, grape, and tomato plants have been extracted by a two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform (2D-DWT) using wavelet families such as biorthogonal, Coiflets, Daubechies, Fejer\u2013Korovkin, and symlets. Features that keep classifier performance high for each family are selected by the wrapper approach, consisting of the population-based metaheuristics FPA and SVM. The performance of the proposed optimization algorithm is compared with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Afterwards, the classification performance is obtained by using the lowest number of features that can keep the classification performance high for the CNN classifier. The CNN classifier with a single layer of classification without a feature extraction layer is used to minimize the complexity of the model and to deal with the model hyperparameter problem. The obtained model is embedded in the NVIDIA Jetson Nano developer kit on the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and real-time classification tests are performed on apple, grape, and tomato plants. The experimental results obtained show that the proposed model classifies the specified plant leaf diseases in real time with high accuracy. Moreover, it is concluded that the robust hybrid classification model, which is created by selecting the lowest number of features with the optimization algorithm with low computational complexity, can classify plant leaf diseases in real time with precision.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-11-29", "synthetic_support_claim": "The robust hybrid model classifies apple, grape, and tomato plant diseases in real time accurately.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "The model can diagnose plant diseases in all types of plants, not just apple, grape, and tomato."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "cda1e218bccc8173a50efa48c4bf28cde007819f", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cda1e218bccc8173a50efa48c4bf28cde007819f", "title": "General retrieval network model for multi-class plant leaf diseases based on hashing", "abstract": "Traditional disease retrieval and localization for plant leaves typically demand substantial human resources and time.

There is a need to conserve and maintain the genetic diversity of these valuable resources for sustainable food security. Due to environmental changes and genetic erosion, some valuable genetic resources have already become extinct. The landraces, wild relatives, wild species, genetic stock, advanced breeding material, and modern varieties are some of the important plant genetic resources. These diverse resources have contributed to maintaining sustainable biodiversity. New crop varieties with desirable traits have been developed using these resources. Novel genes/alleles linked to the trait of interest are transferred into the commercially cultivated varieties using biotechnological tools. Diversity should be maintained as a genetic resource for the sustainable development of new crop varieties.

Through genome association analysis of sorghum, a naturally high-alkaline\u2013tolerant crop, we detected a major locus, Alkaline Tolerance 1 (AT1), specifically related to alkaline-salinity sensitivity. An at1 allele with a carboxyl-terminal truncation increased sensitivity, whereas knockout of AT1 increased tolerance to alkalinity in sorghum, millet, rice, and maize. AT1 encodes an atypical G protein \u03b3 subunit that affects the phosphorylation of aquaporins to modulate the distribution of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). These processes appear to protect plants against oxidative stress by alkali. Designing knockouts of AT1 homologs or selecting its natural nonfunctional alleles could improve crop productivity in sodic lands. Description Growth on alkaline soils Alkaline soils limit the ability of plants to take in nutrients and manage salt stress. Zhang et al. have now identified a locus in sorghum that determines sensitivity to salty alkaline soils. The Alkali Tolerance 1 (AT1) locus encodes a guanine nucleotide\u2013binding protein gamma subunit that regulates the phosphorylation of aquaporins, channels that can transport hydrogen peroxide to alleviate oxidative stress. Crops that could better manage growth on alkaline soils could open up agriculture to the millions of hectares of alkaline soils. \u2014PJH Regulation of phosphorylation on aquaporin underlies the ability of sorghum to tolerate alkaline soils. INTRODUCTION According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), there are currently >1 billion ha of land affected by salt. Among these, ~60% are classified as sodic soil areas. These have high pH and are dominated by sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) and sodium carbonate (Na2CO3). The effects of global warming and a lack of fresh water will lead to >50% of arable land becoming affected by salt by 2050, thus severely affecting the world\u2019s food security. Identifying and/or engineering sodic-tolerant crops is imperative to solve this challenge. Although salinity tolerance has been studied extensively, alkalinity tolerance in plants has not been studied in depth. RATIONALE Sorghum originates from Africa, where it can grow in harsh environments. As a result, sorghum has evolved greater tolerance to adapt to multiple abiotic stresses compared with other crops. Some sorghum varieties can survive in sodic soil with a pH as high as 10.0. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis was performed with a large sorghum association panel consisting of 352 representative sorghum accessions. We detected a major locus, Alkaline tolerance 1 (AT1), linked to alkaline tolerance. We found that AT1, encoding an atypical G protein \u03b3 subunit (a homolog to rice GS3), contributes to alkaline sensitivity by modulating the efflux of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) under environmental stress. RESULTS On the basis of the results of the GWAS analysis, we sequenced the cDNA regions of SbAT1 (Sorghum bicolor AT1) in 37 sorghum accessions with different degrees of alkaline sensitivity. Two typical haplotypes (Hap1 and Hap2) of SbAT1 were identified according to the five leading variant sites associated with sorghum alkali sensitivity. Hap1 encodes an intact SbAT1. A frame shift mutation (from \u201cG\u201d to \u201cGGTGGC\u201d) within Hap2 results in a premature stop codon probably encoding a truncated protein with only 136 amino acids at the N terminus (named Sbat1). To confirm the function of the AT1 locus, we generated a pair of near-isogenic lines (NILs) with two AT1 haplotypes to assess the allelic effect of AT1 on sorghum tolerance to alkali. We found that the Sbat1 allele (Hap2), encoding a truncated form of SbAT1, increased plant alkaline sensitivity compared with wild-type full-length SbAT1 (Hap1). Overexpression of AT1/GS3 reduced alkaline tolerance in sorghum and rice, and overexpression of the C-terminal truncated AT1/GS3 showed a more severe alkaline sensitive response. This was confirmed in millet and rice, which suggests that AT1/GS3 functions negatively in plant alkali tolerance. By contrast, knockout (ko) of AT1/GS3 increased tolerance to alkaline stress in sorghum, millet, rice, and maize, which indicates a conserved pathway in monocot crops. By immunoprecipitation in combination with mass spectrometry (IP-MS), we found that AT1/GS3 interacts with aquaporin PIP2s that are involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis. Genetic analysis showed that OsPIP2;1ko/2;2ko had lower alkaline tolerance than their wild-type control. The redox probe Cyto-roGFP2-Orp1 sensing H2O2 in the cytoplasm was applied. The results showed that, upon alkaline treatment, the relative H2O2 level increased in OsPIP2;1ko/2;2ko compared with wild-type plants. These results suggested that the phosphorylation of aquaporins could modulate the efflux of H2O2. G\u03b3 negatively regulates the phosphorylation of PIP2;1, leading to elevated ROS levels in plants under alkaline stress. To assess the application of the AT1/GS3 gene for crop production, field tests were carried out. We found that the nonfunctional mutant, either obtained from natural varieties or generated by gene editing in several monocots, including sorghum, millet, rice, and maize, can improve the field performance of crops in terms of biomass or grain production when cultivated on sodic lands. CONCLUSION We concluded that SbAT1 encodes an atypical G protein \u03b3 subunit and inhibits the phosphorylation of aquaporins that may be used as H2O2 exporters under alkaline stress. With this knowledge, genetically engineered crops with knockouts of AT1 homologs or use of natural nonfunctional alleles could greatly improve crop yield in sodic lands. This may contribute to maximizing the use of global sodic lands to ensure food security. Genetic modification of AT1 enhances alkaline stress tolerance. The G\u03b3 subunit, AT1, pairs with G\u03b2 to negatively modulate the phosphorylation level of PIP2 aquaporins. Thus, AT1 reduces the H2O2 export activity of PIP2s, leading to the overaccumulation of H2O2 and resulting in alkaline stress sensitivity. By contrast, the artificial or natural knockouts of AT1 homologs release the inhibition of PIP2s by AT1 in crops and have improved survival rates and yield under alkaline stress.

Therefore, this work found that the current design trends in food packaging are toward sustainability, reducing packaging complexity, with easier recycling, and material selection that combines both sustainability and functionality. In the case of bioplastics as a sustainable alternative, there is still room for improvement in their production, with careful consideration of their raw materials.

Drought stress (DS) is a formidable obstacle, disrupting normal plant functions through specific morphological, physiological, biochemical, and molecular mechanisms. Understanding how plants navigate DS is paramount to mitigating its adverse effects. In response to DS, plants synthesize or accumulate various plant growth regulators (PGRs), including phytohormones, neurotransmitters, gasotransmitters, and polyamines, which present promising sustainable green chemical strategies to adapt or tolerate stress conditions. These PGRs orchestrate crucial plant structure and function adjustments, activating defense systems and modulating cellular-level responses, transcript levels, transcription factors, metabolic genes, and stress-responsive candidate proteins. However, the efficacy of these molecules in mitigating DS depends on the plant species, applied PGR dose, treatment type, duration of DS exposure, and growth stages. Thus, exploring the integrated impact of PGRs on enhancing plant fitness and DS tolerance is crucial for global food security and sustainable agriculture. This review investigates plant responses to DS, explains the potential of exogenously applied diverse PGRs, dissects the complex chemistry among PGRs, and sheds light on omics approaches for harnessing the molecular basis of DS tolerance.

Decreasing the emissions of enteric CH4 from ruminant production is strategic to limit the global temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C by 2050. Research in the area of enteric CH4 mitigation has grown exponentially in the last 2 decades, with various strategies for enteric CH4 abatement being investigated: production intensification, dietary manipulation (including supplementation and processing of concentrates and lipids, and management of forage and pastures), rumen manipulation (supplementation of ionophores, 3-nitrooxypropanol, macroalgae, alternative electron acceptors, and phytochemicals), and selection of low-CH4-producing animals. Other enteric CH4 mitigation strategies are at earlier stages of research but rapidly developing. Herein, we discuss and analyze the current status of available enteric CH4 mitigation strategies with an emphasis on opportunities and barriers to their implementation in confined and partial grazing production systems, and in extensive and fully grazing production systems. For each enteric CH4 mitigation strategy, we discuss its effectiveness to decrease total CH4 emissions and emissions on a per animal product basis, safety issues, impacts on the emissions of other greenhouse gases, as well as other economic, regulatory, and societal aspects that are key to implementation. Most research has been conducted with confined animals, and considerably more research is needed to develop, adapt, and evaluate antimethanogenic strategies for grazing systems. In general, few options are currently available for extensive production systems without feed supplementation. Continuous research and development are needed to develop enteric CH4 mitigation strategies that are locally applicable. Information is needed to calculate carbon footprints of interventions on a regional basis to evaluate the impact of mitigation strategies on net greenhouse gas emissions. Economically affordable enteric CH4 mitigation solutions are urgently needed. Successful implementation of safe and effective antimethanogenic strategies will also require delivery mechanisms and adequate technical support for producers, as well as consumer involvement and acceptance.

Along with this process, recommendations are provided on how to account for the mitigation potential at the animal level, as well as in farm-scale models, emissions trading schemes, life cycle assessment, and carbon (C) footprinting tools, and in regional and national inventories. In addition, an assessment of uncertainties and potential trade-offs and off-setting with the use of AMFA (i.e., efficacy vs. effectiveness, upstream and downstream emissions) is provided. The accounting of on-farm enteric CH4 emissions and benefits from the use of AMFA starts with the ruminant animal (with estimates obtained from a range of approaches, from simple empirical emission factors or equations to complex process-based models) and goes all the way to national and supranational accounting. The choice of methodologies and levels of complexity to account for mitigation of enteric CH4 (or total GHG) emissions in livestock systems must be tailored to the scale of analysis aimed, the availability of input data to represent contextualized conditions, and the accounting objectives (e.g., academic exercise vs. producer's GHG certification vs. national GHG inventory). The accounting of enteric CH4 mitigating effects needs to consider the AMFA delivery methods and synergies and trade-offs of GHG emissions at levels before and beyond (upstream and downstream) the animal to fully assess the impact of AMFA use.

This study aimed to investigate the comprehensive chemical profile and biological activities, particularly the antimalarial activity, of Lycium shawii (Awsaj), a shrub traditionally used in the Arabian Peninsula, Middle East, India, and Africa to treat a myriad of ailments. Methods: Crude extracts of L. shawii were prepared using water, ethanol, methanol, and acetone. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (MS) were utilized to perform untargeted metabolomics to maximize metabolite detection and tentatively identify bioactive phytochemicals. The total phenolic content (TPC) was measured for each extract, and bioassays were conducted to evaluate their antimalarial, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory activities, particularly those of the water extract, which is the traditional method of consumption in Arabian folk medicine. Results: A total of 148 metabolites were detected, 45 of which were classified as phytochemicals. The bioassays revealed that the water extract that is traditionally used showed promising antimalarial potential by significantly inhibiting \u03b2-hematin formation in vitro at 1 mg/mL (with an absorbance of 0.140 \u00b1 0.027). This is likely due to the rich presence of quinoline in the aqueous extract among several other bioactive phytochemicals, such as phenylpropanoids, alkaloids, flavonoids, and benzenoids. However, their anti-inflammatory and antibacterial activities were found to be weak, with only a minor inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) production in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells at a concentration of 500 \u00b5g/mL and weak antibacterial effects against pathogens like P. aeruginosa, MRSA, A. baumannii, and K. pneumoniae with an MIC of 500 \u03bcg/mL.

This study investigated the priming potential of two priming agents, avirulent Puccinia triticina (Pt) isolates and salicylic acid (SA), against RWA infestation. The priming effect of Pt isolates and SA in reducing RWA-induced leaf damage and increased antioxidant activities is an indication of defence responses.

Future climatic predictions showed a significant increase in temperature, and erratic rainfall with higher intensity while variability exists in climatic patterns for climate extremes prediction. For mid-century (2040\u20132069), it is projected that there will be a rise of 2.8\u00b0C in maximum temperature and a 2.2\u00b0C in minimum temperature in Pakistan. To respond to the adverse effects of climate change scenarios, there is a need to optimize the climate-smart and resilient agricultural practices and technology for sustainable productivity. Therefore, a case study was carried out to quantify climate change effects on rice and wheat crops and to develop adaptation strategies for the rice-wheat cropping system during the mid-century (2040\u20132069) as these two crops have significant contributions to food production.

The reactions between free radicals and other micro-macro-molecules have some benefit but more generally, have been associated with subclinical disease development and suppressed farm animal performances. Subsequently, this may lead to animal-sourced food products having lower quality and shorter shelf-life (off-farm, e.g., meat and milk products). Free radicals are generated from regulated and unregulated sources (e.g., mitochondrial respiration, enzymatic activities, electron leakage), and their responsiveness to environmental and nutritional stressor events overwhelms the antioxidant defenses in the body maintain redox homeostasis, thus leading to oxidative distress. Research has demonstrated that dietary antioxidants may be used to redress redox imbalance and that, in this function, bioactive compounds will offer different efficacies and effects both on- and off-farm. Important dietary antioxidants include vitamins, trace elements, some fatty acids, and phytonutrients, such as beta-carotene, polyphenols, flavonoids, etc. These may be sourced via the feeds, supplements, and forages provided to farm animals, available from natural or synthetic (additive) sources. Antioxidant accumulation within body tissues of farm animals can support better animal performance and improved meat and milk quality with extended shelf-life. Once consumed, these enriched products may help ameliorate human oxidative stress. These were the topics of this review below. Abstract The biological effects of oxidative stress and associated free radicals on farm animal performance, productivity, and product quality may be managed via dietary interventions\u2014specifically, the provision of feeds, supplements, and forages rich in antioxidants. To optimize this approach, it is important first to understand the development of free radicals and their contributions to oxidative stress in tissue systems of farm animals or the human body. The interactions between prooxidants and antioxidants will impact redox homeostasis and, therefore, the well-being of farm animals. The impact of free radical formation on the oxidation of lipids, proteins, DNA, and biologically important macromolecules will likewise impact animal performance, meat and milk quality, nutritional value, and longevity. Dietary antioxidants, endogenous antioxidants, and metal-binding proteins contribute to the \u2018antioxidant defenses\u2019 that control free radical formation within the biological systems. Different bioactive compounds of varying antioxidant potential and bio-accessibility may be sourced from tailored feeding systems.

Free radicals are thought to be neutralized by these substances, which include polyphenols, \u03b2-carotene, and vitamins C and E, reducing cellular damage. On the other hand, recent data indicates that consuming excessive amounts of antioxidants may have side effects. Apoptosis and cell signaling are two beneficial physiological processes that are affected by excessive supplementation. Other negative effects include paradoxical enhancement of oxidative stress and unbalanced cellular redox potential. Overdosing on particular antioxidants has been associated with increased medication interactions, cancer progression, and fatality risks. Additionally, the complex impacts they may have on fertility might be both useful and adverse, depending on the quantity and duration of usage. This review delves into the dual role of antioxidants and emphasizes the importance of employing antioxidants in moderation. Antioxidant overconsumption may disrupt the oxidative balance necessary for normal sperm and oocyte function, which is one of the potential negative effects of antioxidants on fertility in both males and females that are also investigated. Although modest usage of antioxidants is generally safe and useful, high levels of antioxidants can upset hormonal balance, impair sperm motility, and negatively impact the outcomes of assisted reproductive technologies (ART).

A total of 30 Braford steers were utilized in the study. Of these, 15 animals were supplemented with corn silage for 120 days, while the remaining animals were fed exclusively on pasture. LTL steak samples were aged for 2, 7, 14, and 21 days at a temperature of 2 \u00b1 1\u00b0C, under conditions of darkness and vacuum. Several colorimetric assays were employed to evaluate the antioxidant capacity of both enzymatic and non-enzymatic origin, as well as the levels of protein and lipid oxidation. The content of heme pigment was determined by a spectrophotometric assay, while the fluorescence fingerprint of beef was evaluated by fluorescence spectroscopy excitation-emission matrices (FEEM). Additionally, the muscle microstructure was analyzed via scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results demonstrated that the finishing system did not exert any discernible influence on the rates of lipid oxidation, antioxidant capacity, or muscle microstructure. However, the carbonyl content and total myoglobin exhibited higher levels in the corn silage-supplemented animals. Conversely, during aging period, data revealed that lipid degradation proceeded at a faster rate than protein oxidation, accompanied by a notable enhancement in antioxidant capacity within the hydrophilic meat extracts. In contrast, the lipophilic extracts demonstrated a reduction in both enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant capabilities with the progression of post mortem aging. The aforementioned alterations were accompanied by a reduction in the muscle microstructure during the aging process. The results demonstrate that finishing steers with or without corn silage over 120 days results in comparable and satisfactory beef quality after 21 days of vacuum aging. It can be concluded that 21 days of storage compensates the antioxidant status obtained by feeding strategies in fresh meat.

Given that the pathogenesis of many diseases involves oxidative stress and inflammation, this study aimed to evaluate the potential antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of the plant extracts in 3T3-L1 cells. Methods: Phytochemical screening of C. nardus extracts was performed to identify bioactive compounds. Antioxidant activity of the extract was assessed using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) assays. Toxicity was evaluated using the MTT assay. Additionally, the effects of the extract on the gene expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) in menadione-induced 3T3-L1 cells, as well as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced 3T3-L1 cells, were investigated. Results: Phytochemical screening revealed the presence of phenolics, tannins, alkaloids, and flavonoids in the ethanolic extracts. The extract demonstrated antioxidant activity, with IC 50 values of 178.06 ppm for DPPH and 220 ppm for SOD. It did not affect the viability of 3T3-L1 cells at concentrations of up to 500 ppm. At 100 ppm, the extract increased cell viability (p<0.05) and reduced HIF-1\u03b1 expression in the menadione-treated cells (p<0.05). Additionally, it decreased the expression of IL-6 and COX-2 in LPS-induced cells (p<0.05).

This paper presents a comparative analysis of the adoption of robotics in agriculture across these regions, exploring the current practices, limitations, and advancements shaping the future of sustainable farming. In Africa, limited infrastructure, high costs, and technological barriers hinder the integration of robotics, challenging smallholder farmers and reducing productivity. Conversely, the EU demonstrates more advanced adoption, supported by robust policy frameworks and technology infrastructure, although it faces challenges including workforce aging and the need for ethical guidelines in AI applications. This study highlights significant case studies within the EU, such as those in the Netherlands and Germany, showcasing the economic and environmental impacts of robotics in diverse farming models. The analysis extends to the benefits of robotics in increasing productivity and resource efficiency while reducing labor dependency, contributing to precision farming practices and environmental sustainability. The findings underscore the critical role of robotics in future agricultural systems, suggesting that while Africa faces more immediate barriers to adoption, targeted investments and policy adaptations could bridge these gaps.

This study aimed to assess the determinants of food security among internally displaced persons (IDPs)\u2014people who have been forced to flee their homes due to conflict, natural disasters, or other crises\u2014and their children under five, as well as the influence on their nutritional status. Using random sampling, the caregivers of IDPs and children under five in households were included in the study. The caregivers were interviewed using a validated structured questionnaire, while nutritional assessments of both children and adults were conducted through anthropometric and clinical evaluation methods. The findings revealed a high prevalence of food insecurity, with 97.6% of IDP households experiencing some degree of insecurity. Additionally, 28.3% of the surveyed households had high dietary diversity. Among the children, 50.6% were stunted, over a third were underweight, and 15.8% were wasted, indicating severe nutritional deficiencies. Among adults, 28.4% were overweight or obese, while a significant number were underweight. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the caregivers\u2019 monthly salary and the average amount spent on food were associated with a decrease in food insecurity. Conversely, large household sizes and coping strategies employed to mitigate food insecurity were linked to increased food insecurity. In conclusion, the study highlights a high prevalence of food insecurity among IDP households, forcing families to adopt coping strategies, mainly through dietary modifications. This, in turn, contributes to low dietary diversity and poor nutritional status, with children suffering from underweight, wasting, and stunting. These findings underscore the urgent need for comprehensive interventions, including the distribution of food vouchers, cash transfers, food banks, and support for home gardening and small-scale farming, as well as education on meal rationing, meal planning, and family planning services. Addressing the root causes of food insecurity\u2014namely low household income and large family sizes\u2014can improve access to nutritious food and ensure the health and well-being of IDPs. Furthermore, addressing food insecurity within this vulnerable group is critical to the broader goals of planetary health, as it highlights the intersection of human health, social equity, and environmental sustainability.

As a critical regulator of oxidative stress and metabolic adaptation, Nrf2 mediates the benefits of these interventions. This article presents an innovative approach to understanding the role of Nrf2 in the regulation of oxidative stress and inflammation, highlighting its potential in the prevention and treatment of various diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, diabetes, inflammatory conditions, ageing, and infections such as COVID-19. The novelty of this study is to investigate the synergistic effects of bioactive compounds found in functional foods (such as polyphenols, flavonoids, and vitamins) and exercise-induced oxidative stress on the activation of the Nrf2 pathway. This combined approach reveals their potential to improve insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism and reduce inflammation, offering a promising strategy for the management of chronic diseases. However, there are significant gaps in current research, particularly regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between diet, physical activity, and Nrf2 activation, as well as their long-term effects in different populations, including those with chronic diseases. In addition, the interactions between Nrf2 and other critical signalling pathways, including AMPK, NF-\u03baB, and PI3K/Akt, and their collective contributions to metabolic health are explored. Furthermore, novel biomarkers are presented to assess the impact of these synergistic strategies, such as the NAD+/NADH ratio, the GSH ratio, and markers of mitochondrial health. The findings provide valuable insights into how the integration of an antioxidant-rich diet and regular exercise can improve metabolic health by activating Nrf2 and related molecular pathways and represent promising strategies for the prevention and treatment of metabolic disorders.

To improve drug integration, ethanol was added to the binary-solvent system. This results in several important data: noticeable shifts in the solvent system\u2019s solubility parameter, the interaction of the various component forces, and optical and rheological properties of the PVA-CS solution.

FR\u2010enriched light induced the typical shade avoidance syndrome characterized by enhanced length of seedling hypocotyl and leaf petiole. FR supplementation also caused a noticeable decrease in the carotenoid and chlorophyll content that was attributable to a block of pigment accumulation during plant development. The carotenoid decrease resulted from a downregulation of their biosynthesis pathway rather than carotenoid degradation. The losses of photosynthetic pigments are part of structural and functional rearrangements of the photosynthetic apparatus. The plastoquinone pool was chronically more oxidized in plants acclimated to white + FR light compared to white light\u2010grown plants. Growth in FR\u2010enriched light was associated with a higher photochemical efficiency of PSII compared to growth in white light and with a substantial increase in root and shoot biomass production. Light distribution between the photosystems was modified in favor of PSII by an increase in the PSII/PSI ratio and an inhibition of state transitions. Neither LHCII abundance nor nonphotochemical energy dissipation in the PSII chlorophyll antennae were modified significantly by the addition of FR light. A PSI supercomplex, not previously observed in Arabidopsis, was specifically found in plants grown in FR\u2010enriched light. This large PSI complex contains a supplementary Lhca1\u20104 dimer, leading to a total of 6 LHCI antennae instead of 4 in the canonical PSI.

In this study we compared the performance of four cereal\u2013legume mixed crops (wheat and oat mixed with lupin and lentil in pairs) with their respective monocrops.

We also confirmed that seed adaptation to a particular type of cropping is clearly a determining factor in its performance.

The main encapsulation methods investigated in the study include both physical and chemical ones, such as freeze-drying, spray-drying, extrusion, coacervation, complexation, and supercritical anti-solvent drying. Consequently, in the food area, bioactive peptides, vitamins, essential oils, caffeine, plant extracts, fatty acids, flavonoids, carotenoids, and terpenes are the main compounds encapsulated. In the agricultural area, essential oils, lipids, phytotoxins, medicines, vaccines, hemoglobin, and microbial metabolites are the main compounds encapsulated. Most scientific investigations have one or more objectives, such as to improve the stability of formulated systems, increase the release time, retain and protect active properties, reduce lipid oxidation, maintain organoleptic properties, and present bioactivities even in extreme thermal, radiation, and pH conditions. Considering the increasing worldwide interest for biomolecules in modern and sustainable agriculture, encapsulation can be efficient for the formulation of biofungicides, biopesticides, bioherbicides, and biofertilizers.

The samples were evaluated for microbiological safety, proximal composition, physicochemical properties, sensory characteristics, and carbon footprint. The key findings revealed that the plant-based patties had the smallest carbon footprint (0.12 kg CO2e), followed by the hybrid patties (0.87 kg CO2e) and the meat patties (1.62 kg CO2e). The hybrid patties showed increased hardness, cohesiveness, gumminess, and chewiness compared to the meat patties after sous vide treatment.

Messaging around the ingredients in food products accounts for the largest share, e.g., \u201c100% whole grain\u201d, \u201cVegan\u201d, and \u201cNo artificial preservatives\u201d. The macronutrients of fat, fiber, cholesterol, salt, sugar, and protein are the focus of most messaging around health benefits. The degree of food processing and essential vitamin, mineral, and phytochemical micronutrients receive little or no attention, despite their importance in positive health outcomes. Conclusions: Current nutrition-related labeling fails to inform consumers of the enormous differences in the contribution of food products in meeting nutritional needs. Existing metrics and rating systems do not effectively account for the critical relationship between nutrient density and caloric content. Existing metrics and systems do not reflect the impacts of processing on food nutritional quality in ways that provide consumers meaningful information. New concepts, metrics, and label elements are described that could promote healthier dietary patterns. Clear and mandatory nutrition labeling could begin shifting market share toward healthier options, and this could trigger and guide changes in manufactured food recipes that make brand-name products healthier, benefiting all consumers.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-10-24", "synthetic_support_claim": "US food products have, on average, more nutrition-related messages on packaging compared to EU products.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "\"Mandatory nutrition labeling will significantly reduce the consumption of unhealthy, heavily processed foods worldwide.\""}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "cb535fe38128b3561f3819a6847a476a76ce281c", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cb535fe38128b3561f3819a6847a476a76ce281c", "title": "Mineral profile of cow's milk and plant-based milk alternatives (PBMA).", "abstract": "Some consumers are replacing cow's milk by plant-based milk alternatives (PBMA), however the current knowledge regarding the mineral profile of PBMA is limited.

Exploring crops that can thrive under saline conditions is crucial to ensuring food security. Although brackish and seawater is abundant, it is generally unsuitable for irrigation. However, some plants exhibit tolerance to moderate levels of salinity. This study investigated the effects of varying light intensities (150 and 250 photosynthetic photon flux densities) and salinity levels (<1.5, 5, 10, and 17 parts per thousand, equivalent to <26, 86, 171, and 291 millimolars) on the growth and nutrient composition of Russian kale (Brassica oleracea) grown in indoor hydroponics. The experiment was conducted over five months, from September 2023 to January 2024. The results revealed that a light intensity of 250 PPFD and salinity levels of <1.5\u20135 ppt (<26\u201386 mM) were optimal for maximizing the biomass yield of the kale, whereas a significant reduction in the yield was observed at salinity levels exceeding 10 ppt (171 mM). In contrast, the dry matter percentage was significantly higher at 17 ppt (291 mM). The macronutrient contents, particularly the total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), total phosphorus (TP), and magnesium (Mg), were consistent across both light intensities (150\u2013250 PPFDs) and at salinity levels between <1.5 and 10 ppt (<26\u2013171 mM) but were reduced at 17 ppt (291 mM). The micronutrient concentrations, such as those of copper (Cu), iron (Fe), and zinc (Zn), were higher at the lower light intensity (150 PPFD) across the salinity levels.

Utilizing by-products, particularly fruit peels that are rich in fiber, antioxidants, and vitamins, presents a sustainable approach to reducing waste, while enhancing the nutritional value of food products. Specifically, peach peel can be used to produce gluten-free flours, with increased fiber content and antioxidant properties. Extrusion technology is a highly effective method for developing these functional flours, as it improves digestibility, reduces anti-nutrients, and enhances nutrient bioavailability. This study investigates the potential of combining corn flour with peach peel flour, derived from Royal Summer peachs (RSF), at different concentrations (0%, 5%, and 15%). A factorial experimental design was utilized to evaluate the impact of RSF incorporation on the proximate composition, antioxidant capacity, and functional properties of the flour. The results indicate that flours containing 15% RSF demonstrated significant improvements in terms of the dietary fiber content (5.90 g per 100 g\u22121) and antioxidant capacity (ABTS\u2022+ 745.33 \u00b5mol TE per 100 g\u22121), meeting the \u201csource of fiber\u201d labelling requirements. The glycemic index of the 15% RSF flour was reduced to 78.09 compared to non-enriched flours. The functional properties of the flour, such as swelling and gelation capacities, were also enhanced with RSF incorporation. These findings highlight the potential of RSF-enriched flours in regard to the development of sustainable, health-promoting, plant-based, and gluten-free flours.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-01-27", "synthetic_support_claim": "Flour with 15% peach peel increases dietary fiber and antioxidant capacity, reducing glycemic index to 78.09.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Peach peel flour can significantly lower cholesterol levels when incorporated into daily diets."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "2acb6318074aef9bbf00fae6695655bbaa64e221", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2acb6318074aef9bbf00fae6695655bbaa64e221", "title": "Flavor formation based on lipid in meat and meat products: A review.", "abstract": "Meat product is popular throughout the world due to its unique taste. Flavor is one of the most important quality characteristics of meat products and also is a key influencing factor in the overall acceptability of meat products. The flavor of meat products is formed by precursors undergoing a series of complex reactions. During meat product processing, lipids are hydrolyzed by lipase to produce flavor precursors such as free fatty acid, then further oxidized to form volatile flavor compounds. This review summarizes lipolysis, lipid oxidation, and interaction of lipid with Maillard reaction and amino acid during meat products processing and storage as well as influencing factors on lipid degradation including raw meat (source of meat, feeding pattern, and castration), processing methods (thermal processing, nonthermal processing, salting, and fermentation) and additives. Meanwhile, the volatile compounds produced by lipids in meat products including aldehydes, alcohols, ketones, and hydrocarbons are summed up. Analytical methods of volatile compounds and the application of lipidomics analysis in mechanisms of flavor formation of meat products are also reviewed.

Abiotic stress in plants is one of the main obstacles to global agricultural production and food security. Therefore, there is a need for the development of novel approaches to overcome these problems and achieve sustainability. Nanotechnology has emerged as one such novel approach to improve crop production, through the utilization of nanoscale products, such as nanofertilizer, nanofungicides, nanoherbicides and nanopesticides. Their ability to cross cellular barriers makes nanoparticles suitable for their application in agriculture. Since they are easily soluble, smaller, and effective for uptake by plants, nanoparticles are widely used as a modern agricultural tool. The implementation of nanoparticles has been found to be effective in improving the qualitative and quantitative aspects of crop production under various biotic and abiotic stress conditions.

However, the fate and effects of various nanoparticles on the soil, plants, and humans are not fully understood. Reports indicate that nanoparticles exhibit positive and negative impacts on biota due to their size, surface property, concentration within the system, and species or cell type under test. In plants, nanoparticles are translocated either by apoplast or symplast pathway or both. Also, it is not clear whether the nanoparticles entering the plant system remain as nanoparticles or are biotransformed into ionic forms or other organic compounds. Controversial results on the toxicity effects of nanomaterials on the plant system are available. In general, the nanomaterial toxicity was exerted by producing reactive oxygen species, leading to damage or denaturation of various biomolecules. The intensity of cyto- and geno-toxicity depends on the physical and chemical properties of nanoparticles. Based on the literature survey, it is observed that the effects of nanoparticles on the growth, photosynthesis, and primary and secondary metabolism of plants are both positive and negative; the response of these processes to the nanoparticle was associated with the type of nanoparticle, the concentration within the tissue, crop species, and stage of growth.

The increasing impacts of climate change and environmental stressors like drought, salinity, and heavy metal (HM) toxicity threaten crop productivity worldwide. Addressing these challenges demands the development of innovative technologies that can increase food production, reduce environmental impacts, and bolster the resilience of agroecosystems against climate variation. Nanotechnology, particularly the application of nanoparticles (NPs), represents an innovative approach to strengthen crop resilience and enhance the sustainability of agriculture. NPs have special physicochemical properties, including a high surface-area-to-volume ratio and the ability to penetrate plant tissues, which enhances nutrient uptake, stress resistance, and photosynthetic efficiency. This review paper explores how abiotic stressors impact crops and the role of NPs in bolstering crop resistance to these challenges. The main emphasis is on the potential of NPs potential to boost plant stress tolerance by triggering the plant defense mechanisms, improving growth under stress, and increasing agricultural yield. NPs have demonstrated potential in addressing key agricultural challenges, such as nutrient leaching, declining soil fertility, and reduced crop yield due to poor water management. However, applying NPs must consider regulatory and environmental concerns, including soil accumulation, toxicity to non-target organisms, and consumer perceptions of NP-enhanced products. To mitigate land and water impacts, NPs should be integrated with precision agriculture technologies, allowing targeted application of nano-fertilizers and nano-pesticides.

The method used is qualitative descriptive, data collection techniques are semi-structured interviews with purposive sampling and supported by passive participant observation and documentation. The results of the study indicate that farmer empowerment through a rice production increase program by the Food Security and Agriculture Service (DKPP) of Kubu Raya Regency is seen in 3 (three) dimensions, namely enabling, strengthening, and supporting. From these three dimensions, it was found that farmer empowerment through a rice production increase program by the DKPP was quite good, but still not optimal.

This study was conducted to investigate the effects of two different irrigation intervals (2 and 4 days) and four irrigation levels (150%, 125%, 100%, and 75% of evaporation from a Class-A pan) on the nutritional traits of three different paddy cultivars (Ronaldo, Baldo, and Osmanc\u0131k). Increasing irrigation intervals and decreasing irrigation levels reduced the nutritional properties (protein, oil, starch) of the rice grains. In addition, increasing irrigation levels also increased the phytic acid and dietary fiber contents. The highest protein (7.14%) and total starch (87.10%) contents were obtained from the 150% irrigation treatments. The highest amylose content (20.74%) was obtained from the 75% irrigation treatment.

To reduce the negative effects of environmental stress on crop plants, novel technologies, such as nanotechnology, have emerged. Implementing nanotechnology in modern agriculture can also help improve the efficiency of water usage, prevent plant diseases, ensure food security, reduce environmental pollution, and enhance sustainability. In this regard, nanoparticles (NPs) can help combat nutrient deficiencies, promote stress tolerance, and improve the yield and quality of crops. This can be achieved by stimulating the activity of certain enzymes, increasing the contents (e.g., chlorophyll) and efficiency of photosynthesis, and controlling plant pathogens. The use of nanoscale agrochemicals, including nanopesticides, nanoherbicides, and nanofertilizers, has recently acquired increasing interest as potential plant-enhancing technologies.

This study utilized a split-split-plot experimental design with three replications. The main plots were designated to different water regimes (100, 80, 60, and 40% of estimated evapotranspiration), while the sub-plots were randomly distributed with Zn and Fe nanoparticle concentrations (0, 100, and 200 mg/L). The sub-sub-plots were randomly allocated to three maize cultivars (SC-P3062, SC-32D99, and SC-P3433). The results revealed that exposure to drought conditions resulted in a significant decline in the yield and yield-related attributes across all maize cultivars examined. Grain yield decreased by 10\u201350% under drought conditions. However, the foliar application of Zn and Fe nanoparticles was found to significantly improve grain yield, protein content, oil content, starch content, crude fiber, ash, and macro- and micronutrient concentrations in the maize cultivars under control and drought stress conditions.

This narrative review evaluates the roles of these nutrients in human physiology and examines whether their absence in plant-based diets is likely to impact health outcomes. Retinol requirements can be met through the consumption of provitamin A carotenoids in plant foods, even in individuals with reduced conversion efficiency.

In 2006, the EU banned the use of antibiotics and other chemicals in order to reduce chemical residues in food consumed by humans. It is well known that oxidative stress and inflammatory processes must be combated to achieve higher productivity. The adverse effects of the use of pharmaceuticals and other synthetic compounds on animal health and product quality and safety have increased interest in phytocompounds. With the use of plant polyphenols in animal nutrition, they are gaining more attention as a supplement to animal feed. Livestock feeding based on a sustainable, environmentally friendly approach (clean, safe, and green agriculture) would also be a win\u2013win for farmers and society. There is an increasing interest in producing healthier products of animal origin with a higher ratio of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) to saturated fatty acids by modulating animal nutrition. Secondary plant metabolites (polyphenols) are essential chemical compounds for plant physiology as they are involved in various functions such as growth, pigmentation, and resistance to pathogenic organisms. Polyphenols are exogenous antioxidants that act as one of the first lines of cell defense. Therefore, the discoveries on the intracellular antioxidant activity of polyphenols as a plant supplement have contributed significantly to the improvement of antioxidant activity, as polyphenols prevent oxidative stress damage and eliminate excessively produced free radicals.

Resveratrol, a stilbene derivative showcasing typical polyphenolic traits, is particularly noteworthy. Despite abundant bioavailability data from in\u00a0vitro and animal studies, applying these findings to humans demands nuanced consideration. The objective of this article is to conduct a meta-analysis on clinical trial data, systematically assessing the oral bioavailability of resveratrol and deriving meaningful insights into its efficacy in humans. To achieve this goal, we thoroughly examined publications across five major global databases: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Embase, and Science Direct. The study exclusively included clinical trials involving healthy adults, where pharmacokinetic parameters were measured following the oral administration of at least one dose of resveratrol as a single preparation. For the meta-analysis data extraction, the mean score and standard deviation (SD) were included. Heterogeneity, degree of inconsistency between studies, and meta-regression were assessed. From these searches, we scrutinized data from 84 oral administrations encompassing nine resveratrol doses ranging from 25 to 5000\u2009mg. Our findings indicate a linear increase in the amount of free resveratrol entering the bloodstream with the administered dose, while Tmax values remain unaffected. The mean maximum plasma concentration of resveratrol (31.07\u2009ng/mL) closely mirrors the mean Cmax observed in the group administered a medium resveratrol dose ranging from 100 to 500\u2009mg (33.59\u2009ng/mL). This similarity implies the appropriateness of employing these specific doses of resveratrol, taking into consideration both its bioavailability and very low risk of potential side effects.

Flavonoids, a diverse class of bioactive polyphenolic compounds found in plant-derived foods and beverages, have garnered increasing attention as potential therapeutic agents for improving metabolic health. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the therapeutic effects of flavonoids in the context of the MetS, with a particular focus on their modulation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway. AMPK serves as a central regulator of cellular energy balance, glucose metabolism, and lipid homeostasis, making it a critical target for metabolic intervention. Through a systematic review of the literature up to April 2024, preclinical studies across various flavonoid subclasses, including flavonols, and flavan-3-ols, were analysed to elucidate their mechanistic roles in metabolic regulation. Many studies suggests that flavonoids enhance glycolipid metabolism by facilitating glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) translocation and activating the AMPK pathway, thereby improving glycemic control in diabetes models. In obesity-related studies, flavonoids demonstrated significant inhibitory effects on lipid synthesis, reduced adipogenesis, and attenuated proinflammatory cytokine secretion via AMPK activation. These findings show the broad therapeutic potential of flavonoids in addressing the MetS and its associated disorders. While these preclinical insights highlight flavonoids as promising natural agents for metabolic health improvement, it is important to note that their excessive concentrations may disrupt these pathways, potentially leading to metabolic imbalance and cytotoxicity. Further studies and clinical trials are essential to determine optimal dosing regimens, formulations, and the long-term safety and efficacy of flavonoids.

The advances in precision agriculture over the past few years have substantially enhanced the efficiency of applying spatially variable agronomic inputs for irrigation, such as fertilizers, pesticides, seeds, and water, and we can attribute them to the increasing number of innovations that utilize new technologies that are capable of monitoring field crops for varying spatial and temporal changes. Remote sensing technology is the primary driver of success in precision agriculture, along with other technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), robotic systems, weather forecasting technology, and global positioning systems (GPSs).

To address food security, the Malaysian government targets a 70% self-sufficiency level (SSL) in rice production, requiring precise spatiotemporal information on rice cultivation. Remote sensing has been widely used to map rice extent in Malaysia, particularly in granary areas (facilitated by irrigation system), the main production zones. However, studies on non-granary areas (without irrigation systems) remain limited. This study addresses this gap by employing the Phenology-Expert Based Unsupervised Classification Method (PEB-UC) with Sentinel-2 time series data on the Google Earth Engine platform to map rice extent and cropping patterns at the sub-district level across Terengganu State, Malaysia, covering both granary and non-granary areas.

The excessive use of such fertilizers leaves residue on agricultural products, pollutes the environment, upsets agrarian ecosystems, and lowers soil quality. Furthermore, a significant proportion of the nutrient content, including nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, is lost from the soil (50\u201370%) before being utilized. Nanofertilizers, on the other hand, use nanoparticles to control the release of nutrients, making them more efficient and cost-effective than traditional fertilizers. Nanofertilizers comprise one or more plant nutrients within nanoparticles where at least 50% of the particles are smaller than 100 nanometers. Carbon nanotubes, graphene, and quantum dots are some examples of the types of nanomaterials used in the production of nanofertilizers. Nanofertilizers are a new generation of fertilizers that utilize advanced nanotechnology to provide an efficient and sustainable method of fertilizing crops. They are designed to deliver plant nutrients in a controlled manner, ensuring that the nutrients are gradually released over an extended period, thus providing a steady supply of essential elements to the plants. The controlled-release system is more efficient than traditional fertilizers, as it reduces the need for frequent application and the amount of fertilizer. These nanomaterials have a high surface area-to-volume ratio, making them ideal for holding and releasing nutrients. Naturally occurring nanoparticles are found in various sources, including volcanic ash, ocean, and biological matter such as viruses and dust. However, regarding large-scale production, relying solely on naturally occurring nanoparticles may not be sufficient or practical. In agriculture, nanotechnology has been primarily used to increase crop production while minimizing losses and activating plant defense mechanisms against pests, insects, and other environmental challenges. Furthermore, nanofertilizers can reduce runoff and nutrient leaching into the environment, improving environmental sustainability. They can also improve fertilizer use efficiency, leading to higher crop yields and reducing the overall cost of fertilizer application. Nanofertilizers are especially beneficial in areas where traditional fertilizers are inefficient or ineffective. Nanofertilizers can provide a more efficient and cost-effective way to fertilize crops while reducing the environmental impact of fertilizer application. They are the product of promising new technology that can help to meet the increasing demand for food and improve agricultural sustainability.

The overuse and inappropriate application of nitrogen fertilizers have resulted in environmental pollution, in addition to subjecting both humans and livestock to negative health hazards. Finding a viable substitute for traditional nitrogen fertilizers is crucial and essential to help improve crop yield and minimize environmental damage. Nano-nitrogen fertilizers offer a possible alternative to traditional fertilizers due to a slow/controlled release of nitrogen. The present work aimed to study the effect of a slow-release urea nanofertilizer on soil ammonical (NH4-N) and nitrate-N (NO3-N) content, culturable soil microflora, and soil enzyme activities in three different soil samples procured from Ludhiana and Patiala districts through a soil column study. Seven treatments, including 0, 50 (75 kg/ha N), 75 (112.5 kg/ha N), and 100% (150 kg/ha N) of the recommended dose (RD) of conventional urea and nano-urea fertilizer were applied. The leachate samples collected from nano-urea treatment exhibited NH4-N for the first two weeks, followed by NO3-N appearance. The higher NH4-N and NO3-N contents in the leachate were recorded for light-textured soil as compared to medium- and heavy-textured soil samples. The soil microbial counts and enzyme activities were recorded to be maximum in light-textured soils. Therefore, this slow-release formulation could be more useful for light-textured soils to decrease applied N-fertilizer losses, as well as for improving the soil microbial viable cell counts and soil enzyme activities. The effect of urea nanofertilizer on the growth and yield of direct-seeded rice (Oryza sativa L.) was also evaluated under field conditions. Both studies were performed independently. Numerically, the highest shoot height, fresh and dry shoot weight, and significantly maximum total chlorophyll, carotenoid, and anthocyanins were recorded in the T2 (100% RDF through nano-urea) treatment. The yield-attributing traits, including the number of filled grains and thousand-grain weight, were also recorded to have increased in T2 treatment. A numerical increase in NPK for plant and grain of rice at 100% RDN through nano-urea was recorded. The soil application of the product exhibited no negative effect on the soil microbial viable cell count on different doses of nano-urea fertilizer. The soil nitrogen fixer viable counts were rather improved in nano-urea treatments.

With the increased popularity of plant-based proteins in recent years, incorporation of proteins into starch-based products is more commonplace. These formulation changes may have unforeseen effects on ingredient functionality and sensory outcomes of starch-containing products during storage, which makes the investigation of protein-starch interactions and subsequent impact on starch retrogradation and product quality essential. Protein can inhibit or promote starch retrogradation based on its exposed residues. Charged residues promote charge-dipole interactions between starch-bound phosphate and protein, hydrophobic groups restrict amylose release and reassociation, while hydrophilic groups impact water/molecular mobility. Covalent bonds (disulfide linkages) formed between proteins may enhance starch retrogradation, while glycosidic bonds formed between starch and protein during high-temperature processing may limit starch retrogradation. With these protein-starch interactions in mind, products can be formulated with proteins that enhance or delay textural changes in starch-containing products.

However, limited research has been conducted on the synergistic effects of OF combined with inorganic N fertilizer, particularly PCU, on rice yield, quality, and profit. To address this issue, a two-year field experiment was conducted involving five fertilization treatments: no nitrogen fertilizer (0N), urea applied at the full local rate of 270 kg N ha\u22121 (CK), PCU at a reduced rate of 240 kg N ha\u22121 (T1), a combination of 70% PCU and 30% urea at 240 kg N ha\u22121 (T2), and T2 supplemented with 4500 kg ha\u22121 of OF (T3). The results showed that, compared with CK, the T1 treatment improved the appearance quality and taste value but slightly reduced the other quality indices. In contrast, the T2 and T3 treatments enhanced the grain yield, especially for T3, with an advantage in the tiller number, shoot dry weight, and leaf area index, which promoted the panicle number, filled grain, and grain weight, thereby significantly increasing the yield. The T2 improved the processing, appearance, and taste qualities by reducing the protein content, increasing the amylose content and gel consistency, and optimizing the starch viscosity characteristics (increasing the peak viscosity and breakdown while reducing the setback and consistency), with the addition of OF (T3) further expanding the benefits. Furthermore, the nutritional quality was also enhanced by optimizing the protein components and increasing the protein yield. Although the agricultural inputs in the T2 and T3 treatments were higher, the profit from the increased grain yield could cover these inputs, thereby maintaining profit with T3 or increasing profit with T2.

Currently, little is understood about the correlation between biomass productivity and carotenoid content, which is a fundamental parameter for facilitating the immediate expansion of microalgae bioprocesses and ensuring the availability and industrial viability of these compounds. In this context, this study aims to investigate the carotenoid profile of Chlorella vulgaris through growth curve experiments conducted under photoautotrophic and heterotrophic regimes. Additionally, a trade-off analysis was performed for the production of carotenoids from microalgae. Carotenoids were quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with diode array and mass spectrometry detectors (HPLC-PDA-MS/MS). The performance of kinetic phases and energy demands across growth regimes was assessed to provide insights into production trade-offs. The results indicated that a total of 22 different carotenoids were identified in all the extracts. The all-trans-lutein and all-trans-\u03b2-carotene were the majority compounds. The total carotenoid content of Chlorella vulgaris revealed significant differences in the kinetic phases of carotenoid production, indicating that carotenoid volumetric production is only viable if the cultures are conducted until the log and stationary phases, based on the function of the biomass volumetric production (weight.volume\u22121). Therefore, the best trade-off for the process was to provide photoautotrophic growth until the exponential phase (log). Under this condition, the maximum carotenoid and lutein content was 2921.70 \u00b5g.L\u22121, reaching a maximum cell biomass of 1.46 g.L\u22121. From an environmental/economic point of view, the energy demand was 7.74 kWh.L\u22121.

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of PCs extracted from Arthrospira platensis BUUC1503 on the color enhancement of P. clarkii crayfish when added to food pellets. Materials and Methods: The following five dietary treatments were prepared: a control (without PC) and four experimental diets with PC supplementation at concentrations of 10, 50, 100, and 500 mg/kg. The stability of the pellets in water was ensured for 180 min. P. clarkii crayfish were fed these diets at 5% of their body weight daily for 10 weeks. Body weight and total length were measured. Color changes in P. clarkii were also assessed. After the experiments, we treated the samples according to Animal Welfare Technical Information No.16.8 Correct euthanasia of decapods. Results: Although PC supplementation did not significantly affect the yellowness (b* value) of P. clarkii, it significantly enhanced the redness (a* value) and lightness (L* value) pigmentation compared with the control. At week 10, crayfish fed a diet containing 100 mg/kg PC exhibited the highest L* value (36.51 \u00b1 1.59) (p < 0.001).

This review focuses on the immunomodulatory effects of polyphenols in breast cancer, emphasizing their capacity to influence the reaction of adaptive and innate immune cells within the tumor-associated environment. Polyphenols are implicated in the modulation of inflammation, the enhancement of antioxidant defenses, the promotion of epigenetic modifications, and the support of immune functions.

Satellite-driven crop monitoring has become a main method to derive crop information at local, regional, and global scales by revealing the spatial and temporal dimensions of crop growth status and production. However, there is a lack of quantitative, objective, and robust methods to ensure the reliability of crop information, which reduces the applicability of crop monitoring and leads to uncertain and undesirable consequences. In this paper, we review recent progress in crop monitoring and identify the challenges and opportunities in future efforts. We find that satellite-derived metrics do not fully capture determinants of crop production and do not quantitatively interpret crop growth status; the latter can be advanced by integrating effective satellite-derived metrics and new onboard sensors. We have identified that ground data accessibility and the negative effects of knowledge-based analyses are two essential issues in crop monitoring that reduce the applicability of crop monitoring for decisions on food security. Crowdsourcing is one solution to overcome the restrictions of ground-truth data accessibility. We argue that user participation in the complete process of crop monitoring could improve the reliability of crop information. Encouraging users to obtain crop information from multiple sources could prevent unconscious biases.

Current accuracy assessments of remote sensing-based cropland products focused on the consistency of spatial patterns for specific years, yet the reliability of these cropland products in time-series analysis remains unclear. Using cropland area data from the second and third national land surveys of China (referred to as NLSCD) as a benchmark, we evaluate the area-based and spatial-based consistency of cropland changes in five 30 m time-series land cover products covering 2010 and 2020, including the annual cropland dataset of China (CACD), the annual China Land Cover Dataset (CLCD), China\u2019s Land-use/cover dataset (CLUD), the Global Land-Cover product with Fine Classification System (GLC_FCS30), and GlobeLand30. We also employed the GeoDetector model to explore the relationships between the consistency in cropland change and the environmental factors (e.g., cropland fragmentation, topographic features, frequency of cloud cover, and management practices). The area-based consistency analysis showed that all five cropland products indicate a declining trend in cropland areas in China over the past decade, while the amount of cropland loss ranges from 5.59% to 57.85% of that reported by the NLSCD. At the prefecture-level city scale, the correlation coefficients between the cropland area changes detected by five cropland products and the NLSCD are low, with GlobeLand30 having the highest coefficient at 0.67. The proportion of prefecture-level cities where the change direction of cropland area in each cropland product is inconsistent with the NLSCD ranges from 13.27% to 39.23%, with CLCD showing the highest proportion and CLUD the lowest. At the pixel scale, the spatial-based consistency analysis reveals that 79.51% of cropland expansion pixels and 77.79% of cropland loss pixels are completely inconsistent across five cropland products, with the southern part of China exhibiting greater inconsistency compared to Northwest China. Besides, the frequency of cloud cover and management practices (e.g., irrigation) are the primary environmental factors influencing consistency in cropland expansion and loss, respectively.

Dietary fiber (DF), especially viscous DF, can contribute to a reduction in the glycemic response resulting from the consumption of carbohydrate-rich foods. Target and control of postprandial glycemic values are critical for diabetes prevention and management. Some mechanisms have been described for soluble DF action, from the increase in chyme viscosity to the production of short-chain fatty acids resulting from fermentation, which stimulates gastrointestinal motility and the release of GLP-1 and PYY hormones. The postprandial glycemic response due to inulin and resistant starch ingestion is well established. However, other soluble dietary fibers (SDF) can also contribute to glycemic control, such as gums, \u03b2-glucan, psyllium, arabinoxylan, soluble corn fiber, resistant maltodextrin, glucomannan, and edible fungi, which can be added alone or together in different products, such as bread, beverages, soups, biscuits, and others.

Glucomannan, derived from konjac and porang tubers, has gained attention for its diverse health-promoting properties. However, its application in beverages is limited due to its high viscosity. Combining glucomannan with isomaltooligosaccharide (IMO) is suggested to synergistically enhance functionality, particularly improving gastrointestinal health. This study investigates the functional effects of porang glucomannan and isomaltooligosaccharide-containing fiber drinks (GIFD) on body weight, feed intake, digesta profiles (digesta weight, moisture content, pH) and gut microbiota using in vivo method. Twenty-four male Sprague Dawley rats were divided into 4 groups, including control, inulin, and 2 doses of glucomannan and isomaltooligosaccharide fiber drink (GIFD). Rats were fed with AIN-93M. Adaptation was carried out for 5 days followed by 28 days of intervention. Results indicate that GIFD consumption led to reduced feed intake, likely due to increased satiety effects and glucomannan\u2019s gel-forming ability, resulting in lower body weight gain compared to other groups. While GIFD did not significantly alter digesta weight and moisture contents, it significantly decreased pH values. Analysis of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) showed a shift in propionic acid levels, suggesting a beneficial effect on weight control. Moreover, GIFD treatment reduced abundance percentages of enteric bacteria like E. coli and Clostridium, possibly due to increased SCFA production. However, GIFD consumption did not significantly alter sIgA concentration, although there was a trend towards increased levels in GIFD-2, suggesting potential immunomodulatory effects. Overall, it was indicated that porang glucomannan and IMO-containing fiber drinks has the potential to be used as beverages to support body weight regulation and to help maintaining digestive tract health.\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\nGlucomannan and isomaltooligosaccharide-containing fiber drinks (GIFD) reduced feed intake.\nConsumption of GIFD induced the shift of molar proportion of SCFAs suggesting beneficial health effect.\nGIFD treated groups showed lower abundance percentages of coli and Clostridium compared to control.\nGIFD is potential to be developed as weight management product.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-11-20", "synthetic_support_claim": "GIFD consumption led to reduced feed intake due to increased satiety effects and glucomannan\u2019s gel-forming ability.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Glucomannan-IMO drinks significantly enhance sIgA concentrations, offering strong immunomodulatory effects for consumers."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "3a3cf9d6adbe4a7d8049db446d2aaed19560b2fd", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3a3cf9d6adbe4a7d8049db446d2aaed19560b2fd", "title": "Polysaccharides: The Sweet and Bitter Impacts on Cardiovascular Risk", "abstract": "Cardiovascular risk is a clinical factor that represents the probability of developing cardiovascular diseases (CVDs).

They include starches, non-starch polysaccharides, and prebiotic fibers, categorized further into soluble and insoluble fibers. Soluble fibers, found in oats, legumes, and fruits, dissolve in water, forming gels that help lower serum cholesterol and modulate blood glucose levels. Insoluble fibers, present in whole grains and vegetables, aid in bowel regularity. The cardiovascular benefits of polysaccharides are linked to their ability to bind bile acids, reducing cholesterol levels, and the production of short-chain fatty acids by gut microbiota, which have anti-inflammatory properties.

Particular emphasis was placed on details related to the changes occurring in vitamin C, polyphenols, flavonoids, glycosides and volatile compounds, as well as the antioxidant activity. An analysis of the degradation mechanisms of these compounds showed that vitamin C, phenols, flavonoids and glycosides react with oxygen during the convective drying process under high drying temperatures, and the reaction rate results in degradation in such bioactive compounds due to high reducibility. On the other hand, high temperature results in a short drying time, thus minimizing the degradation of bioactive compounds. The reviewed research works addressing this trend revealed that the ideal drying temperatures for retaining vitamin C, polyphenols, flavonoids, glycosides, volatile compounds and their antioxidant activity were 50\u201360 \u00b0C, 55\u201360 \u00b0C, 60\u201370 \u00b0C, 45\u201350 \u00b0C, 40\u201350 \u00b0C and 50\u201370 \u00b0C, respectively.

Both R85 and R105 had higher catechins than R65 and R125. The LWV volatilome consisted of esters (19.89%), terpenoids (18.95%), ketones (11.3%), heterocyclic compounds (9.99%), and alcohols (8.59%). In general, acids, aldehydes, amines, aromatics, ethers, hydrocarbons, phenols, sulfur compounds, and terpenoids accumulated in higher amounts in R85 and R105. The highly accumulated compounds in R105 were associated with green, fruity, sweet, woody, floral, hawthorn, mild, nutty, powdery, rose, and rosy flavors. The main pathways affected are secondary metabolites, sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis, glycerolipid metabolism, zeatin biosynthesis, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, ABC transport, glutathione metabolism, etc. Therefore, R105 can be used to achieve the optimal taste, flavor, and aroma of LWV.

In this study, TaGASR1 (gibberellic acid-stimulated regulator 1), a potential candidate for heat stress resistance, was isolated, and its expression was found to be significantly greater in HD3086 wheat than in HD2894 wheat at both the seedling and anthesis stages after exposure to 42 \u00b0C heat stress (HS). Furthermore, in silico studies validated the molecular findings, revealing a CDS region of 297 nucleotides with 2 ORFs, with ~93% sequence similarity to the TaGASR1 gene from the TAM107 wheat variety. A 3D model of the target protein was designed using the C8C4P9.1 template, showing 95.92% sequence similarity and 100% query coverage with the gibberellin-stimulated transcript. Furthermore, studies of the conserved motifs and protein-protein interactions of the TaGASR1 protein have identified three major functional partners: cold acclimation proteins, ABA-inducible proteins, and protein phosphatase 2C, emphasizing its role in abiotic stress responses.

Therefore, the goal of this experiment was to synthesize a novel SRU fertilizer using \u201ceco-friendly materials\u201d and the \u201cscrew press method\u201d. In order to achieve this goal, urea (U) was innovatively and highly intercalated between interlayers of impure montmorillonite (Mt) (bentonite) with the help of polyphenol-rich pomegranate peel powder (PPP) by a single-screw oil press machine. The experiment had five treatments, including a fixed ratio of U/Mt (4:1) with variable ratios of U/Mt/PPP (w/w), including 4:1:0 (F1), 4:1:1 (F2), 4:1:1.5 (F3), and 4:1:2 (F4). Control (U) and F5 treatments (U/PPP at ratio of 4:1) were also included. These composites were fabricated using a single-screw oil press machine. The produced composites were characterized using FTIR, SEM, XRD, and TG analyses. The release pattern was studied using the White method. The XRD (low-angle) results revealed that the interlayer space of Mt increased from 12.3 \u00c5 in bentonite to 19.4 \u00c5, 27.3 \u00c5, 25.7 \u00c5, and 0 \u00c5 in the F1, F2, F3, and F4 composites, respectively, which is an indicator of the high intercalation of U between the interlayers of Mt, especially in the F2 treatment. The XRD (low- and normal-angle) analyses indicated that the two main reasons for the high intercalation in the F2 treatment were, first, the complete conversion of urea from a crystalline to an amorphous state by PPP and, second, the increase in the interlayer space of Mt nano-sheets by PPP. It seems that PPP at a low concentration (F2) can have a positive effect on the placement of U in the interlayer space, but at high concentrations (F4), due to intensive pectin gelation, the space between the Mt layers grows until complete exfoliation. FTIR spectra and TG analysis also confirmed this hypothesis. SEM images revealed the formation of an intensive crosslink between U, Mt, and PPP. A release test in water revealed that only 10% of U in the F2 treatment was released after 10 h, and 87% after 120 h, which indicates the satisfactory slow-release pattern of this composite. By comparing the results of the present study with the other SRUs reported in the literature, it can be concluded that the composite F2, in addition to offering valuable polyphenol-rich plant materials, had an acceptable performance in the aspect of the U release pattern.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-11-21", "synthetic_support_claim": "The screw press method can synthesize effective slow-release urea fertilizer using polyphenol-rich pomegranate peel powder.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "This SRU fertilizer improves crop yields more effectively than conventional fertilizers."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "8e804b68d3fd7495d7b0598e165d2c3b16d7ed72", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8e804b68d3fd7495d7b0598e165d2c3b16d7ed72", "title": "Advances in bio-polymer coatings for probiotic microencapsulation: chitosan and beyond for enhanced stability and controlled release", "abstract": "ABSTRACT This review paper analyzes recent advancements in bio-polymer coatings for probiotic microencapsulation, with a particular emphasis on chitosan and its synergistic combinations with other materials.

This narrative review highlights the growing interest in the use of mushrooms as functional ingredients in fermented beverages, emphasizing their technological and functional advantages. Fermentation significantly enhances the nutritional content and bioavailability of mushrooms, making it an ideal method to maximize the health benefits and sensory appeal of mushroom-based beverages. Microbial activity breaks down complex compounds in mushrooms, making their bioactive components more accessible for absorption; bringing unique flavors, aromas, and textures; and creating a rich-sensory experience while offering potential health benefits. Mushrooms can also improve the stability and shelf life of fermented beverages due to the presence of antimicrobial and antioxidant compounds, adding another valuable benefit to their use in functional beverages.

The pressure to feed nearly 8 billion people while maintaining a minimal impact on the environment has prompted a movement toward new, more sustainable food sources. For thousands of years, both the macro (seaweed and kelp) and micro (unicellular) forms of algae have been cultivated as a food source. Algae have evolved to be highly efficient at resource utilization and have proven to be a viable source of nutritious biomass that could address many of the current food production issues. Particularly for microalgae, studies of their large-scale growth and cultivation come from the biofuel industry; however, this knowledge can be reasonably translated into the production of algae-based food products. The ability of algae to sequester CO2 lends to its sustainability by helping to reduce the carbon footprint of its production. Additionally, algae can be produced on non-arable land using non-potable water (including brackish or seawater), which allows them to complement rather than compete with traditional agriculture. Algae inherently have the desired qualities of a sustainable food source because they produce highly digestible proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates, and are rich in essential fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals. Although algae have yet to be fully domesticated as food sources, a variety of cultivation and breeding tools exist that can be built upon to allow for the increased productivity and enhanced nutritional and organoleptic qualities that will be required to bring algae to mainstream utilization.

Pseudomonas spp. fix the amount of atmospheric nitrogen, solubilize phosphorus and potassium, and also produce phytohormones, lytic enzymes, volatile organic compounds, antibiotics, and secondary metabolites during stress conditions. These compounds stimulate plant growth by inducing systemic resistance and by inhibiting the growth of pathogens.

These payments are motivated by environmental benefits, including improved soil health, reduced erosion, and increased soil organic carbon. However, previous work based on experimental plots or crop modeling indicates cover crops may reduce crop yields. It remains unclear, though, how recent cover crop adoption has affected productivity in commercial agricultural systems. Here we perform the first large\u2010scale, field\u2010level analysis of observed yield impacts from cover cropping as implemented across the US Corn Belt. We use validated satellite data products at sub\u2010field scales to analyze maize and soybean yield outcomes for over 90,000 fields in 2019\u20132020. Because we lack data on cover crop species or timing, we seek to quantify the yield impacts of cover cropping as currently practiced in aggregate. Using causal forests analysis, we estimate an average maize yield loss of 5.5% on fields where cover crops were used for 3 or more years, compared with fields that did not adopt cover cropping. Maize yield losses were larger on fields with better soil ratings, cooler mid\u2010season temperatures, and lower spring rainfall. For soybeans, average yield losses were 3.5%, with larger impacts on fields with warmer June temperatures, lower spring and late\u2010season rainfall, and, to a lesser extent, better soils. Estimated impacts are consistent with multiple mechanisms indicated by experimental and simulation\u2010based studies, including the effects of cover crops on nitrogen dynamics, water consumption, and soil oxygen depletion.

Previous studies indicate that one of the benefits of cover crop use is the increase in the activity of enzymes in the soil. Some enzymes are also responsible for breaking down herbicide molecules. The biodegradation of herbicides in the soil is a natural process that leads to a reduction in the concentration of the parent compound overtime. Although cover crop use can result in the increased activity of soil enzymes, to date, there is no evidence that such increased activity also leads to a reduced persistence of residual herbicides in the soil. However, cover crop use does alter the fate of residual herbicides by interception, with some studies reporting more than 90% interception. Without rainfall or irrigation during the days following its application, the herbicide remains on the plant surface and is ineffective as a weed control tool. Following the integrated weed management approach, the combination of cover crop and soil residual herbicides is a promising alternative to delay the development of new herbicide resistance cases. However, more research is needed to understand the impact of biomass accumulation on residual herbicide fate and to determine the best strategies to improve herbicide placement on cover cropping system.

The production of crops affects the economy of a country to a great extent. In agriculture, observing the soil, weather, and water availability and, based on these factors, selecting an appropriate crop, finding the availability of seeds, analysing crop demand in the market, and having knowledge of crop cultivation are important. At present, many advancements have been made in recent times, starting from crop selection to crop cutting. Mainly, the roles of the Internet of Things, cloud computing, and machine learning tools help a farmer to analyse and make better decisions in each stage of cultivation. Once suitable crop seeds are chosen, the farmer shall proceed with seeding, monitoring crop growth, disease detection, finding the ripening stage of the crop, and then crop cutting. The main objective is to provide a continuous support system to a farmer so that he can obtain regular inputs about his field and crop. Additionally, he should be able to make proper decisions at each stage of farming. Artificial intelligence, machine learning, the cloud, sensors, and other automated devices shall be included in the decision support system so that it will provide the right information within a short time span. By using the support system, a farmer will be able to take decisive measures without fully depending on the local agriculture offices. We have proposed an IoT-enabled soil nutrient classification and crop recommendation (IoTSNA-CR) model to recommend crops. The model helps to minimise the use of fertilisers in soil so as to maximise productivity. The proposed model consists of phases, such as data collection using IoT sensors from cultivation lands, storing this real-time data into cloud memory services, accessing this cloud data using an Android application, and then pre-processing and periodic analysis of it using different learning techniques. A sensory system was prepared with optimised cost that contains different sensors, such as a soil temperature sensor, a soil moisture sensor, a water level indicator, a pH sensor, a GPS sensor, and a colour sensor, along with an Arduino UNO board. This sensory system allowed us to collect moisture, temperature, water level, soil NPK colour values, date, time, longitude, and latitude. The studies have revealed that the Agrinex NPK soil testing tablets should be applied to a soil sample, and then the soil colour can be sensed using an LDR colour sensor to predict the phosphorus (P), nitrogen (N), and potassium (K) values. These collected data together were stored in Firebase cloud storage media. Then, an Android application was developed to fetch and analyse the data from the Firebase cloud service from time to time by a farmer. In this study, a novel approach was identified via the hybridisation of algorithms. We have developed an algorithm using a multi-class support vector machine with a directed acyclic graph and optimised it using the fruit fly optimisation method (MSVM-DAG-FFO). The highest accuracy rate of this algorithm is 0.973, compared to 0.932 for SVM, 0.922 for SVM kernel, and 0.914 for decision tree. It has been observed that the overall performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of accuracy, recall, precision, and F-Score is high compared to other methods. The IoTSNA-CR device allows the farmer to maintain his field soil information easily in the cloud service using his own mobile with minimum knowledge. Additionally, it reduces the expenditure to balance the soil minerals and increases productivity.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-03-12", "synthetic_support_claim": "A novel MSVM-DAG-FFO algorithm achieves the highest accuracy rate of 0.973 for soil nutrient classification.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "IoT-enabled systems negatively impact soil biodiversity and long-term soil health."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "c57797565b638db2d6a0eb43cfde5797eb1f4d95", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c57797565b638db2d6a0eb43cfde5797eb1f4d95", "title": "AgriFusion: A Low-Carbon Sustainable Computing Approach for Precision Agriculture Through Probabilistic Ensemble Crop Recommendation", "abstract": "Optimizing crop production is essential for sustainable agriculture and food security.

The classification task is performed by a machine-learning model which was trained on the colorimetric pH indicators deployed on the paper sensor. By mapping topsoil pH on a test site with an area of 9 hectares, the mobile system was benchmarked in the field against standard soil lab analysis. The mobile system has correctly classified soil pH in 97% of test cases, while reducing the analysis turnaround time from days (soil lab) to minutes (mobile). By performing on-the-spot analyses using the mobile system in the field, a 9-fold increase of spatial resolution reveals pH-variations not detectable in the standard compound mapping mode of lab analysis.

Understanding the genetics of hybrid performance under drought stress is crucial for designing breeding strategies to develop high-yielding hybrids. This study aimed to (i) evaluate the performance of three-way cross hybrids developed from elite inbred lines, including several drought-tolerant lines, using a line-by-tester mating design, and (ii) estimate the general combining ability (GCA) and specific combining ability (SCA) effects of the tropical maize inbred lines under managed drought and optimum conditions.

Significant (p < 0.001) variations were observed among genotypes and genotypes-by-environment interactions (GEIs) for grain yield and other traits. There was a preponderance of GCA variance (lines and tester) over SCA variance, indicating that additive effects were more important in determining grain yield and other key traits under both managed drought and optimum conditions.

In recent times, the trend has shifted towards developing and utilizing bioproducts that are eco-friendly and sustainable to use in agriculture. They enhance productivity and restore equilibrium naturally in agroecological systems. In this regard, plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) facilitate crop production in multiple ways. This review deals with the limitations and challenges of conventional pesticides following the different microbes used as bioproducts along with how Bacillus is one of the promising PGPR used in sustainable agriculture. Bacillus spp. improves crop growth in both direct and indirect ways through nitrogen fixation, P and K solubilization, phytohormones production, quorum quenching, biofilm formation, and lytic enzymes production. Moreover, Bacillus spp. boost plant resistance towards the notorious phytopathogens. As Bacillus spp. is eco-friendly, promotes plant growth, confers resistance against diseases, improves soil fertility, non-toxic, naturally occurring microbe, and supports sustainable agriculture, there is a need to explore the potential of native Bacillus spp. and to use them in bioproduct development to support sustainable agriculture.

The major goal of sustainable agriculture is to ameliorate productivity and reduce pests and disease prevalence to such a degree that prevents large-scale damage to crops. Agriculture is a composite interrelation among plants, microbes, and soil. Plant microbes play a major role in growth promotion and improve soil fertility as well. Bacillus spp. produces an extensive range of bio-chemicals that assist in plant disease control, promote plant development, and make them suitable for agricultural uses. Bacillus spp. support plant growth by N fixation, P and K solubilization, and phytohormone synthesis, in addition to being the most propitious biocontrol agent. Moreover, Bacilli excrete extracellular metabolites, including antibiotics, lytic enzymes, and siderophores, and demonstrate antagonistic activity against phytopathogens. Bacillus spp. boosts plant resistance toward pathogens by inducing systemic resistance (ISR). The most effective microbial insecticide against insects and pests in agriculture is Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). Additionally, the incorporation of toxin genes in genetically modified crops increases resistance to insects and pests. There is a constant increase in the identified Bacillus species as potential biocontrol agents. Moreover, they have been involved in the biosynthesis of metallic nanoparticles. The main objective of this review article is to display the uses and application of Bacillus specie as a promising biopesticide in sustainable agriculture. Bacillus spp. strains that are antagonistic and promote plant yield attributes could be valuable in developing novel formulations to lead the way toward sustainable agriculture.", "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-12-01", "synthetic_support_claim": "Bacillus spp. improves crop growth directly and indirectly through nitrogen fixation and phytohormones production.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Bacillus spp. entirely replace the need for synthetic pesticides and fertilizers in modern agriculture."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "26326eb5b9d4a6092bf70ea4c15ee8a366ef1171", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/26326eb5b9d4a6092bf70ea4c15ee8a366ef1171", "title": "Identification and genomic insights into Bacillus siamensis strains with host colonization potential and activity against tomato bacterial wilt.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nBacterial wilt (BW), caused by Ralstonia solanacearum species complex (RSSC), is considered as one of the most destructive plant diseases worldwide. In this study, two strains of Bacillus siamensis, BB605-1 and BB653, were screened and identified from endophytes in healthy tomato and mangrove plants, respectively.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBoth strains demonstrated antagonistic activities against all 16 RSSC strains, representing eight sequevars from various hosts. The growth of RSSC was suppressed by the crude antimicrobial extracts produced by two strains. The pot inoculation experiment revealed the control efficiencies of two strains against tomato bacterial wilt as 59.63% and 63.98%, respectively. After imparting rifampicin resistance to the strains and applying them to tomato plants, both strains successfully established stable colonization in the rhizosphere, roots, stems, and leaves of tomato plants. Additionally, our study demonstrated that both strains exhibited significant plant growth-promoting properties. Complete genome sequencing revealed genome size of 3.868\u2009M\u2009bp with 3594 protein-coding genes for BB605-1, and 3.857\u2009M\u2009bp with 3600 protein-coding genes for BB653. Genome analysis of both strains identified seven secondary metabolite clusters with known antimicrobial properties and predicted three unknown compounds with potentially novel properties. Genome mining revealed several key genes associated with plant growth regulation, colonization, and biofilm formation, and we also detected these corresponding substances.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese findings provide a compelling case for the application of B. siamensis in agricultural practices. The isolates' multiple capacities to colonize, enhance plant growth, and exert antagonistic effects against BW positions them as highly promising candidates for an integrated biological solution. \u00a9 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-11-25", "synthetic_support_claim": "Both strains of Bacillus siamensis effectively suppress Ralstonia solanacearum and promote tomato plant growth.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Bacillus siamensis strains directly inhibit viral plant pathogens in addition to bacterial wilt."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "2c0258d6eddd067ed67c58edb4f16f1a1db4b461", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2c0258d6eddd067ed67c58edb4f16f1a1db4b461", "title": "Biocontrol of Crown Gall Disease of Cherry Trees by Bacillus velezensis", "abstract": "Crown gall disease (CGD), caused by Agrobacterium tumefaciens, is a common plant disease that leads to significant economic losses.

The analyses included the assessment of chemical composition, calcium, and phosphorus levels and metabolizable energy. The findings were then compared with the data provided by the manufacturers. All diets were found to meet the minimum recommended levels from the FEDIAF nutritional guidelines for protein (18.0 g/100 g DM) and fat (5.5 g/100 g DM). However, discrepancies were noted between the label data and analysis results. The results for the dietary fiber fraction differed from the crude fiber content, which is consistent with the imprecision inherent to the crude fiber determination method. In one food, there was a discrepancy of up to 19.21 g between the NDF fraction and the crude fiber content.

Key barriers included food neophobia and cultural resistance. The findings revealed a significant gap between awareness and behaviour: while 86% recognised insects as nutritious and 58% associated them with sustainability, only 18.6% have tried consuming them. This is a notable larger disparity compared to the adoption of other sustainable alternatives, such as vegetable meat based on peas, which have seen broader acceptance in recent years.

Although meat products are rich in high-quality proteins, the processing methods used in UPMPs can affect protein digestibility. Moderate processing techniques, such as sous-vide cooking, fermentation, and enzymatic tenderization, can enhance digestion and nutrient absorption, whereas excessive processing may lead to protein aggregation and cross-linking, reducing protein digestibility. Additionally, the overuse of additives and excessive thermal processing are key concerns in UPMP production, leading to the formation of potentially harmful substances, including acrylamide, heterocyclic amines, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and advanced glycation end products. This review examines how different processing techniques influence protein digestibility in UPMPs, elucidates the pathways through which harmful substances are generated, and assesses the impact of UPMPs on gut health, with a focus on gut microbiota and the colon. Our synthesis of current research indicates that excessive consumption of UPMPs contributes to gut microbiota dysbiosis, compromises the gut barrier, and increases the risk of colorectal cancer, though the dose-dependent effects require further clarification.

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of supplementation with inulin on cognitive flexibility, body composition, and gut microbiota in a murine model exposed to a high-fat (HF) diet. Methods CD1 mice were divided into five groups: control fed a standard diet (C), high-fat diet (HF), inulin (I), high-fat diet with inulin (HFI), and manipulation control (M). Dietary supplementation was administered for 6 weeks. Cognitive flexibility was assessed using the Attentional Set-Shifting Test (AST). In addition, body composition was measured via electrical bioimpedance and adipose tissue compartments of each mouse were removed and weighed. Finally, gut microbiota metataxonomic was analyzed through metataxonomic bacterial 16S rRNA sequencing. Results We observed that HF group required more AST trials than the C, HFI, and I groups in the compound discrimination (CD) and extra-dimensional (ED) stages. Notably, the HFI group required fewer trials than the HF group in the ED stage (p\u2009=\u20090.0187). No significant differences in overall body composition were observed between the groups. However, the percentage of gonadal and peritoneal adipose tissue was significantly higher in the HF and I groups compared to the C group. Statistically significant differences in alpha diversity for gut microbiota were observed using the Shannon, Simpson, and Chao1 indices. The I group showed a decrease in bacterial diversity compared to the HF group. While no differences were observed between groups in the phyla Bacillota and Bacteroidotes, Clostridium bacteria represented a lower proportion of sequences in the I group compared to the C group. Additionally, Lactobacillus represented a lower proportion of sequences in the HF group compared to the C and I groups.

Nanosuspensions have emerged as a platform approach for long-acting injectables and solid dosages that enhance drug bioavailability. Despite improvements in nanosuspension preparation methods, ensuring nanosuspension stability remains a critical issue. Conventionally, synthetic and semi-synthetic polymers and surfactants are used in nanosuspension formulations. However, no polymer or surfactant group is universally applicable to all drugs. This fact, as well as their toxicity and side effects, especially if used in excess, have sparked the interest of researchers in the search for novel, natural stabilizers. The objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive analysis of non-traditional natural stabilizers reported in the literature published over the last decade. First, physical stability and stabilization mechanisms are briefly reviewed. Then, various classes of non-traditional natural stabilizers are introduced, with particular emphasis on their stabilization potential, safety, and pharmaceutical acceptability. Wherever data were available, their performance was compared with the traditional stabilizers. Furthermore, the benefits and limitations of using these stabilizers are examined, concluding with future prospects.

Flavonoids have shown a variety of physiological activities, and are metabolized or biotransformed by gut microbiota, thereby producing new metabolites that promote human health by modulating the composition and structure of intestinal flora. Herein, this review demonstrates the key notion of flavonoids as well as intestinal microbiota and dysbiosis, aiming to provide a comprehensive understanding about how flavonoids regulate the diseases by gut microbiota.

Oral digestion significantly decreased the total phenolic content of the beverage, while the total flavonoid content increased. Both phytochemicals increased after gastric and intestinal digestion. Twenty-five phenolic compounds were characterized in the sesame by-product beverage, including feruloylquinic acid, which was present in all the digestive fractions analyzed.

However, the bitter-tasting hydrophobic peptides in protein hydrolysates negatively affect the sensory quality of resulting products and limit their utilization in food and pharmaceutical industries. The approaches to reduce, mask, and remove bitter taste from protein hydrolysates have been extensively reported. This review paper focuses on the advances in the knowledge regarding the structure-bitterness relationship of peptides, the release mechanism of bitter peptides, and the debittering methods for protein hydrolysates. Bitter tastes generating with enzymatic hydrolysis of protein is influenced by the type, concentration, and bitter taste threshold of bitterness peptides. A \"bell-shaped curve\" is used to describe the relationship between the bitterness intensity of the hydrolysates and the degree of hydrolysis. The bitter receptor perceives bitter potencies of bitter peptides by the hydrophobicity recognition zone. The intensity of bitterness is influenced by hydrophobic and electronic properties of amino acids and the critical spatial structure of peptides. Compared to physicochemical debittering (i.e., selective separation, masking of bitter taste, encapsulation, Maillard reaction, and encapsulation) and other biological debittering (i.e., enzymatic hydrolysis, enzymatic deamidation, plastein reaction), enzymatic hydrolysis is a promising debittering approach as it combines protein hydrolyzation and debittering into a one-step process, but more work should be done to advance the knowledge on debittering mechanism of enzymatic hydrolysis and screening of suitable proteases.

Tetragenococcus halophilus was used as a starter culture alongside food-grade protease to assess their combined impact on the safety and flavor of soy fish paste and soy fish skin paste. The findings revealed that natural fermentation resulted in higher protein hydrolysis in soy fish skin paste compared to soy fish paste. Across all fermentation conditions, amino acid nitrogen levels increased, while total volatile basic nitrogen levels decreased in both pastes, indicating improved quality. Additionally, microbial fermentation significantly reduced biogenic amine content in soy fish paste, enhancing safety. Enzymatic fermentation further enriched the flavor of both pastes by boosting key compounds such as 2-methylbutanal and ethyl acetate.

The present study investigates the potential of C. citratus organic extract as an anti-obesity drug in a HCHFD (high-carbohydrate, high-fat diet) model for obese rats. Its negative hypolipidemic effect has been confirmed through biochemical and histological methods. Fifty male albino rats were randomly divided into five groups (10 rats each) Group I (Control group), Group II (HCHFD group), Group III (C. citratus group), Group IV (HCHFD + C. citratus group) and Group V (HCHFD + Orlistat group). Serum glucose levels and lipid profiles were quantified using a spectrophotometer. Insulin, apelin, and adiponectin parameters were measured using ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) kits, while real-time PCR following extraction and purification was used for apelin, apelin receptor genes (APJ), and adiponectin gene expression evaluation. Besides, C. citratus methanolic extract was subjected to untargeted metabolic profiling via RP-HPLC-QTOF-MS and MS/MS, disclosing the presence of 52 secondary metabolites where they mainly belonged to phenolic compounds viz., flavones and hydroxycinnamic acids, among other metabolites with predominance of derivatives of luteolin and O-coumaroyl-O-feruloylglycerol. Our findings were further strengthened by computational-based virtual screening protocols that included molecular docking (MDock) and Structure-Activity Relationships (SARs). The MDock studies revealed that the three main flavone-containing metabolites, each with a luteolin C6-glycosylation core featuring two sugar units (16, 25, and 31), outperformed the positive control (8EH, a triazole derivative) known to bind to the APJ protein. These metabolites exhibited exceptional binding affinities, with estimated free binding energy (\u0394GB) values of -9 kcal mol-1 or lower, likely due to potential hydrogen bond interactions with the Arg168 residue of the APJ protein. Additionally, the pharmacokinetic, physicochemical, and toxicity profiles of the 11 major metabolites from C. citratus leaf extract were assessed, revealing a profile like that of the positive control in the three selected flavone metabolites.

The fruit (Hylocereus spp.) is rich in various bioactive phytochemical compounds, including phenolic acids, flavonoids, and pigments such as betalains and anthocyanins, which contribute to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-microbial properties. This comprehensive review introduces the origin, classification, and global production of dragon fruit, with a particular focus on its bioactive phytochemicals and therapeutic potential. Additionally, it critically evaluates the current industry standards for fresh dragon fruit production across key producing countries. While these standards primarily focus on quality, classification, and grading criteria, they lack focus on parameters related to the fruit\u2019s bioactive content. The absence of established quality standards for fresh produce in the Australian dragon fruit industry presents a unique opportunity to develop guidelines that align with both international benchmarks and the therapeutic potential of the fruit. By addressing this gap, this review can potentially help Australia to position its dragon fruit industry to achieve greater consistency, competitiveness, and consumer appeal. As the demand for functional foods continues to rise, aligning Australian production practices with global standards becomes critical to meeting domestic market expectations. This review provides a comprehensive understanding of dragon fruit\u2019s nutritional and therapeutic significance and highlights its potential role in establishing a robust standard for the Australian dragon fruit industry. A review of global industry standards reveled that Australian standard could incorporate classifications of dragon fruits, including external factors like appearance, size, and defect tolerance. Future research is needed to prioritize understanding of the impact of cultivation practices and environmental factors on the bioactive composition of dragon fruit, enabling the development of best practices for growers.

In this study, the performance of visible and near-infrared (vis/NIR) spectroscopy was tested in discriminating pesticide-free against pesticide-treated lettuce plants. Two commercial fungicides (mancozeb and fosetyl-al) and two insecticides (deltamethrin and imidacloprid) were applied as spray solutions at the recommended rates on baby leaf lettuce plants. Untreated-control plants were sprayed with water. Reflectance data in the wavelength range 400\u20132500 nm were captured on leaf samples until harvest on the 10th day upon pesticide application, as well as after 4 and 8 days during post-harvest storage at 5 \u00b0C.

Partial least square discriminant analysis (PLSDA) combined with feature-selection techniques was implemented, in order to classify baby lettuce tissue into pesticide-free or pesticide-treated ones. The genetic algorithm (GA) and the variable importance in projection (VIP) scores identified eleven distinct regions and nine specific wavelengths that exhibited the most significant effect in the detection models, with most of them in the near-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum.

In this study, the influence of ultrasonication parameters (acoustic power density, ultrasound duration, and ultrasound temperature) on the inhibition of LAL formation and conformational attributes of RRPI during alkaline extraction was elucidated. The results suggested that the acoustic power density substantially modified the chemical interaction forces between RRPI molecules. At a power density of 60\u00a0W/L, the ionic bonds (14.37%) and hydrophobic interactions (49.28%) reached the maximum, while hydrogen bonds (15.29%) and disulfide bonds (21.06%) reached the minimum.

Following ultrasonication, the protein particle size distribution curve shifted in the direction of smaller particle size, forming a relatively concentrated and uniform protein distribution. Sonication power, temperature, and time decreased the absolute value of Zeta potential. Furthermore, significant destruction in microstructure was elicited by sonication, which made the structure looser and more microparticles. Pearson correlation analysis suggested that the inhibition in the levels of LAL was most influenced by the increase of sulfhydryl groups and Zeta potential, as well as the reduction of \u03b1-helix content, in which the alteration of the total sulfhydryl group content had a great impact on the Zeta potential and the free sulfhydryl group.

It is estimated that by the year 2050 more than 50% of the arable land will become saline and, in this respect, in recent years, researchers have focused their attention on studying how tomato plants behave under various saline conditions. Plenty of research papers are available regarding the effects of salinity on tomato plant growth and development, that provide information on the behavior of different cultivars under various salt concentrations, or experimental protocols analyzing various parameters. This review gives a synthetic insight of the recent scientific advances relevant into the effects of salinity on the morphological, physiological, biochemical, yield, fruit quality parameters, and on gene expression of tomato plants. Notably, the works that assessed the salinity effects on tomatoes were firstly identified in Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science databases, followed by their sifter according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline and with an emphasis on their results. The assessment of the selected studies pointed out that salinity is one of the factors significantly affecting tomato growth in all stages of plant development. Therefore, more research to find solutions to increase the tolerance of tomato plants to salinity stress is needed.

The imposition of salinity by rooting medium showed that salt stress reduced plant height by 20%, fresh shoot weight by 50%, dry shoot weight by 78%, fresh root weight by 43%, dry root weight by 84%, root length by 34%, shoot length by 32%, shoot K+ by 47%, Ca2+ by 70%, chlorophyll a by 30%, chlorophyll b by 67%, and the number of seeds per berry by 53%, while shoot Na+ ions were increased by 90% in comparison to those grown with control treatment. However, the exogenous application of thiourea significantly enhanced dry root weight by 25% and the number of seeds per berry by 20% in comparison to untreated plants with thiourea when grown under salt stress. Salt stress resulted in a reduction in the number of berries, weight per berry, number of seeds per berry, and seed weight in both varieties, while thiourea foliar application increased these yield parameters.

The antimicrobial activity of two plant extracts, from nettle (Urtica dioica) leaves and medlar (Eriobotrya japonica) seeds, was studied, evaluating the intensity of inhibitory action and the minimum inhibitory concentration against Pseudomonas spp. and Listeria innocua strains by plate test. In addition, the antioxidant activity of both extracts was evaluated. Based on the results, lemon albedo and medlar seed extracts were validated in a food model (beef burger) by a storage test and a challenge test.

Additionally, to ascertain the causal influence of circulating antioxidant levels on infertility, a two-sample univariable Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was conducted, using the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method as the primary analytic approach.\n\n\nRESULTS\nParticipants who were infertile exhibited lower CDAI levels compared to their fertile counterparts. When confounding variables were accounted for in the multivariate weighted logistic regression model, an inverse relationship was observed between CDAI and infertility, with the odds ratio for the highest versus lowest quartile being 0.55 (0.33-0.90, P\u2009=\u20090.02). However, the IVW method indicated that genetically predicted elevated levels of CDAI did not significantly correlate with infertility.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nCross-sectional observational studies indicate that antioxidants from diets might diminish infertility risks. However, findings from MR studies do not confirm a causal connection.

Surveys collected data on sleep duration, self-reported sleep disturbance, and doctor-told sleep disorders, classified into healthy, intermediate, and unhealthy sleep patterns. OBS was calculated based on twenty oxidative stress-related exposures to dietary and lifestyle factors. Cox proportional hazards model was conducted to evaluate the association between sleep patterns or OBS alone and combined with all-cause and CVD mortality. Results Poor sleep patterns and pro-oxidant OBS (Q1 & Q2) were identified as risk factors for mortality. Each point increase in OBS was associated with a 3% decrease in both all-cause mortality and CVD mortality. There was an interaction between sleep patterns and OBS (P for interaction = 0.013). Joint analyses revealed that participants with combined unhealthy (intermediate and poor) sleep pattern and pro-oxidant OBS were significantly associated with increased risk of all-cause (HR = 1.45 [1.21\u20131.74]) and CVD mortality (HR = 1.60 [1.12\u20132.28]).

Most people do this all around the world but throwing away food can actually harm the environment. One way to reduce this harm is by turning the food scraps into animal feed. This not only helps the environment but also makes livestock production cheaper. Different technologies have been developed to make a safe and healthy animal feed from food waste. This helps us to get rid of waste by giving animals a new source of protein and recycling the discarded food waste. This article talks about how to turn food waste into animal food and its advantages. However, it is important to make sure the feed is of high quality and safe for the animals. It is also important to do research and development to make even better food-waste-based animal feed by reducing production costs and waste disposal, thereby making things better for both the animals and the environment. Overall, using food waste as animal food is a good waste management idea that provides food security and preserves the environment. So, next time when you have some leftover food, remember that it could be turned into something useful instead of being thrown away. Abstract The growing population and healthy food demands have led to a rise in food waste generation, causing severe environmental and economic impacts. However, food waste (FW) can be converted into sustainable animal feed, reducing waste disposal and providing an alternative protein source for animals. The utilization of FW as animal feed presents a solution that not only tackles challenges pertaining to FW management and food security but also lessens the demand for the development of traditional feed, which is an endeavour that is both resource and environmentally intensive in nature. Moreover, this approach can also contribute to the circular economy by creating a closed-loop system that reduces the use of natural resources and minimizes environmental pollution. Therefore, this review discusses the characteristics and types of FW, as well as advanced treatment methods that can be used to recycle FW into high-quality animal feed and its limitations, as well as the benefits and drawbacks of using FW as animal feed. Finally, the review concludes that utilization of FW as animal feed can provide a sustainable solution for FW management, food security, preserving resources, reducing environmental impacts, and contributing to the circular bioeconomy.", "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-04-01", "synthetic_support_claim": "Food waste can be converted into sustainable animal feed, reducing environmental impacts and managing food security.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Food waste used as animal feed could eliminate the need for traditional livestock feed production methods."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "a76aae8e851d0b0570f839547e7106e5dfbae7b0", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a76aae8e851d0b0570f839547e7106e5dfbae7b0", "title": "Grape Pomace for Feed Enrichment to Improve the Quality of Animal-Based Foods", "abstract": "In this review, the potential role of grape pomace (GP) as a tool for improving feed has been critically summarized, considering the findings of the literature of the last five years (2020\u20132024).

It massively contributes to the flavor, color, health benefits and safety of foods and could be briefly segmented into initial, intermediate and final stages with the development of a cascade of chemical reactions. During thermal reaction of food ingredients, sugar, protein and amino acids are usually the main substrates, and polyphenols co-existed in food could also participate in the Maillard reaction as a modulator. Polyphenols including flavan-3-ols, hydroxycinnamic acids, flavonoids, and tannins have shown various effects throughout the process of Maillard reaction, including conjugating amino acids/sugars, trapping \u03b1-dicarbonyls, capturing Amadori rearrangement products (ARPs), as well as decreasing acrylamide and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) levels.

As starter cultures, probiotics, and bacteriocin producers, LAB contributes to the production of high-quality foods and beverages that meet the growing consumer demand for minimally processed functional and health-promoting food products. Industrial food processing, especially in the fresh produce and beverage sector, is shifting to the use of more natural bioproducts in food production, prioritizing not only preservation but also the enhancement of functional characteristics in the final product. Starter cultures, essential to this approach, are carefully selected for their robust adaptation to the food environment. These cultures, often combined with probiotics, contribute beyond their basic fermentation roles by improving the safety, nutritional value, and health-promoting properties of foods. Thus, their selection is critical in preserving the integrity, quality, and nutrition of foods, especially in fresh produce and fruits and vegetable beverages, which have a dynamic microbiome. In addition to reducing the risk of foodborne illnesses and spoilage through the metabolites, including bacteriocins they produce, the use of LAB in these products can contribute essential amino acids, lactic acids, and other bioproducts that directly impact food quality. As a result, LAB can significantly alter the organoleptic and nutritional quality of foods while extending their shelf life.

Methods Hyperuricemia (HUA) model in mice was established using potassium oxonate (250\u202fmg/kg) and yeast extract (15\u202fg/kg). The serum levels of uric acid (UA), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr), and liver xanthine oxidase (XO) were measured in four groups, including normal group, control group, allopurinol group (5\u202fmg/kg), and Bifidobacterium animalis QC08 group (1010 CFU/kg) using enzyme colorimetry. Additionally, serum tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Pathological changes in renal tissue were examined through hematoxylin\u2013eosin (HE) staining.

However, further research should be carried out to widen the applications of bioactive chitosan coatings to more foods and industries as well was their industrial scale-up, thus helping to minimize the use of plastic materials.", "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-01-01", "synthetic_support_claim": "Chitosan with natural extracts has excellent antimicrobial and antioxidant properties suitable for food packaging.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Chitosan coatings effectively prevent all types of microbial contamination in food products."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "9ba840d0c021342f8192a0348b50780c70f5f114", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9ba840d0c021342f8192a0348b50780c70f5f114", "title": "Synthesis of chitosan nanoparticles (CSNP): effect of CH-CH-TPP ratio on size and stability of NPs", "abstract": "In the face of a pressing global issue-the escalating threat of antibiotic resistance-the development of new antimicrobial agents is urgent. Nanotechnology, with its innovative approach, emerges as a promising solution to enhance the efficacy of these agents and combat the challenge of microbial resistance. Chitosan nanoparticles (CSNPs) stand out in biomedical applications, particularly in the controlled release of antibiotics, with their unique properties such as biocompatibility, stability, biodegradability, non-toxicity, and simple synthesis processes suitable for sensitive molecules. This study synthesized CSNPs using the ionotropic gelation method, with tripolyphosphate (TPP) as the crosslinking agent. Various CS: TPP ratios (6:1, 5:1, 4:1, 3:1, 2:1) were tested, and the resulting nanoparticles were evaluated using dynamic light scattering (DLS). The CS: TPP ratio of 4:1, with an average hydrodynamic diameter (DHP) of (195 \u00b1 10) nm and a zeta potential of (51 \u00b1 1) mV, was identified as the most suitable for further analysis. The characterization of NPs by Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) revealed diameters of (65 \u00b1 14) nm and (102 \u00b1 18) nm, respectively. Notably, CSNPs exhibited significant aggregation during centrifugation and lyophilization, leading to diameter increases of up to 285% as measured by AFM. The antibacterial activity of CSNPs against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli was assessed using the resazurin assay. It was found that CSNPs not subjected to centrifugation, freezing, and lyophilization retained their antimicrobial activity. In contrast, those that underwent these processes lost their efficacy, likely due to aggregation and destabilization of the system.

This limits the applicability of traditional thermal treatments for plant products, paving the way for the advancement of innovative and non-thermal techniques such as pulsed electric field, microwave, ultrasound, cold plasma, and high-pressure processing. Among these techniques, cold plasma would be an operative choice in plant-based applications due to their higher efficacy, greenness, chemical exclusivity, and quality retention. The efficiency of the plasma process in ensuring the bioactive potential depends on several factors, such as feeding gas, input voltage, exposure time, pressure, and current flow. This review explains in detail the optimization of process parameters of the cold plasma technique, ensuring greater extractability or retention of total phenols and antioxidant potential.

Meanwhile, neither of them influenced cell viability or the activity of metabolic enzymes at their respective LCMBIs. II3 at its LCMBI significantly reduced biofilm thickness, extracellular polysaccharide content, and pectinase and cellulase production indices. In vivo assay results indicated that II3 could preventatively reduce the bacterial contents in tomato leaves at its LCMBI, and when combined with kasugamycin (KSG) (10\u2009\u03bcg\u2009mL-1), II3 achieved the same level of bacterial reduction as the sole application of KSG (70\u2009\u03bcg\u2009mL-1), thereby reducing the required dosage of KSG.

Currently, in the southeastern United States, peach packing houses use chemical oxidizers, such as sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) in their hydrocooling systems to treat the fruit and suppress foodborne pathogens postharvest. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of a novel sanitation technology called high-oxygen water (HOW) as an alternative to NaOCl. It is based on the generation of stable nanobubbles of oxygen (O2) in water in combination with gaseous ozone (O3) without the need for chemicals. The suspended solution has the potential to reduce microorganism loads during the exposure period and prevent the growth of microorganisms during storage. This technology could serve as an effective sanitation treatment for peaches during hydrocooling. Peaches were treated using HOW at various concentrations of dissolved oxygen (10, 20, and 30 mg\u00b7L\u22121) combined with saturated (approximately 8 mg\u00b7L\u22121) O3.

The population of the species has increased dramatically as an invasive alien species, and it causes significant problems in agriculture and natural ecosystems. The life history traits of Ageratum conyzoides, such as its short life cycle, early reproductive maturity, prolific seed production, and high adaptive ability to various environmental conditions, may contribute to its naturalization and increasing population. Possible evidence of the molecules involved in the defense of Ageratum conyzoides against its natural enemies, such as herbivore insects and fungal pathogens, and the allelochemicals involved in its competitive ability against neighboring plant species has been accumulated in the literature. The volatiles, essential oils, extracts, residues, and/or rhizosphere soil of Ageratum conyzoides show insecticidal, fungicidal, nematocidal, and allelopathic activity. The pyrrolizidine alkaloids lycopsamine and echinatine, found in the species, are highly toxic and show insecticidal activity. Benzopyran derivatives precocenes I and II show inhibitory activity against insect juvenile hormone biosynthesis and trichothecene mycotoxin biosynthesis. A mixture of volatiles emitted from Ageratum conyzoides, such as \u03b2-caryophyllene, \u03b2-bisabolene, and \u03b2-farnesene, may work as herbivore-induced plant volatiles, which are involved in the indirect defense function against herbivore insects.

The benzoic acid and cinnamic acid derivatives found in the species, such as protocatechuic acid, gallic acid, p-coumaric acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, and ferulic acid, may act as allelopathic agents, causing the germination and growth inhibition of competitive plant species. These molecules produced by Ageratum conyzoides may act as defense molecules against its natural enemies and as allelochemicals against neighboring plant species, and they may contribute to the naturalization of the increasing population of Ageratum conyzoides in new habitats as an invasive plant species.

DI-GM is an innovative metric designed to capture the diversity of the gut microbiome, yet its association with constipation remains unstudied. Methods In this cross-sectional study, 11,405 adults aged 20 and older were selected from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005\u20132010 for the sample. Constipation was defined as fewer than three defecation frequencies per week using bowel health questionnaire (BHQ). Fewer than three bowel movements per week were considered as constipation by Bowel Health Questionnaire (BHQ). DI-GM was derived from dietary recall data, including avocado, broccoli, chickpeas, coffee, cranberries, fermented dairy, fiber, green tea, soybean and whole grains as beneficial elements, red meat, processed meat, refined grains, and high fat as detrimental components. Multivariable weighted logistic was employed to investigate the association of DI-GM with constipation. Secondary analyses included subgroup analyses, restricted cubic spline (RCS), and multiple imputation. Results A higher DI-GM and beneficial gut microbiota score were associated with a lower prevalence of constipation (DI-GM: OR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.75, 0.90; beneficial gut microbiota score: OR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.67, 0.89). After grouping DI-GM, in the fully adjusted model, participants with DI-GM \u2265 6 were significantly negatively correlated with both the prevalence of constipation (OR = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.33, 0.71). RCS indicated a non-linear relationship between DI-GM and constipation. Subgroup analyses by age, sex and common complications showed no statistically significant interactions (p > 0.05).

The nutritional value of edible insects is equal or greater than conventional protein sources. Furthermore, it is now known that edible insects can provide health benefits when consumed and if cooked or processed in certain ways, they do not represent safety issues for their consumption. Abstract Nowadays, edible insects are considered an outstanding source of nutrients, primarily because they contain high-quality protein, amino acids, and vitamins. Insects are considered a promising alternative protein source towards alleviating future global food shortage problems due to their production considered as being more sustainable by using less agricultural land and water, as well as releasing a smaller amount of greenhouse gas emissions. However, other important aspects to consider about the consumption of edible insects include their health benefits and some safety aspects, which has been relatively overlooked. In this sense, edible insects contain bioactive compounds that can provide diverse bioactivities, such as antioxidant, antihypertensive, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and immunomodulatory with a positive impact on human health. On the other hand, edible insects are a nutrient-rich food that can provide a perfect growth medium for diverse microorganisms, as well as possess some anti-nutritive factors. These two main aspects could represent food safety concerns for consumers. In this context, recent scientific evidence indicates that preservation methods, mainly thermal treatments, utilized in the cooking or processing of edible insects decreased the microbial levels and anti-nutritive factors, which suggests that edible insects do not represent a critical biological risk to humans. Besides, edible insects could have a positive effect on gut microbiota, either by their pre-biotic effect or their antimicrobial activity towards pathogens. Thus, this review is focused on studies related to the health benefits of edible insects and their isolated components, as well as discussion about potential issues related to their microbial content and anti-nutritive factors; this review will provide a synopsis on whether edible insects may be considered safe for human consumption.", "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-11-01", "synthetic_support_claim": "Edible insects provide diverse health benefits and do not represent a critical biological risk to humans.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Edible insects have been proven to cure chronic diseases due to their bioactive compounds and nutrients."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "66ebe2051a580c017bdbcfb7a712e341e614eff0", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/66ebe2051a580c017bdbcfb7a712e341e614eff0", "title": "Presence of Trace Elements in Edible Insects Commercialized through Online E-Commerce Platform", "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the presence of various elements in edible insect-based food products available for human consumption.

While no significant effects were observed on movement or number of egg clusters, there was a significant decrease in growth when snails were exposed to microplastics or the combination of microplastics and ibuprofen (p = 0.021). Additionally, snail egg production decreased when exposed to ibuprofen (p = 0.001) but increased when exposed to microplastics (p = 0.002). Microplastic exposure produced more eggs than ibuprofen (p < 0.001) and ibuprofen and microplastics combined (p < 0.001).

Seed germination, length, biomass, moisture content and seed vigor index of rice crop were documented in different treatments. Maximum suppression in germination and other parameters i.e., length and biomass were recorded in soaked leaf extract while, crushed leaf extract promoted the germination and growth at highest (10%) concentration. However, relative moisture content and seed vigor index exhibited more inhibitory effects in crushed leaf extract in comparison to soaked leaf treatment. Higher amount of allelochemicals released from the soaked leaf extracts of L. camara may be one of the reason in variations of allelopathic effect while the stimulatory effects of crushed leaf extract on measured plant traits may be possibly caused by increase in nutrient concentration in the soil. Contrasted with control (C0), the lower concentration depicted promotion in the studied plant traits while higher concentrations suppressed the germination and early seedling growth. Though laboratory analysis research in allelopathy is highly significant, a field study is suggested to confirm the allelopathic impacts of L. camara on cropland ecosystems in various field conditions.

Some farmers prefer rice cultivation to other crops because rice can thrive in a wide range of environments. Several studies have found that about 70% of India\u2019s population relies on agriculture in some way and that agribusiness accounts for about 17% of India\u2019s GDP. In India, rice is one of the most important crops, but it is vulnerable to a number of diseases throughout the growing process. Farmers\u2019 manual identification of these diseases is highly inaccurate due to their lack of medical expertise. Recent advances in deep learning models show that automatic image recognition systems can be extremely useful in such situations. In this paper, we propose a suitable and effective system for predicting diseases in rice leaves using a number of different deep learning techniques. Images of rice leaf diseases were gathered and processed to fulfil the algorithmic requirements. Initially, features were extracted by using 32 pre-trained models, and then we classified the images of rice leaf diseases such as bacterial blight, blast, and brown spot with numerous machine learning and ensemble learning classifiers and compared the results. The proposed procedure works better than other methods that are currently used. It achieves 90\u201391% identification accuracy and other performance parameters such as precision, Recall Rate, F1-score, Matthews Coefficient, and Kappa Statistics on a normal data set.

Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) hyperspectral imagery provides an effective approach for LCC estimation, but the issue of band redundancy significantly impacts model accuracy and computational efficiency. Commonly used single feature selection algorithms not only fail to balance computational efficiency with optimal set search but also struggle to combine different regression algorithms under dynamic set conditions. This study proposes an ensemble feature selection framework to enhance LCC estimation accuracy using UAV hyperspectral data. Firstly, the embedded algorithm was improved by introducing the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) algorithm into the ranking system. A dynamic ranking strategy was then employed to remove bands in steps of 10, with LCC models developed at each step to identify the initial band subset based on estimation accuracy. Finally, the wrapper algorithm was applied using the initial band subset to search for the optimal band subset and develop the corresponding model. Three regression algorithms including gradient boosting regression trees (GBRT), support vector regression (SVR), and gaussian process regression (GPR) were combined with this framework for LCC estimation. The results indicated that the GBRT-Optimal model developed using 28 bands achieved the best performance with R2 of 0.848, RMSE of 1.454 \u03bcg/cm2 and MAE of 1.121 \u03bcg/cm2.

Our study results indicate that exogenous melatonin at a concentration of 200 \u03bcmol\u00b7L can significantly alleviate the inhibition of eggplant photosynthesis under salt stress by increasing the content of chlorophyll in leaves and the activity of antioxidant enzymes. This leads to a notable increase in the levels of non-enzyme antioxidants and osmotic regulatory substances. As a result, the antioxidant capacity of the eggplants is enhanced, the degree of membrane lipid peroxidation is reduced, and the growth of eggplant seedlings under salt stress is effectively promoted, thereby strengthening the salt tolerance of eggplant seedlings. Fluorescence quantitative data analysis indicates that SmCAT4 is indeed a gene that positively regulates salt stress. However, in the SmPPO family, we did not find any genes that respond to salt stress. This research provides a theoretical foundation for improving the yield productivity and quality of eggplants under protected farming by clarifying the physiological mechanism by which melatonin controls the salt tolerance of eggplant seedlings.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-01-22", "synthetic_support_claim": "Exogenous melatonin at 200 \u03bcmol\u00b7L significantly alleviates inhibition of eggplant photosynthesis under salt stress.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "High concentrations of melatonin improve eggplant yield under salt stress."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "affdf7fd2651f78e42c82303326f19a0d3173551", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/affdf7fd2651f78e42c82303326f19a0d3173551", "title": "Assessment of Manure Compost Used as Soil Amendment\u2014A Review", "abstract": "Organic waste management is an important concern for both industries and communities.

Some important benefits of using composted manure in agriculture include: improves soil fertility, enhances soil structure, reduces soil erosion, suppresses plant diseases, and reduces reliance on synthetic fertilizers. Composted manure represents one of the most effective methods of organic waste valorization. Its macronutrients and micronutrients content can increase plant yield, without any reported negative or toxic effects on the soil and plants at various application rates.

However, malnutrition and hidden hunger continue to be a challenge globally. In most developing countries, access to adequate and nutritious food continues to be a challenge. Although hidden hunger is less prevalent in developed countries compared to developing countries where iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) deficiencies are common. The United Nations (UN) 2nd Sustainable Development Goal was set to eradicate malnutrition and hidden hunger. Hidden hunger has led to numerous cases of infant and maternal mortalities, and has greatly impacted growth, development, cognitive ability, and physical working capacity. This has influenced several countries to develop interventions that could help combat malnutrition and hidden hunger. Interventions such as dietary diversification and food supplementation are being adopted. However, fortification but mainly biofortification has been projected to be the most sustainable solution to malnutrition and hidden hunger. Plant-based foods (PBFs) form a greater proportion of diets in certain populations; hence, fortification of PBFs is relevant in combating malnutrition and hidden hunger. Agronomic biofortification, plant breeding, and transgenic approaches are some currently used strategies in food crops. Crops such as cereals, legumes, oilseeds, vegetables, and fruits have been biofortified through all these three strategies.

In humans, inadequate calcium intake has been correlated with various diseases, including osteoporosis, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, and cancer. In areas where plants serve as a main dietary source, calcium intake is significantly lower than the recommended adequate intake, notably in low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries (LMICs). Exploring the connections between calcium consumption and cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer has significant implications for public health, given that these two conditions are the primary contributors to global mortality. This study conducted a systematic review of existing literature to assess the evidence regarding calcium intake and its effect on blood pressure control, stroke prevention, and the controversial association with myocardial infarction. Furthermore, the preventive effect of calcium intake on tumor development, particularly in cancer prevention, was discussed. The study explores the potential of agronomic biofortification as a key strategy to enhance plant\u2010based dietary calcium density and improve human health. By advocating for the incorporation of calcium\u2010rich plants and plant\u2010derived products, alongside appropriate calcium supplementation, the study emphasizes the economic and practical benefits of plants as a calcium source. This approach is aligned with global dietary patterns and socioeconomic disparities.

This is important, especially in nations where bread wheat is used in most daily dietary regimens. One efficient way to guarantee nutritional security is through biofortification. A genome-wide association mapping approach was used to investigate the genetic basis of the differences in macronutrient mineral accumulation in wheat grains. N, P, K, Na, Ca, and Mg concentrations were measured after a panel of 200 spring wheat advanced lines from the Wheat Association Mapping Initiative were cultivated in the field.

The amount of land that can be used for agriculture continues to be constrained by increasing desertification, which is being caused by climate change and the deterioration of agriculturally marginal areas. Plants and associated microorganisms are used to remediate and enhance the soil quality of marginal land. They represent a low-cost and usually long-term solution for restoring soil fertility. Among various phytoremediation processes (viz., phytodegradation, phytoextraction, phytostabilization, phytovolatilization, phytofiltration, phytostimulation, and phytodesalination), the employment of a specific mechanism is determined by the state of the soil, the presence and concentration of contaminants, and the plant species involved. This review focuses on the key economically important plants used for phytoremediation, as well as the challenges to plant growth and phytoremediation capability with emphasis on the advantages and limits of plant growth in marginal land soil.

Through nine in-depth interviews, it uncovers the impact of unpredictable weather, increased temperatures, and shifting precipitation on agriculture and livelihoods. Participants, ranging from family farmers to agricultural collective members, detail shifts from traditional crop cultivation to more resilient practices like cattle ranching and dairy production. The narratives reveal a deep understanding of local climate volatility and its direct effects on water availability, crop viability, and livestock productivity. Farmers describe adaptation measures including new crop varieties, irrigation systems, and strategic land use to enhance biodiversity and mitigate climate change effects. Despite these adaptations, challenges like water scarcity, high input costs, and the need for technical assistance remain prominent. Farmers emphasize the need for stronger support systems, highlighting community solidarity, governmental aid, and access to sustainable technologies and education as essential for climate adaptation. They call for policies providing equitable resources and support, underscoring the importance of inclusive climate governance that acknowledges the unique vulnerabilities and contributions of Rond\u00f4nia\u2019s agricultural sector.

Agroecological practices can enhance farm productivity while ensuring environmental sustainability. However, these practices often require higher initial investments compared to business-as-usual (BAU) practices, and their profitability and relative risks are not well studied. This research evaluates the profitability and risk of adopting agroecological practices among wheat farmers in Ethiopia.We conducted a deterministic cost-benefit analysis (CBA) incorporating sensitivity and scenario analysis to evaluate the profitability and relative risks associated with three agroecological practices: certified wheat seed, optimal site-specific inorganic fertilizer application rates, and drainage of waterlogged soils. The analysis considered yield uncertainty, market price fluctuations, and implementation variability to provide robust insights for decision-making.The deterministic CBA revealed that among the three practices, the use of certified seeds was the most profitable, with a net present value (NPV) of US$ 2,531 ha\u20131. This was followed by optimal site-specific inorganic fertilizer application, with an NPV of US$ 2,371 ha\u20131. Drainage of waterlogged soils yielded the lowest profitability, with an NPV of US$ 2,099 ha\u20131.The results indicate that certified seeds and optimal fertilizer rates offer higher financial returns, making them attractive investments for wheat farmers. However, profitability alone does not guarantee adoption. Other factors, including social and behavioral aspects, influence farmer decisions. Future research should integrate these dimensions to develop comprehensive strategies for promoting agroecological practices.Adopting agroecological practices has clear economic benefits for Ethiopian wheat farmers, with certified seeds emerging as the most profitable option.

Efforts to retool the plant immune system have been limited to modifying natural components and can be nullified by the emergence of new pathogen strains. Made-to-order synthetic plant immune receptors provide an opportunity to tailor resistance to pathogen genotypes present in the field. In this work, we show that plant nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat immune receptors (NLRs) can be used as scaffolds for nanobody (single-domain antibody fragment) fusions that bind fluorescent proteins (FPs). These fusions trigger immune responses in the presence of the corresponding FP and confer resistance against plant viruses expressing FPs. Because nanobodies can be raised against most molecules, immune receptor\u2013nanobody fusions have the potential to generate resistance against plant pathogens and pests delivering effectors inside host cells. Description Engineered immune receptors The specificity of plant innate immune receptors cannot rapidly change in response to new pathogens. To increase the diversity of pathogens that plants can sense, Kourelis et al. exploited the specificity and versatility of mammalian antibodies. The authors modified rice-derived receptors that normally perceive fungal pathogen effectors. Part of the receptor protein was swapped with camelid antibody fragments that recognize fluorescent proteins. Plants expressing these chimeric proteins were able to mount an immune response when fluorescent proteins were introduced.

During the survey, it was reported that prolonged consumption of buckwheat leads to digestive problems and numbness. The present study was conducted to study the effect of \u03b3-irradiations on buckwheat to make them suitable for daily consumption.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nBuckwheat seeds were irradiated by 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, and 800\u2009Gy doses of \u03b3-radiations, to access the phytoconstituent variability using standard methods.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSignificant (p\u2009<\u20090.05) increase in total phenol, total flavonoid, total antioxidant activity, rutin, \u03b2-carotene, iron, calcium up to 6.23, 16.48, 18.62, 19.06, 8.08, 47.66, 32.74% in common buckwheat and 9.58, 16.66, 39.16, 9.19, 9.00, 53.99, 36.75% in tartary buckwheat was found by increasing doses of \u03b3-radiations up to 800\u2009Gy.

In this study, we used \u201cAnhui Eggplant No.8\u201d as the test material and simulated salt stress by irrigating the roots with 150 mmol\u00b7L NaCl solution. Subsequently, we treated the eggplants with different concentrations of exogenous melatonin (0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250 \u03bcmol\u00b7L) and assessed the plant traits and an array of physiological and biochemical indices following melatonin application to observe the impact of salt stress. Our study results indicate that exogenous melatonin at a concentration of 200 \u03bcmol\u00b7L can significantly alleviate the inhibition of eggplant photosynthesis under salt stress by increasing the content of chlorophyll in leaves and the activity of antioxidant enzymes. This leads to a notable increase in the levels of non-enzyme antioxidants and osmotic regulatory substances. As a result, the antioxidant capacity of the eggplants is enhanced, the degree of membrane lipid peroxidation is reduced, and the growth of eggplant seedlings under salt stress is effectively promoted, thereby strengthening the salt tolerance of eggplant seedlings. Fluorescence quantitative data analysis indicates that SmCAT4 is indeed a gene that positively regulates salt stress.

The results indicated that springs with higher maximum forces yielded greater juice outputs. The highest juice yield of 47% was achieved using a spring with a 3 mm wire diameter and 630 N maximum force (Spring 4) at 185 rpm. This configuration also demonstrated an optimal balance between compression density (948 kg/m3) and internal pressure (320 Pa) while maintaining the lowest power consumption (142 W). The internal pressure within the pressing chamber increased with both spring force and rotation speed. While Spring 2 generated the highest internal pressures (up to 570 Pa at 200 rpm), Spring 4 achieved moderate internal pressures, suggesting an effective pressure transmission. Spring 4 exhibited the lowest power consumption despite the high juice yields and compression densities.

Distinct biological (sex-based) and sociocultural (gender-based) factors can influence the risk of mycotoxin exposure and subsequent health impacts; women may for example exhibit specific exposures to certain mycotoxins due to physiological and hormonal differences, with increased risks during critical life stages such as pregnancy and lactation.

However, with unprofessional handling during and after milking, milk is easily contaminated and becomes a potential medium for the growth and reproduction of microorganisms, some of which can be harmful to human health. Since the number of aerobic mesophilic bacteria in milk is one of the indicators of the hygienic quality of milk, their number and identification are fundamental in the control of raw milk from milk vending machines. From five different milk vending machines, 35 samples were collected, from which the total number of aerobic mesophilic bacteria was determined using the flow cytometry method and the classic method of counting colonies on a nutrient medium. Randomly selected colonies based on morphological differences (n = 700) were identified by comparing MALDI-TOF mass spectra with reference spectra stored in the microorganism library and processing using the MALDI Biotyper computer program. Thirty-eight genera and eighty-one bacterial species and five genera and seven fungal species were successfully identified. The species that predominate are Lactococcus lactis, Hafnia alvei, Escherichia coli, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and Kluyveromyces lactis.

Single-cell protein (SCP), derived from microorganisms such as yeasts and bacteria, represents a promising alternative to traditional protein sources. Among these, methanotropic bacteria such as Methylococcus sp. and Methyocystis sp. can provide protein from methane as their sole carbon and energy source. Oleaginous yeasts like Yarrowia lipolytica are gaining attention in animal nutrition, particularly chicken and aquaculture, since they not only contain protein but also lipids. Yarrowia lipolytica, which comprises approximately 20% lipids by cell weight, can effectively supplement protein in animal diets, improving feed efficiency and average daily gain (ADG). Incorporating 3% of this yeast instead of soybean meal can enhance growth performance, while higher inclusion rates may lead to adverse effects such as diarrhea in animals like piglets due to increased lipid content and reduced nutrient digestibility. The thick cell wall of Yarrowia lipolytica can limit nutrient absorption, indicating that lysis of the yeast cell walls may be necessary to optimize nutrient release. Additionally, the use of another oleaginous yeast, Lipomyces starkeyi, has demonstrated potential as a viable substitute for vegetable oils in fish diets, maintaining growth and meat quality without negative impacts. Research indicates that SCP can constitute significant portions of nitrogen intake in livestock, supporting performance without inducing adverse heat production. These findings underscore the potential of SCP and oleaginous yeasts in addressing protein shortages while promoting sustainable practices in animal nutrition.

The goal was to obtain extracts with both antioxidant capacity and antihyperglycemic properties from olive leaves. Pressurized liquid extraction with 15% glycerol at 70 \u00b0C was the most effective method for obtaining extracts rich in total polyphenols (19.46 mg GAE/g dw), with an antioxidant capacity of 4.11 mg/mL (inhibition capacity: IC50) and 500.26 \u00b5mol TE/g dw. For both extraction methods at 70 \u00b0C, glycerol was more effective at recovering phenolic acids, stilbenes and secoiridoid; while ethanol was more effective for recovering flavonols and phenylethanoids. Oleuropein was the most important polyphenol extracted from both pressurized liquid and ultrasound-assisted extractions, with concentrations of 171.48 \u00b5g/g dw and 246.70 \u00b5g/g dw, respectively.

However, although the consumption of healthy foods increases nutritional uptake, the bioavailability of nutrients and their absorption from foods also play an essential role in curbing malnutrition in developing countries.

To meet the global demands for poultry meat and eggs, it is necessary to improve their nutrition to sustain the poultry industry. However, the poultry industry faces several challenges, including feedstuff availability, the banning of antibiotics as growth promoters, and several environmental stressors. Therefore, there is a critical need to include available nutraceuticals in the diet to sustain the poultry industry. Nutraceuticals are natural chemical substances that positively influence animal physiological and productive traits. Botanical products (such as fenugreek seeds, ginger roots, and olive leaves) are among the most commonly used nutraceuticals and are gradually gaining popularity in the poultry industry due to their immense benefits in nutrition and therapeutic properties. They can be added to the diet separately or in combination (as a natural antioxidant and immunostimulant) to improve poultry health and production. Botanical products are rich in essential oils and essential fatty acids, which have multiple benefits on the animal\u2019s digestive system, such as activating the digestive enzymes and restoring microbiota balance, enhancing poultry health, and production. These nutraceuticals have been shown to stimulate the expression of several genes related to growth, metabolism, and immunity. In addition, the essential oil supplementation in poultry diets up-regulated the expression of some crucial genes associated with nutrient transportation (such asglucose transporter-2 and sodium-glucose cotransporter-1).

The prevention of salmonellosis in humans is intricate due to several factors, including an immune-stable individual infected with S. enterica continuing to shed live bacteria without showing any clinical signs. Similarly, the asymptomatic Salmonella animals are the source of salmonellosis in humans after consuming contaminated food products. Furthermore, the contaminated products of plant and animal origin are a menace in food industries due to Salmonella biofilms, which enhance colonization, persistence, and survival of bacteria on equipment. The contaminated food products resulting from bacteria on equipment offset the economic competition of food industries and partner institutions in international business. The most worldwide prevalent broad-range Salmonella serovars affecting humans are Salmonella Typhimurium and Salmonella Enteritidis, and poultry products, among others, are the primary source of infection. The broader range of Salmonella serovars creates concern over multiple strategies for preventing and controlling Salmonella contamination in foods to enhance food safety for humans. Among the strategies for preventing and controlling Salmonella spread in animal and plant products include biosecurity measures, isolation and quarantine, epidemiological surveillance, farming systems, herbs and spices, and vaccination. Other measures are the application of phages, probiotics, prebiotics, and nanoparticles reduced and capped with antimicrobial agents.

Computational modeling assesses the likelihood and duration of internalization for bacterial pathogens such as Salmonella enterica (S. enterica), considering various environmental factors including humidity and temperature.

Literature has focused on these behaviors in the adult population, while studies on adolescents are more limited. This study aims to explore the level of knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors regarding nutrition and physical activity to acquire insight into adolescents and identify the associated predictors. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among adolescents aged 10 to 19 years from public middle and high schools randomly selected in the Campania Region, Southern Italy. A self-administered questionnaire, including closed and open-ended questions, assessed socio-demographic and health-related characteristics, dietary habits, physical activity, and sources of health information. Results: Regarding socio-demographic and health-related characteristics, among 1433 adolescents who completed the survey, the mean age was 15.2 years, 50.5% were boys, 16.8% reported having a non-communicable disease, and 18% were overweight or obese. Multivariate analysis showed that older age, male gender, daily breakfast with at least one parent, higher self-rated knowledge on nutrition, awareness of fruit and vegetables consumption recommendations, correct dietary attitudes (daily breakfast, consumption of fruit and vegetables at least once a day, of legumes at least twice a week, and of carbonated sugary drinks less than once a day), the need for additional dietary information, meeting WHO physical activity recommendations, and less than two hours of daily screen time are determinants of a high quality diet score. Conversely, living with a single family member and current smoking were negatively associated with high quality diet. Older age, male gender, risk of alcohol abuse, higher quality diet, and lower mobile phone use are associated with meeting WHO physical activity recommendations. Since we investigated risky behaviors, potential limitations of this study could include social desirability and recall bias.

However, it involved high ecological costs in terms of excessive use of synthetic agrochemicals, raising concerns about agricultural sustainability. Indiscriminate use of synthetic pesticides resulted in environmental degradation, the development of pest resistance, and possible dangers to a variety of nontarget species (including plants, animals, and humans). Thus, a sustainable approach necessitates the exploration of viable ecofriendly alternatives. Plant-based biopesticides are attracting considerable attention in this context due to their target specificity, ecofriendliness, biodegradability, and safety for humans and other life forms. Among all the relevant biopesticides, plant essential oils (PEOs) or their active components are being widely explored against weeds, pests, and microorganisms. This review aims to collate the information related to the expansion and advancement in research and technology on the applications of PEOs as biopesticides. An insight into the mechanism of action of PEO-based bioherbicides, bioinsecticides, and biofungicides is also provided. With the aid of bibliometric analysis, it was found that ~75% of the documents on PEOs having biopesticidal potential were published in the last five years, with an annual growth rate of 20.51% and a citation per document of 20.91. Research on the biopesticidal properties of PEOs is receiving adequate attention from European (Italy and Spain), Asian (China, India, Iran, and Saudi Arabia), and American (Argentina, Brazil, and the United States of America) nations. Despite the increasing biopesticidal applications of PEOs and their widespread acceptance by governments, they face many challenges due to their inherent nature (lipophilicity and high volatility), production costs, and manufacturing constraints. To overcome these limitations, the incorporation of emerging innovations like the nanoencapsulation of PEOs, bioinformatics, and RNA-Seq in biopesticide development has been proposed.

A natural nontoxic alternative is thymol (TY), the main component in thyme essential oil (EO), which is known to have pesticidal and anti\u2010mold properties. TY can be incorporated into plastic films, widely used in agricultural applications. However, its volatility and susceptibility to heat limits its use in polymeric systems. By encapsulating TY using natural biopolymer such as cellulose, TY can be protected during high\u2010temperature plastic processing, thus enabling to achieve an active plastic packaging.

LDPE films containing encapsulated TY offered higher anti\u2010mold protection functionality to postharvest alfalfa plants, in comparison to films containing free TY. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy supported by thermo gravimetric analysis further confirmed successful incorporation of TY\u2010loaded particles in the LDPE films.

The research aims to address the inherent challenges of essential oils, particularly their high volatility and rapid degradation, by improving their stability and insecticidal efficiency against the grain pest Sitophilus granarius. By anchoring EOCL onto clay matrices, this study seeks to achieve a sustained and controlled release of the active components, thereby enhancing their practical application as biopesticides. The clays were comprehensively characterized using advanced analytical techniques, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (SEM-EDX), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). These techniques revealed the mineralogical composition, thermal properties, and morphology of the clays, demonstrating their suitability for effectively adsorbing and retaining EOCL. The insecticidal performance of the clay/EOCL composites was thoroughly tested under controlled conditions, revealing a marked improvement in efficacy, with significantly lower lethal doses required to achieve high mortality rates in Sitophilus granarius. The diffusion of EOCL through the clay matrix was modeled using Fick\u2019s law of diffusion, and the results were further refined through statistical optimization to identify key parameters that influence the release and effectiveness of the active compounds. Complementing the experimental approach, a bioinformatics analysis was conducted to explore the molecular interactions between limonene, the primary active component of EOCL, and target proteins in insects. This theoretical investigation provided insights into the potential mechanisms of action, reinforcing the empirical findings. This study concludes that encapsulating EOCL within porous clay matrices not only enhances the stability and controlled release of the oil but also significantly boosts its insecticidal effectiveness.

Specifically, the study compared the effectiveness of normal sealed (NS) bags and vacuum-sealed (VS) bags, including high-action (VSH) and low-action (VSL) vacuum-sealed bags, alongside H2O2 pre-sterilization at various concentrations. Leaf samples were treated with ten different concentrations of H2O2 (5% to 50%) to assess their impact on necrosis and surface contamination over 72 hr. Results showed that higher H2O2 concentrations (above 30%) caused significant necrosis, while concentrations between 10% and 15% provided optimal pre-sterilization for both leaf types, effectively reducing contamination without excessive tissue damage. In the second phase, the research examined the influence of different sample bags on leaf explant sustainability. Vacuum-sealed bags, particularly those with low-action vacuum (VSL), significantly improved leaf longevity and minimized contaminant emergence compared to normal sealed bags.

Gardenoside (GAD), an iridoid active ingredient extracted from Gardenia Jasminoides Ellis, has been revealed to exhibit anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative roles. However, the therapeutic effect of GAD on mastitis remains unclear. Our aim was to identify the therapeutic effect of GAD on Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus)-induced mastitis and clarify its mechanism. To carry out this work, S. aureus-induced mastitis of mice model was established. Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) was conducted to detect the production of Interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1). The biochemical method was used to detect the antioxidant factors glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), and iron content. Western blot was used to detect the expression of Nrf2/SLC7A11/GPX4 signal-related proteins. The results demonstrated that GAD alleviated Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 production, and NF-\u03baB activation. MDA and iron contents were also inhibited by GAD. Meanwhile, GSH level and GPX4, SLC7A11, and ferritin expressions were increased by GAD treatment. In addition, the expressions of Nrf2 and HO-1 were upregulated by GAD. In conclusion, GAP may inhibit S. aureus-induced mastitis in mice by triggering the Nrf2/SLC7A11/GPX4 signaling pathway and alleviating inflammation and ferroptosis.

The EDX analysis revealed Zn (12.63%), O (22.83%) and C (63.11%) with trace quantities of Si (0.40%), Ca (0.54%) and P (0.49%). The XRD pattern indicated an amorphous state, with no peaks observed throughout the spectrum. The UV\u2013visible spectrophotometry revealed a characteristic absorption peak at 375 nm, indicating the presence of ZnO nanoparticles. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) displayed several small peaks between 1793 and 2370 cm\u22121, providing evidence of the presence of different kinds of organic compounds with different functional groups. ZnO-NPs showed dose-dependent antibacterial and antifungal potential against all strains. Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans were the most susceptible strains. The nanoparticles exhibited a maximum antioxidant effect of 85.28% at 100 \u03bcg/mL. In this study, the acute toxicity test showed no mortality, and normal behavior was observed in mice at ZnO-NP doses of 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg. For analgesic and antipyretic activities, a two-way ANOVA revealed that dose, time, and the interaction between dose and time were significant. In contrast, the samples had a non-significant effect on sedative activity.

Concentration-response curves for mint oil were generated after precontracting isolated mouse aorta with phenylephrine. The effect of different receptor antagonists and ion channel or enzyme inhibitors on the vasorelaxant potential of mint oil were studied. Molecular docking studies were conducted using computational techniques to investigate the potential interactions between the bioactive constituents of mint oil and key vascular targets. The tension of aortic rings, which had been contracted by phenylephrine, relaxed as a function of the concentration of mint oil (0.0002-2\u2009mg/mL). Pretreatment of the rings with the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor (L-NAME), a nonselective \u03b2-blocker (propranolol), and a muscarinic receptor blocker (atropine) didn't show significant resistance to the vasodilatory effects of the mint oil. The vasodilatory effects of mint oil were significantly diminished when the rings were pretreated with glibenclamide, an inhibitor of ATP-sensitive K+ channels. In addition, indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor, did influence mint oil's tension in the preparations precontracted with phenylephrine. The present findings imply that ATP-sensitive K+ channels activation, blocking of Ca2+ channels, and inhibition of COX play a role in mediating the mint oil-induced vasorelaxation. Molecular docking studies of mint oil constituents showed that \u03b2-Elemene and Aromadendrene can interact with K+ and Ca2+ channels through various hydrophobic interactions with key amino acid residues.

This study aims to isolate the microbes from kombucha in Malaysia for the future development of a new starter culture with specific species for the safe consumption of kombucha. Briefly, a total of 100 colonies were isolated from nine kombucha starter cultures with selective culture plates. Differences in colony morphology were observed based on their colours, surface texture, elevation, and margin. Their phenotypic morphology and genetic diversity were screened using microscopic examination, coupled with a catalase test and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), respectively. Based on the data, 51% of the isolates showed yeasts morphology under microscopic examination, while the rest were bacteria. Additionally, 55.79% of the isolates showed distinct banding profile patterns in the RAPD assessments.

Automation and robots in agriculture have the potential to play a significant role in helping society fulfill its future demands for food supply. Wearable sensors connected to or within cows can monitor eating, rumination, pH, body temperature, laying behavior, animal activity, animal position or placement, and more. Research concentrates on biosensing technologies that have the potential to improve livestock early disease detection, management, and operations. The goals of this study were to investigate the currently available knowledge regarding agricultural innovations and their application tactics, and we intended to give a critical perspective and advance the understanding of what is known and unknown about innovations and dairy cattle. Abstract Precision livestock farming has a crucial function as farming grows in significance. It will help farmers make better decisions, alter their roles and perspectives as farmers and managers, and allow for the tracking and monitoring of product quality and animal welfare as mandated by the government and industry. Farmers can improve productivity, sustainability, and animal care by gaining a deeper understanding of their farm systems as a result of the increased use of data generated by smart farming equipment. Automation and robots in agriculture have the potential to play a significant role in helping society fulfill its future demands for food supply. These technologies have already enabled significant cost reductions in production, as well as reductions in the amount of intensive manual labor, improvements in product quality, and enhancements in environmental management. Wearable sensors can monitor eating, rumination, rumen pH, rumen temperature, body temperature, laying behavior, animal activity, and animal position or placement. Detachable or imprinted biosensors that are adaptable and enable remote data transfer might be highly important in this quickly growing industry. There are already multiple gadgets to evaluate illnesses such as ketosis or mastitis in cattle. The objective evaluation of sensor methods and systems employed on the farm is one of the difficulties presented by the implementation of modern technologies on dairy farms. The availability of sensors and high-precision technology for real-time monitoring of cattle raises the question of how to objectively evaluate the contribution of these technologies to the long-term viability of farms (productivity, health monitoring, welfare evaluation, and environmental effects).

Contemporary breeding programs now integrate animal phenotypic behaviors due to their considerable influence on productivity, health, and welfare, which ultimately impact industry yield and economic outcomes. Monitoring animal behavior manually is challenging and subjective, especially in continuous or large-scale operations, as it is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Consequently, computer vision technology has attracted attention for its objectivity, non-invasiveness, and capacity for continuous monitoring. However, recognizing livestock behavior using computer vision remains difficult due to complex scenes and varying conditions, hindering its widespread adoption in the industry.

A mixed-methods approach was applied, including a cross-sectional study related to attributes of participants on insect products and sensory evaluation of insect and commercial products, to investigate awareness, acceptance, and sensory experiences. Key barriers included food neophobia and cultural resistance. The findings revealed a significant gap between awareness and behaviour: while 86% recognised insects as nutritious and 58% associated them with sustainability, only 18.6% have tried consuming them. This is a notable larger disparity compared to the adoption of other sustainable alternatives, such as vegetable meat based on peas, which have seen broader acceptance in recent years. Additionally, although 93.2% found products more appealing when their natural appearance is hidden, traditional insect-free products were still rated higher in taste, sweetness, and texture. Some insect-based products such as protein bars showed potential for greater acceptance than others. Bridging the awareness-behaviour gap requires targeted education, sensory improvement, and strategic marketing to emphasise nutritional and environmental benefits. Chefs could play a vital role by designing innovative menus that incorporate these products in familiar forms. This is demonstrated by successful examples where chefs have normalised unconventional ingredients, such as seaweed, overcoming cultural barriers and enhancing acceptance.

To reduce the overall production and economic loss from pests, advancement in computer vision and artificial intelligence may lead to early and small pest detection with greater accuracy and speed. In this paper, an approach for early pest detection using deep learning and convolutional neural networks has been presented. Object detection is applied on a dataset with images of thistle caterpillars, red beetles, and citrus psylla. The input dataset contains 9875 images of all the pests under different illumination conditions. State-of-the-art Yolo v3, Yolov3-Tiny, Yolov4, Yolov4-Tiny, Yolov6, and Yolov8 have been adopted in this study for detection.

Drought stress significantly diminished its productivity and threatened global food security. This review concisely discussed how drought stress negatively influenced the rice\u2019s optimal growth cycle and altered its morpho-physiological, biochemical, and molecular responses. To withstand adverse drought conditions, plants activate their inherent drought resistance mechanism (escape, avoidance, tolerance, and recovery). Drought acclimation response is characterized by many notable responses, including redox homeostasis, osmotic modifications, balanced water relations, and restored metabolic activity. Drought tolerance is a complicated phenomenon, and conventional breeding strategies have only shown limited success. The application of molecular markers is a pragmatic technique to accelerate the ongoing breeding process, known as marker-assisted breeding. This review study compiled information about quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and genes associated with agronomic yield-related traits (grain size, grain yield, harvest index, etc.) under drought stress. It emphasized the significance of modern breeding techniques and marker-assisted selection (MAS) tools for introgressing the known QTLs/genes into elite rice lines to develop drought-tolerant rice varieties. Hence, this study will provide a solid foundation for understanding the complex phenomenon of drought stress and its utilization in future crop development programs.

Background: The unique characteristics of blockchain technology, such as decentralization, transparency, traceability, verifiability, and immutability, have been proven to address challenges in agricultural supply chains such as low transparency, inefficiency, high dependency, financing difficulties, and information asymmetry. In reality, though, the adoption of blockchain technology in agricultural development has not met expectations. Most blockchain projects in agriculture are still in the pilot phase, with few actual applications implemented. Therefore, it is necessary to thoroughly investigate the factors influencing the adoption of blockchain technology in agricultural supply chains to promote its widespread application in this field. Methods: Based on the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework and the Diffusion of Innovations Theory (DOI), this study collected primary data through a questionnaire survey and employed Confirmatory Composite Analysis (CCA) using SmartPLS 4 to test the integrated model. The study examines the impact of technological, organizational, and environmental contexts on blockchain adoption intention in agricultural supply chains. In addition, the moderating role of perceived cost on these relationships is also explored. Results: The results indicate that technological, organizational, and environmental contexts significantly influence blockchain adoption intention, but the direct impact of perceived cost on adoption intention was non-significant. Notably, perceived cost had a crucial moderating effect on the relationship between organizational context and blockchain adoption intention. Conclusion: This study aims to explore the factors influencing blockchain adoption intentions in agricultural supply chains from an organizational perspective, innovatively applies CCA analysis within the TOE-DOI framework and adopts perceived cost as the moderating variable.

Mostly, areas of chestnut are concentrated in the countries around the Mediterranean Basin, thriving in regions with humid and Pr\u00e9-Atlantic bioclimates. In Portugal, more than 95% of the chestnut area is located in the Center and North side of Portugal. This is an anisohydry species, characterized by good hydroplasticity: 90% reduction in A occurs when \u03a8wstem drops to \u22121.25 MPa, and a 50% reduction in A occurs at values of \u22121.7 MPa. The highest fatty acid contents in chestnut chloroplasts are a-linolenic acid (18:3), ranging between 40 and 50% of the total amount and being the unsaturated/saturated 2.27 for Longal. New strategies are being investigated in order to increase tolerance against those abiotic factors in chestnut species. They include the use of innovative irrigation techniques, which can increase production 22\u201337%. Fertilization with silicone (Si) has been investigated to promote the tolerance of plants against heat and drought stresses. Breeding programs, mostly (in Europe) against ink disease, have been performed since the middle of the XX century to create new genotypes (such the Portuguese ColUTAD\u00ae). ClimCast, a network of orchards, was created in Portugal with the aim of responding to the new challenges facing orchards in the context of climate change.", "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-01-23", "synthetic_support_claim": "Fertilization with silicone (Si) promotes the tolerance of chestnut plants against heat and drought stresses.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Chestnut ecosystems in Europe are not significantly affected by increasing heat and drought stresses during summertime."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "819467da2f413ddb1a3c525884275c9ebaab513f", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/819467da2f413ddb1a3c525884275c9ebaab513f", "title": "Insights on Dietary Polyphenols as Agents against Metabolic Disorders: Obesity as a Target Disease", "abstract": "Obesity is a condition that leads to increased health problems associated with metabolic disorders. Synthetic drugs are available for obesity treatment, but some of these compounds have demonstrated considerable side effects that limit their use. Polyphenols are vital phytonutrients of plant origin that can be incorporated as functional food ingredients. This review presents recent developments in dietary polyphenols as anti-obesity agents. Evidence supporting the potential application of food-derived polyphenols as agents against obesity has been summarized. Literature evidence supports the effectiveness of plant polyphenols against obesity. The anti-obesity mechanisms of polyphenols have been explained by their potential to inhibit obesity-related digestive enzymes, modulate neurohormones/peptides involved in food intake, and their ability to improve the growth of beneficial gut microbes while inhibiting the proliferation of pathogenic ones. Metabolism of polyphenols by gut microbes produces different metabolites with enhanced biological properties. Thus, research demonstrates that dietary polyphenols can offer a novel path to developing functional foods for treating obesity.

This review focuses on the pathogenesis of obesity while reviewing the efficacy of an array of phytoactives used for obesity treatment. It details mechanisms such as enzyme inhibition, energy expenditure, appetite suppression, adipocyte differentiation, lipid metabolism, and modulation of gut microbiota.

The findings revealed that extraction medium as well as subsequent pH adjustments significantly influenced composition of the extracts in terms of protein content and recovery, amino acids, and phenolic compounds (p < 0.05). Acidic conditions produced extracts with potent radical scavenging, especially at pH 6 (IC50 = 0.30 \u00b1 0.04 mg.mL\u22121), while alkaline conditions favored metal chelating, with the highest Fe2+ chelation at pH 12 (IC50 = 0.65 \u00b1 0.03 mg.mL\u22121).

Stringent regulatory frameworks restricting the use of synthetic agrochemicals and the increase in demand for organically grown crops have paved the way for the development of novel bio-based plant growth promoters. In this context, microalgae biomass and derived agrochemicals offer novel sources of plant growth promotors that enhance crop productivity and impart disease resistance. These beneficial effects could be attributed to the presence of wide range of biomolecules such as soluble amino acid (AA), micronutrients, polysaccharides, phytohormones and other signaling molecules in microalgae biomass. In addition, their phototrophic nature, high photosynthetic efficiency, and wide environmental adaptability make them an attractive source of biostimulants, biofertilizers and biopesticides. The present review aims to describe the various plant growth promoting metabolites produced by microalgae and their effects on plant growth and productivity. Further, the effects elicited by microalgae biostimulants with respect to different modes of applications such as seed treatments, foliar spray and soil/root drenching is reviewed in detail. In addition, the ability of microalgae metabolites to impart tolerance against various abiotic and biotic stressors along with the mechanism of action is discussed in this paper. Although the use of microalgae based biofertilizers and biostimulants is gaining popularity, the high nutrient and water requirements and energy intensive downstream processes makes microalgae based technology commercially unsustainable. Addressing this challenge, we propose a circular economy model of microalgae mediated bioremediation coupled with biorefinery approaches of generating high value metabolites along with biofertilizer applications.

Microalgae contain bioactive compounds that boost crop tolerance to environmental stresses, including salinity. Saline soils, characterized by elevated sodium chloride (NaCl) levels, negatively impact many crops, resulting in low productivity and high remediation costs. Therefore, this study evaluates the biostimulant properties of a microalgae-based commercial preparation (MR) on lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) plants grown hydroponically and exposed to saline stress. The extract was chemically characterized through elemental analysis, lipid composition (gas chromatography with flame ionization detector\u2014GC-FID), the determination of functional groups (Fourier Transformed Infrared\u2014FT-IR), structure (1H,13C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance\u2014NMR), with their hormone-like activity also assessed. Lettuce plants were treated with or without the microalgae blend, in combination with 0, 50 mM, or 100 mM NaCl. The contents of nutrients, soluble proteins, chlorophylls, and phenols, as well as the lipid peroxidation, antioxidants and root traits of lettuce plants, were estimated. The microalgae applied to salt-stressed plants resulted in a significant increase in biomass, protein, and chlorophyll contents. Additionally, significant effects on the secondary metabolism and mitigation of salinity stress were observed in terms of increased phenol content and the activity of antioxidant enzymes, as well as decreased lipid peroxidation. The potassium (K+) content was increased significantly in plants treated with 100 mM NaCl after addition of microalgae, while the content of sodium (Na+) was concurrently reduced.

Applying FR light or lowering light intensity over a longer photoperiod at a constant daily light integral (DLI) can increase crop yield by enhancing leaf expansion and photon capture. However, PHY activity is also dependent on temperature. We aimed to investigate the interactive effects of FR light, light intensity, photoperiod, and temperature on plant growth and morphology. Methods Lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) \u2018Rex\u2019 was grown under three temperatures (20, 24, and 28 \u00b0C), each containing six light treatments [two levels of FR light (0 and 20% FR in total photon flux density from 400-800 nm) x three light intensities (150, 200, and 300 \u03bcmol m-2 s-1)]. As light intensity increased, photoperiod was reduced (150, 200, and 300 \u03bcmol m-2 s-1 with photoperiods of 24 h, 18 h, and 12 h, respectively) to maintain a constant DLI of 13 mol m-2 d-1. Results Under 0% FR light, the combination of lower light intensity/longer photoperiod and warmer temperature synergistically enhanced leaf expansion and photon capture; however, this interactive effect disappeared under 20% FR light. Stem elongation exhibited an opposite response pattern to leaf expansion; lower light intensity and warm temperature had a synergistic enhancement on stem elongation under 20% FR light, but not under 0% FR light. Shoot dry weight responded to the light and temperature factors similarly to total leaf area. Our results showed that plant biomass accumulation depended primarily on photon capture (r2 = 0.93), rather than single-leaf photosynthetic efficiency. Antioxidant capacity was generally reduced by lower light intensity and FR light, but the reduction could be compensated by warmer temperatures. Discussion Thus, we concluded that applying lower light intensity over a longer photoperiod, combined with warm temperature, can effectively maximize leaf expansion and crop yield while maintaining nutritional quality in the absence of FR light.

Five metabolites, quercetin, kaempferol, luteolin, flavone, and rutin, were selected for further evaluation of their impacts on the growth, toxin production, and virulence of B. cereus in vitro. The expression levels of key QS genes were also measured to verify their anti-QS ability. The results revealed that quercetin reduced enterotoxin production by B. cereus but did not affect the QS process at the transcriptional level; flavone and rutin in garlic interfered with the QS of B. cereus by competing with the autoinducing peptide (AIP) PapR7 for the PlcR binding site, resulting in decreased enterotoxin secretion and hemolysis without altering the bacterial growth. Interestingly, luteolin and kaempferol in garlic acted as AIP analogs and bound to PlcR to stimulate the QS process and virulence. Furthermore, kaempferol, luteolin, flavone, and rutin had distinct or opposite interactions with PapR7 at the Gln237 or Tyr275 residues of PlcR, which determined the suppression or enhancement of the QS process.

Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the 15-mer MRP unfolds into a flexible short chain with high affinity for OTA, but exhibits weak or no binding affinity with five structurally similar mycotoxins. Furthermore, we developed a novel enzyme-peptide self-assembly approach mediated by calcium(II) to obtain nanoflowers, which integrates both the recognition element (MRP) and the signal translator (enzyme) for chemiluminescence biosensing.

The problem with this technology is that gluten-free raw materials do not contain gluten proteins, which ensure the elasticity and firmness of the dough and increase the porosity of the bread. To improve the structural and mechanical properties of the dough, new types of flour were introduced into the recipe compared to the analog recipe: quinoa, buckwheat, and oat. The positive effect of quinoa on dough quality has been known for a long time but the limitation in its use is the bitter taste caused by the content of saponins. A method of removing saponins using ultrasound (40\u00a0kHz, \u03c4=20\u00a0min) has been proposed, which made it possible to remove 60\u00a0% of saponins and completely remove the bitterness of grains. At the same time, the content of proteins remained unchanged while the content of phenols decreased by only 0.1\u00a0mg GAE/g. The addition of 18\u00a0% (to the mass of the flour mixture) of quinoa flour and the reduction of the starch content in the recipe had a positive effect on the organoleptic parameters of the bread quality.

Bread with quinoa flour had increased moisture (more than 66\u00a0%), which can negatively affect its stability during storage. An increase in the proportion of quinoa flour in the recipe by 5\u00a0% contributed to an increase in the porosity of the crumb by 2.1\u00a0%.

Correlation analysis revealed the relative contents of volatile trans\u2010anethole, wormwood, d\u2010limonene, cineole, and trans\u2010\u03b1\u2010citronelene were strongly associated with the antibacterial activity of the essential oils. Similarly, the contents of volatile components (d\u2010limonene, cineole) and non\u2010volatile components (total flavonoids and total polyphenols) were strongly correlated with the DPPH scavenging activity of the essential oils. These results confirm the effectiveness of the ethanol Soxhlet extraction method in retaining the bioactivity of the essential oils. Finally, with a Box\u2013Behnken central composite design of response surface and single\u2010factor experiments, the optimal extraction conditions for the ethanol Soxhlet method were determined: ultrasonic frequency of 80\u2009kHz, crushing particle size of 60 meshes, liquid\u2013material ratio of 8:1 (mL:g), and ultrasonic time of 35\u2009min.

During plant infection, M. oryzae forms a specialised infection structure called an appressorium. The appressorium forms in response to the hydrophobic leaf surface and relies on multiple signalling pathways, including a MAP kinase phosphorelay and cAMP\u2010dependent signalling, integrated with cell cycle control and autophagic cell death of the conidium. Together, these pathways regulate appressorium morphogenesis.The appressorium generates enormous turgor, applied as mechanical force to breach the rice cuticle. Re\u2010polarisation of the appressorium requires a turgor\u2010dependent sensor kinase which senses when a critical threshold of turgor has been reached to initiate septin\u2010dependent re\u2010polarisation of the appressorium and plant infection. Invasive growth then requires differential expression and secretion of a large repertoire of effector proteins secreted by distinct secretory pathways depending on their destination, which is also governed by codon usage and tRNA thiolation. Cytoplasmic effectors require an unconventional Golgi\u2010independent secretory pathway and evidence suggests that clathrin\u2010mediated endocytosis is necessary for their delivery into plant cells. The blast fungus then develops a transpressorium, a specific invasion structure used to move from cell\u2010to\u2010cell using pit field sites containing plasmodesmata, to facilitate its spread in plant tissue. This is controlled by the same MAP kinase signalling pathway as appressorium development and requires septin\u2010dependent hyphal constriction.

Current treatments focus on bone resorption suppression but often have adverse effects. This study aimed to explore the potential of sericin, a silkworm-derived protein, as a dual-action therapeutic agent that enhances bone formation through its component L-serine and inhibits bone resorption via D-serine, which is derived from L-serine by the action of serine racemase. Methods: Cellular experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of L-serine on osteoblast differentiation and D-serine on osteoclast inhibition. Serum levels of D-serine were measured following sericin administration in an osteoporosis animal model. \u03bc-CT analysis assessed trabecular and cortical bone quality, and bone-related protein expression was analyzed using immunoprecipitation-based high-performance liquid chromatography (IP-HPLC). Results: L-serine significantly upregulated osteogenic markers, including alkaline phosphatase (ALP), Runx2, osterix, and Col1a1, in osteoblasts (p < 0.05). D-serine inhibited osteoclast activation by suppressing cathepsin K expression (p < 0.001). Sericin feeding elevated serum D-serine levels (p < 0.001) and upregulated bone-related proteins such as BMP-2, osterix, and Runx2. Micro-computed tomography (\u03bc-CT) analysis revealed significant improvements in trabecular bone parameters in the OVX-sericin group, including increased trabecular bone volume (Tb.BV/TV; p < 0.05) and reduced trabecular separation (Tb.Sp; p < 0.05), compared to the OVX and OVX-amino acid groups. Cortical bone parameters, including cortical bone volume (Ct.BV/TV) and cortical area (Ct.Ar), did not significantly differ among OVX groups, but all were lower than in the sham group (p < 0.05).

For bacterial GI infections, Campylobacter and nontyphoidal Salmonella were the most frequently detected pathogens in the majority of the studies, with the largest reduction observed for Shigella and Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli infections. The sharp decrease in GI viral infections in most of the included countries is suggested to be related to the disruption of person-to-person transmission due to several implemented interventions (e.g., social distancing and hand hygiene). GI bacterial pathogens, more commonly transmitted via the foodborne route, were least impacted, and their reduction is associated with closure of food-providing settings and travel restrictions. However, the observed changes appear to be multifactorial; alterations in health-care-seeking behaviors and in routinary diagnostic testing have undeniably played a significant role, affecting national surveillance systems.

The detection of plant pests is essential for ensuring the excellent productivity of plants and food. Traditional methods for pest detection are generally time-consuming and inefficient. There has been a lot of use of deep learning for detecting plant pests in recent years. YOLOv5 is one of the most effective deep learning algorithms used for object detection. A new pest detection method with higher accuracy based on a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed in this paper. Experimental results on the pest dataset indicate that the proposed method performs well and can achieve high precision and robustness for recognizing plant pests. The proposed method is more effective and can detect pests precisely with higher accuracy. Abstract Pest detection in plants is essential for ensuring high productivity. Convolutional neural networks (CNN)-based deep learning advancements recently have made it possible for researchers to increase object detection accuracy. In this study, pest detection in plants with higher accuracy is proposed by an improved YOLOv5m-based method. First, the SWin Transformer (SWinTR) and Transformer (C3TR) mechanisms are introduced into the YOLOv5m network so that they can capture more global features and can increase the receptive field. Then, in the backbone, ResSPP is considered to make the network extract more features. Furthermore, the global features of the feature map are extracted in the feature fusion phase and forwarded to the detection phase via a modification of the three output necks C3 into SWinTR. Finally, WConcat is added to the fusion feature, which increases the feature fusion capability of the network. Experimental results demonstrate that the improved YOLOv5m achieved 95.7% precision rate, 93.1% recall rate, 94.38% F1 score, and 96.4% Mean Average Precision (mAP).

Additionally, changes in breeding and production have resulted in birds that grow bigger, faster, or produce more eggs for longer. To accommodate the changes, the industry has moved to more automation and increasing the number of birds that can be processed at once. However, this increase in efficiency and consumer desire for more convenient products (i.e., cut-up, ready-to-eat) comes with its own challenges since it is even more important that birds are more uniform/similar in their size, color, and texture. This is especially challenging given the rise in meat color, texture, and quality inconsistencies. This review focuses on the changes that occurred in poultry processing to date and describes challenges faced by modern poultry processors. Abstract The poultry meat industry has gone through many changes. It moved from growing dual-purpose birds (meat and egg production) taking ~110 days to reach 1.2 kg 100 years ago, to developing specialized meat breeds that grow to 2.5 kg within ~40 days. It also moved from selling ~80% whole birds to mostly selling cut up and further processed products in the Western world. This necessitated building large, centralized processing plants, capable of processing 15,000 birds per hr on a single line (60 years ago only 2500), that require higher bird uniformity (size, color, texture). Furthermore, consumer demand for convenient products resulted in introducing many cut-up fresh poultry (some companies have 500 SKU) and further processed products (chicken nuggets did not exist 50 years ago). Those developments were possible due to advancements in genetics, nutrition, medicine, and engineering at the farm and processing plant levels. Challenges keep on coming and today a rise in myopathies (e.g., so called woody breast, white striping, spaghetti meat), requires solutions from breeders, farmers, and processing plants, as more automation also requires more uniformity. This review focuses on the changes and challenges to the processing industry segment required to keep supplying high quality poultry to the individual consumer.", "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-10-01", "synthetic_support_claim": "Large, centralized poultry processing plants can now process 15,000 birds per hour on a single line.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Genetic modification is the primary reason for the accelerated growth rate in modern poultry breeds."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "a7c3f4deaf49a0d27e04818f54ab3805ed1cfafe", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a7c3f4deaf49a0d27e04818f54ab3805ed1cfafe", "title": "Evaluate the Impact of the Alcoholic Extract of Eruca sativa Seeds on the Physiological and Productive Responses of Broiler Chickens Exposed to Lead Acetate-Induced Oxidative Stress", "abstract": "The study aimed to assess the effects of adding an alcoholic extract of Eruca sativa seeds and lead acetate to drinking water on the productive and physiological performance of broiler chickens.

Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) offers a non-invasive mechanism to capture detailed spatial and spectral information, enabling the discrimination of different types of contaminants from poultry muscle and non-muscle external tissues. When integrated with advanced deep learning (DL) models, HSI systems can achieve high accuracy in detecting foreign materials. However, the high dimensionality of HSI data, the computational complexity of DL models, and the high-paced nature of poultry processing environments pose challenges for real-time implementation in industrial settings, where the speed of imaging and decision-making is critical. In this study, we address these challenges by optimizing DL inference for HSI-based foreign material detection through a combination of post-training quantization and hardware acceleration techniques. We leveraged hardware acceleration utilizing the TensorRT module for NVIDIA GPU to enhance inference speed. Additionally, we applied half-precision (called FP16) post-training quantization to reduce the precision of model parameters, decreasing memory usage and computational requirements without any loss in model accuracy. We conducted simulations using two hypothetical hyperspectral line-scan cameras to evaluate the feasibility of real-time detection in industrial conditions. The simulation results demonstrated that our optimized models could achieve inference times compatible with the line speeds of poultry processing lines between 140 and 250 birds per minute, indicating the potential for real-time deployment. Specifically, the proposed inference method, optimized through hardware acceleration and model compression, achieved reductions in inference time of up to five times compared to unoptimized, traditional GPU-based inference. In addition, it resulted in a 50% decrease in model size while maintaining high detection accuracy that was also comparable to the original model.

Over the last 15 years, more attention has been paid to natural colorants because of the rising demand for clean-label food products. Anthocyanins, which are a group of phytochemicals responsible for the purple, blue or red hues of many plants, offer a market advantage. In addition, anthocyanin-rich foods are associated with protection against cardiovascular disease, thrombosis, diabetes, cancer, microbial-based disorders, neurological disorders, and vision ailments. However, the real health value of anthocyanins, whether as a natural colorant or a functional ingredient, is dependent on the ultimate bioaccessibility and bioavailability in the human body. Many animal and human clinical studies revealed that, after intake of anthocyanin-rich foods or anthocyanin extracts, only trace amounts (<\u00a01% of ingested content) of anthocyanins or their predicted metabolites were detected in plasma after a standard blood draw, which was indicative of low bioavailability of anthocyanins. Protein binding to anthocyanins is a strategy that has recently been reported to enhance the ultimate bioactivity, bioaccessibility, and bioavailability of anthocyanins as compared to anthocyanins delivered without a protein carrier. Therefore, in this review, we address anthocyanin properties in food processing and digestion, anthocyanin-protein complexes used in food matrices, and changes in the bioaccessibility and bioavailability of anthocyanins when bound into anthocyanin-protein complexes in foods.

Whey was utilized as a water substitute in the formulation of the beverage prior to fermentation, and five distinct formulations were developed based on the type and proportion of whey (0% whey (control sample), 25% acid whey, 100% acid whey, 25% sweet whey, 100% sweet whey). Microbiological, sensorial, phytochemical, and physicochemical analyses were performed on samples taken during fermentation and on samples fermented and then resting. The addition of whey into the formulation resulted in an increase in acidity and turbidity of the beverage, with lower anthocyanin content observed in samples containing whey compared to the control throughout the fermentation process. The samples containing 100% whey exhibited lower a*, b*, h, and C* values and lower amounts of individual anthocyanins. The microbial load in these samples was high in the early stages of fermentation and reached a minimum towards the end of fermentation. The incorporation of whey led to an acceleration in the fermentation process, an enhancement in the microbiological characteristics of the beverage, and a substantial variation in phenolic compounds through the formation of a reversible protein complex. The resting process provided significant increases in color, anthocyanins, and gentisic and chlorogenic acids of whey-containing samples. The results showed that it is possible to produce whey-based functional fermented black carrot juice that is close to the control sample in terms of sensory and phytochemical properties and better than the control sample in terms of lactic acid bacteria count.

Undoubtedly, one of the most interesting bacteria exhibiting plant-stimulating traits is, more widely known as a pathogen, Bacillus cereus. To date, several environmentally safe strains of B. cereus have been isolated and described, including B. cereus WSE01, MEN8, YL6, SA1, ALT1, ERBP, GGBSTD1, AK1, AR156, C1L, and T4S. These strains have been studied under growth chamber, greenhouse, and field conditions and have shown many significant traits, including indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) deaminase production or phosphate solubilization, which allows direct plant growth promotion. It includes an increase in biometrics traits, chemical element content (e.g., N, P, and K), and biologically active substances content or activity, e.g., antioxidant enzymes and total soluble sugar. Hence, B. cereus has supported the growth of plant species such as soybean, maize, rice, and wheat. Importantly, some B. cereus strains can also promote plant growth under abiotic stresses, including drought, salinity, and heavy metal pollution. In addition, B. cereus strains produced extracellular enzymes and antibiotic lipopeptides or triggered induced systemic resistance, which allows indirect stimulation of plant growth. As far as biocontrol is concerned, these PGPB can suppress the development of agriculturally important phytopathogens, including bacterial phytopathogens (e.g., Pseudomonas syringae, Pectobacterium carotovorum, and Ralstonia solanacearum), fungal phytopathogens (e.g., Fusarium oxysporum, Botrytis cinerea, and Rhizoctonia solani), and other phytopathogenic organisms (e.g., Meloidogyne incognita (Nematoda) and Plasmodiophora brassicae (Protozoa)). In conclusion, it should be noted that there are still few studies on the effectiveness of B. cereus under field conditions, particularly, there is a lack of comprehensive analyses comparing the PGP effects of B. cereus and mineral fertilizers, which should be reduced in favor of decreasing the use of mineral fertilizers. It is also worth mentioning that there are still very few studies on the impact of B. cereus on the indigenous microbiota and its persistence after application to soil.

This review sought to answer what technologies and inventions could be used to achieve zero greenhouse gas emissions through efficient energy-saving mechanisms while considering their technical and economic viability. The synthesis of the findings led to several themes which included energy-saving techniques for greenhouses, systems that reduced unfavorable external conditions and renewable energy systems. Other themes identified regarded energy storage systems, systems for managing conditions in greenhouses, carbon capture and storage, and factors influencing the performance of different technologies to enhance resource management and ensure zero carbon emissions. The findings also revealed various technologies used in the design of energy-saving techniques in greenhouses including proportional\u2013integral\u2013derivatives (PID), fuzzy, artificial neural networks, and other intelligent algorithms. Additionally, technologies that were a combination of these algorithms were also examined. The systems that reduced unfavorable external conditions included the use of insulation panels and intelligent shading systems. Greenhouse covers were also optimized by smart glass systems, sensors, Internet of Things (IoT), and Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. Renewable energy systems included PV (solar) panels, wind turbines, and geothermal electricity. Some of the thermal energy storage systems widely studied in recent research included underground thermal energy storage (UTES) (for seasonal storage), phase-change materials (PCMs), and water tanks, which are used to address short-term shortages and peak loads.

Gamma\u2010aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a neurotransmitter naturally produced from glutamate by the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase. Age\u2010related decline in GABA is linked to age\u2010related motor and sensory decline and seems to affect sarcopenia, yet no detailed study has been conducted. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of GABA on improving sarcopenia by suppressing muscle protein degradation through supplementing decreased GABA in old mice. Methods GABA (10 or 30\u2009mg/kg/day) was orally administered daily to young (3\u2009months) and old (21\u201323\u2009months) C57BL/6 mice for 7\u2009weeks. The body weight and grip strength of the mice were measured weekly at the same time. After sacrificing the mice, the quadriceps and gastrocnemius muscles were excised from their hind limbs, and the spleen and serum were collected. Histological, biochemical and molecular analyses were conducted in various experiments. Results The administration of GABA increased muscle strength (+41%, +70% compared to the aged mouse control group, GABA at doses of 10 or 30\u2009mg/kg/day respectively, p\u2009<\u20090.05) and muscle mass (quadriceps: +28%, +46%; gastrocnemius: +12%, +19%, p\u2009<\u20090.05) in old mice. This increase was accompanied by a cross\u2010sectional area (CSA) increase in the quadriceps and gastrocnemius muscle (p\u2009<\u20090.05). The administration of GABA increased IGF\u20101 levels in serum (p\u2009<\u20090.05), leading to the activation of muscle protein synthesis. We found that GABA inhibits sarcopenia by regulating muscle protein degradation through the activation of Akt/mTOR/FoxO3a signalling pathways. GABA also regulates inflammaging, which is a hallmark of age\u2010related muscle atrophy. There was a significant increase in the F4/80\u2009+\u2009CD11b\u2009+\u2009total macrophage ratio in gastrocnemius and spleen, especially the M1 macrophage ratio increased in old mice. However, GABA administration was effective in suppressing M1 macrophages (gastrocnemius: \u221240%, \u2212 53%; spleen: \u221222%, \u221226%, p\u2009<\u20090.05).

It is primarily produced by the irreversible action of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) on the \u03b1-decarboxylation of L-glutamic acid. As a major neurotransmitter in the brain, GABA plays a crucial role in behavior, cognition, and the body\u2019s stress response. GABA is mainly synthesized through the GABA shunt and the polyamine degradation pathways. It works through three receptors (GABAA, GABAB, and GABAC), each exhibiting different pharmacological and physiological characteristics. GABA has a variety of physiological roles and applications. In plants, it regulates growth, development and stress responses. In mammals, it influences physiological functions such as nervous system regulation, blood pressure equilibrium, liver and kidneys enhancement, hormone secretion regulation, immunity enhancement, cancer prevention, as well as anti-aging effects. As a biologically active ingredient, GABA possesses unique physiological effects and medicinal value, leading to its widespread application and substantially increased market demand in the food and pharmaceutical industries. GABA is primarily produced through chemical synthesis, plant enrichment and microbial fermentation. In this review, we first make an overview of GABA, focusing on its synthesis, metabolism, GABA receptors and physiological functions. Next, we describe the industrial production methods of GABA. Finally, we discuss the development of ligands for the GABA receptor binding site, the prospects of GABA production and application, as well as its clinical trials in potential drugs or compounds targeting GABA for the treatment of epilepsy.

The formulation also aimed to promote the local action of the extract in the stomach. Methods: Tablets were obtained by direct compression of sodium bicarbonate (7.5%) and solid lipid microparticles (92.5%), which were obtained with lyophilizing double emulsions. A quality by design (QbD) was employed to evaluate the impact of formulation factors and processing parameters on emulsion viscosity, powder characteristics (moisture content, encapsulation efficiency, flowability), and tablet characteristics (floating lag time, gentiopicroside release, and assessment of dispersibility during in vitro dissolution). Results: The trehalose content and high-shear-homogenization (HSH) time of primary emulsion were critical factors. Trehalose content positively influenced emulsion viscosity, moisture content, floating lag time, encapsulation efficiency, and the release rate of gentiopicroside. HSH time positively affected powder stability and negatively gentiopicroside release. The selected powder had a high gentiopicroside encapsulation efficiency (95.13%), optimal stability, and good flowability. The developed tablets exhibited adequate floating lag time (275 s), mucoadhesive properties, and gentiopicroside biphasic release (29.04% in 45 min; 67.95% in 6 h). Furthermore, the optimal tablet formulation remained stable for 18 months and was primarily digested by duodenal enzymes.

Plants employ many signaling pathways to respond to water stress by modifying their growth patterns, activating antioxidants, accumulating suitable solutes and chaperones, and making stress proteins. These physiological, metabolic, and genetic modifications can be employed as the best indicators for choosing drought-tolerant genotypes. The main objective of sweet potato breeding in many regions of the world, especially those affected by drought, is to obtain varieties that combine drought tolerance with high yields. In this regard, the study of the physiological and biochemical features of certain varieties is important for the implementation of drought resistance measures. Adapted genotypes can be selected and improved for particular growing conditions by using suitable tools and drought tolerance-related selection criteria. By regulating genetics in this way, the creation of drought-resistant varieties may become cost-effective for smallholder farmers.

Here, we advocate for the use of soil microbiome interventions to help increase soil carbon stocks and curb greenhouse gas emissions from managed soils. Direct interventions include the introduction of microbial strains, consortia, phage, and soil transplants, whereas indirect interventions include managing soil conditions or additives to modulate community composition or its activities. Approaches to increase soil carbon stocks using microbially catalyzed processes include increasing carbon inputs from plants, promoting soil organic matter (SOM) formation, and reducing SOM turnover and production of diverse greenhouse gases. Marginal or degraded soils may provide the greatest opportunities for enhancing global soil carbon stocks. Among the many knowledge gaps in this field, crucial gaps include the processes influencing the transformation of plant-derived soil carbon inputs into SOM and the identity of the microbes and microbial activities impacting this transformation.

Human exposure to microplastics has been confirmed by their presence in multiple tissues. Terrestrial domestic animals may be relevant to human exposure, as they are also subjected to the same environmental contaminants, possibly acting as sentinels (i.e., help estimate exposure and risk to humans) or by being an integral part of the human food chain, as in the case of livestock. This work addresses how microplastics may impact terrestrial domestic animals, leading to consequences for food security (i.e., the availability of food) and food safety (i.e., the prevention of foodborne illnesses) and how companion animals may help estimate environmental human exposure. Abstract Terrestrial domestic animals are exposed to microplastics, therefore, contaminating the food chain, in the case of livestock, or acting as sentinels for human exposure, in the case of companion animals. The aim of this review was to address the importance of terrestrial domestic animals on human exposure to microplastics. Animal products may already show some microplastics contamination, which may occur during their lifetime, possibly also compromising productivity, and during processing, originating from equipment and packaging. Moreover, release of microplastics in animal feces (or manure) leads to the contamination of agricultural fields, with possible impacts and internalization in plants. Therefore, microplastics pose a threat to food security, compromising food productivity, and food safety, by being a foreign material found in animal products. Conversely, in urban environments, companion animals (cats and dogs) may be relevant sentinels for human exposure. While oral exposure may vary in pets compared to humans, due to indiscriminate ingestion and chewing or licking behaviors, airborne exposure is likely to be a good indicator for human exposure. Therefore, future studies should address the importance of terrestrial domestic animals for human exposure of microplastics, both in the food chain and as sentinels for environmental exposure.", "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-02-01", "synthetic_support_claim": "Microplastics contaminate terrestrial domestic animals, compromising food security and safety, and act as human exposure sentinels.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Microplastics exposure in terrestrial domestic animals directly correlates with a decrease in human health outcomes."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "8bed57cd8de8737be434f035100bd617333f888a", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8bed57cd8de8737be434f035100bd617333f888a", "title": "Presence of Microplastics in Water, Soil, Organic Fertilizer, and Potato Plants on Potato Plantations", "abstract": "Microplastics (MPs) have become a significant environmental concern, but data on their presence in potato gardens are limited.

Patulin is a mycotoxin produced mainly by the fungal genera Penicillium, Aspergillus, and Byssochlamys. Alternaria toxins, produced by fungi in the Alternaria genus, are another common group of mycotoxins found in fruits and fruit products. The most prevalent Alternaria toxins are alternariol (AOH) and alternariol monomethyl ether (AME). These mycotoxins are of concern due to their potential negative effects on human health. Ingesting fruits contaminated with these mycotoxins can cause acute and chronic health problems. Detection of patulin and Alternaria toxins in fruit and their derived products can be challenging due to their low concentrations and the complexity of the food matrices. Common analytical methods, good agricultural practices, and contamination monitoring of these mycotoxins are important for safe consumption of fruits and derived products.

Methods Twenty-one male Hu sheep with similar body weights (32.68 \u00b1 1.59 kg) were randomly assigned to three groups: a control group (CON) receiving a TMR with soybean straw, a rice husk powder group (RH), and a fermented rice husk powder group (FHR). Results The results indicated that the FHR group exhibited a significant increase in ADG and FBW of Hu sheep compared to the other two groups (p\u2009< 0.05). The digestibility of CP and EE was significantly higher in the CON and FHR groups than in the RH group (p\u2009< 0.01). Furthermore, the digestibility of DM in the CON group was higher than in the FHR and RH groups (p\u2009< 0.01). The FHR group showed lower NDF and ADF digestibility compared to the CON group, but higher than the RH group (p\u2009< 0.05). Additionally, serum ALB and ALT levels in the CON group were elevated compared to those in the two groups (p\u2009< 0.05). The rumen concentrations of TVFA, butyrate, and valerate in the FHR group were significantly elevated compared to the other two groups (p\u2009< 0.05). At the genus level, the relative abundances of Rikenellaceae RC9 gut group, Succinimonas, UCG-010_norank, UCG-005, p-251-o5_norank, and Lachnospiraceae AC2044 group were significantly diminished in the FHR group compared to the CON group (p\u2009< 0.05).

The consumption of refined wheat bread has raised concerns among health\u2010conscious consumers. This has partly stimulated research interest in the inclusion of functional ingredients such as germinated/fermented legume flour in the development of nutritious and healthy breads to drive innovations in the bakery industry and overcome sustainability problems. Nevertheless, the inclusion of germinated/fermented legume flours cannot be a direct replacement of refined wheat, because processing requirements must be met. This critical review analyzes the impact of germinated/fermented legume flour on the rheological characteristics, nutritional quality, health\u2010promoting, and technological properties of wheat\u2010based bread for improved nutrition and health, identifying current challenges. The macroconstituent changes and the increasing enzyme activity produced during germination/fermentation influence the functionality of wheat dough and the resultant bread quality. Substitution of up to 20% germinated legume flour caused detrimental effects on technological properties of the bread, whereas better technological properties were recorded with up to 20% fermented legume flour. Nevertheless, more studies are needed to provide detailed insight on this observation. Germinated/fermented legume flour could serve as a functional ingredient for the development of nutritious and healthy breads. In fact, breads containing germinated/legume flour are rich in quality protein, dietary fiber, micronutrients, phytochemicals, and bioactive constituents and low in glycemic index with improved sensory properties compared to 100% wheat bread.

The potential desirable characteristics of the LAB as a probiotic have necessitated the screening of various fermentative compounds to identify a good source of LAB for probiotic use. This was designed to evaluate the probiotic activities of 10 Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) strains previously isolated from Cassava and Ogi effluents. Probiotic activities, including pH, titratable acidity, bile salt tolerance, and safety (DNase, hemolysis, and antibacterial activity) were examined using standard laboratory techniques. The pH and total titratable acidity (TTA) of last stage effluents samples generated during Ogi, and Cassava fufu production revealed that the pH of the samples ranges from 3.1 to 5.3 and the TTA ranges from 0.21 to 0.26 %. The pH and TTA of the samples clearly showed that they were acidic. It revealed that the maximum optical density values at 0.2% and 0.3% bile tolerance were 2.40\u00b10.75 and 3.62\u00b10.11 for LAB 9. All the isolates showed appropriate growth in the presence of bile and acid tolerance pH3-pH7. The safety evaluation of the LAB strains revealed negative hemolysis (Gamma hemolysis) and negative DNase activity. Results of antibacterial activity indicate that the LAB strains from Ogi and Cassava last stage effluent samples were found to inhibit the growth of most of the pathogenic clinical strains of S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and B. subtilis with the highest inhibition zones exhibited from the LAB strains was 23 mm. LAB1, LAB 2, LAB 3, LAB5, LAB6, LAB9, and LAB10 showed no inhibition activity against E. coli.

Some of them are not environmentally friendly. In this regard, it is crucial to develop long-term solutions that boost saline soil productivity while also protecting the ecosystem. Organic amendments, such as vermicompost (VC), vermiwash (VW), biochar (BC), bio-fertilizer (BF), and plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are gaining attention in research. The organic amendment reduces salt stress and improves crops growth, development and yield.

This study evaluates the effects of organic amendments and moisture conditions on the vegetative growth and yield of rice varieties in a saline field in the Khulna district of Bangladesh. The field experiment was conducted from February to May 2020, using rice straw compost (RSC), sawdust (SD), rice husk (RH), and mustard seed meal (MSM) at varying rates (0, 5, 10, 15 t ha-1) under moist (70% soil moisture) and saturated (>100% soil moisture) conditions. The experiment featured BRRI dhan 28 (salt-sensitive) and BRRI dhan 47 (salt-tolerant) varieties. Key metrics evaluated in the study included the productive to unproductive tillers ratio (PTR), spikelet sterility, percent filled grains, straw yield, and grain yield. Results indicated significant (p \u22640.05) improvements in PTR, reduction in spikelet sterility, increased grain filling, and higher straw and grain yields with applying organic amendments, especially MSM. The highest PTR for BRRI dhan 47 (0.86) was achieved with MSM at 5 t ha-1 under moist conditions, while BRRI dhan 28 reached a PTR of 0.81 with RH at 10 t ha-1 under saturated conditions. Spikelet sterility was minimized (9/panicle) with MSM at 5 t ha-1 under saturated conditions for both varieties. Percent filled grains peaked (88.9%) with MSM at 5 t ha-1 for BRRI dhan 28. Enhanced straw yields were observed, with BRRI dhan 47 achieving 8.76 t ha-1 with MSM at 10 t ha-1. Grain yield increased significantly, with BRRI dhan 28 yielding 5.75 t ha-1 under similar conditions.

Brown algae are a source of active biomolecules and minerals that are currently used as agricultural biostimulants, since they increase crop productivity. This type of biostimulants derived from brown algae improve seed germination, increase the accumulation of plant biomass by accelerating cell division and elongation, activating the antioxidant system of plants, making them more resistant to stress, and contributes to the absorption and translocation of nutrients present in the soil. These products are also compatible with other agricultural inputs, such as synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, which makes them ideal for comprehensive applications and maintaining a balance in agroecosystems.

As starter cultures, probiotics, and bacteriocin producers, LAB contributes to the production of high-quality foods and beverages that meet the growing consumer demand for minimally processed functional and health-promoting food products. Industrial food processing, especially in the fresh produce and beverage sector, is shifting to the use of more natural bioproducts in food production, prioritizing not only preservation but also the enhancement of functional characteristics in the final product. Starter cultures, essential to this approach, are carefully selected for their robust adaptation to the food environment. These cultures, often combined with probiotics, contribute beyond their basic fermentation roles by improving the safety, nutritional value, and health-promoting properties of foods. Thus, their selection is critical in preserving the integrity, quality, and nutrition of foods, especially in fresh produce and fruits and vegetable beverages, which have a dynamic microbiome. In addition to reducing the risk of foodborne illnesses and spoilage through the metabolites, including bacteriocins they produce, the use of LAB in these products can contribute essential amino acids, lactic acids, and other bioproducts that directly impact food quality.

The strong structure of wool and its indigestibility are the main hurdles to achieving its potential as an edible protein. Although various methods have been investigated for the hydrolysis of wool into keratin, only a few of these, such as sulfitolysis, oxidation, and enzymatic processes, have the potential to generate edible keratin.

Weighted linear regression and restricted cubic spline (RCS) were used to explore the correlation between dietary flavonoid intake and cardiovascular health (Life\u2019s Essential 8 (LE8) score) in cancer survivors. Then, weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression and quantile-based g-computation (qgcomp) models were performed to assess the mixed effects of the six flavonoid subclasses and to determine the major flavonoid types. Additionally, the protective effect of high flavonoid intake on cardiovascular health was further evaluated in different subgroups, and mediation analysis was used to explore mediating factors. Results After adjusting for all covariates, compared to those in the first quartile, participants in the fourth quartile of total flavonoids, anthocyanidins, flavonols, flavanones, and flavones intake exhibited increases in LE8 scores of 3.24% (95% CI: 0.45\u20136.03, P for trend=0.030), 6.25% (95% CI: 3.14\u20139.36, P for trend<0.001), 3.01% (95% CI: 1.33\u20134.69, P for trend= 0.003), 3.23% (95% CI: 0.18\u20136.27, P for trend=0.030), and 5.01% (95% CI: 2.42\u20137.61, P for trend<0.001), respectively.

The phage demonstrated favorable characteristics for potential therapeutic applications, including a short latent period of 30 minutes and a large burst size of 136 plaque-forming units (PFU) per cell. KG853 exhibited stability across various temperatures and pH values, indicating its robustness under various environmental conditions. Genomic analysis showed that KG853 possesses a circular DNA genome of 45,390 base pairs with a GC content of 52.2%. No lysogenic or virulence genes were detected among the 84 open reading frames annotated in the genome, suggesting its safety for potential therapeutic use. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that phage KG853 is closely related to phage PaP3. Notably, KG853 demonstrated the ability to inhibit the formation of 4-hour biofilms by P. aeruginosa, a critical virulence factor in many infections. Host range analysis showed that KG853 is specific to P. aeruginosa, an important characteristic for targeted therapy. These findings suggest that bacteriophage KG853 represents a promising candidate for combating drug-resistant P. aeruginosa infections.

The major fruit-producing countries (United States, China, India, and Brazil) are responsible for a large portion of this waste. Fruit waste contains different bioactive compounds like polyphenols, flavonoids, vitamins, and carotenoids, which are, in large part, underutilized regardless of their antioxidant properties. These compounds can play an important function in poultry nutrition, offering natural alternatives to synthetic antioxidants. Reintegrating fruit waste into poultry diets might have potent benefits on the nutritional quality and shelf life of eggs. Some studies reported that bioactive compounds from fruit waste improve the oxidative stability of eggs and the nutritional content, potentially extending shelf life during storage. Additionally, antioxidant compounds from fruit waste have been shown to improve yolk coloration and some egg quality parameters while reducing reactive oxygen species, which cause lipid oxidation. Their inclusion in poultry diets can lower feed costs, promote animal welfare, and reduce the environmental impact of fruit waste. This review highlights some key fruit wastes, such as citrus, apple, grape, rosehip, sea buckthorn, and banana, among others, which are natural reservoirs of bioactive compounds beneficial for poultry nutrition.

To address this issue, researchers have repeatedly underlined the need for greater emphasis on the development and promotion of energy efficient, and environmentally sound novel fertilizers, in addition to improved agronomic management to augment nutrient use efficiency for restoring soil fertility and increasing farm profit. Hence, a fixed plot field experiment was conducted to assess the economic and environmental competency of conventional fertilizers with and without nano-urea (novel fertilizer) in two predominant cropping systems viz., maize-wheat and pearl millet-mustard under semi-arid regions of India. Result indicates that the supply of 75% recommended N with conventional fertilizer along with nano-urea spray (N75PK+nano-urea) reduced the energy requirement by ~8\u201311% and increased energy use efficiency by ~6\u20139% over 100% nitrogen through prilled urea fertilizer (business as usual). Furthermore, the application of N75PK+ nano-urea exhibited ~14% higher economic yields in all the crops compared with N50PK+ nano-urea. Application of N75PK+nano-urea registered comparable soil N and dehydrogenase activities (35.8 \u03bcg TPF g-1 24 hrs-1 across all crops) over the conventional fertilization (N100PK). This indicates that application of foliar spray of nano-urea with 75% N is a soil supportive production approach. More interestingly, two foliar sprays of nano-urea curtailed nitrogen load by 25% without any yield penalty, besides reducing the greenhouse gases (GHG) emission from 164.2 to 416.5 kg CO2-eq ha-1 under different crops.

The use of nano fertilizers in conjunction with a reduced dose of traditional fertilizers improves nutrient availability to plants and minimizes leaching and environmental contamination. The impact of the application of such an integrated fertilization approach on the soil fertility and microbiological population also needs to be understood. The present study investigates the influence of seven field treatments, including biogenic urea nanoparticles, as a source of N nutrient developed by TERI (referred as Teri's nano urea [TNU]), with and without conventional urea in an integrated manner. These treatments include the following: (T1)\u2014100% recommended dose of nitrogen (RDN), (T2)\u2014TNU alone, (T3) 100% RDN combined with TNU, (T4)\u2014TNU at 50% concentration alone, (T5)\u201475% RDN combined with TNU, (T6) 50% RDN combined with TNU, and (T7) 50% RDN alone.

The study also incorporates the economics of using nanoparticles to supplement nitrogen in an additive manner along with non\u2010nano macronutrient sources. Further, the influence of this novel approach of fertilization was also evaluated on the native microorganism species found in the rice fields.

Results indicate non-flat adsorption orientations, with pomegranate peel extract components showing superior inhibition capabilities, attributed to the formation of strong O-H chemical bonds with the TiO2 surface. In the experimental part of the study Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) and Potentiodynamic Polarization (PDP) were conducted. Two electrolytes were tested: a solution 3.5% NaCl and a solution 0.5 M NaOH. All the tests were performed with 5% of inhibitor and with the reference solution. Also, inhibition efficiency was calculated on the base of PDP tests. The study found that pomegranate extract can act as a good corrosion inhibitor for titanium alloy in aqueous solutions 0.5 M NaOH. This was demonstrated by the increase in the corrosion potential and impedance modulus and decrease in the corrosion current density after the addition of pomegranate extract to the solution. However, in a 3.5% NaCl solution, the efficacy of pomegranate extract was less pronounced, probably due to the high aggressivity of the electrolyte.

Key barriers included food neophobia and cultural resistance. The findings revealed a significant gap between awareness and behaviour: while 86% recognised insects as nutritious and 58% associated them with sustainability, only 18.6% have tried consuming them. This is a notable larger disparity compared to the adoption of other sustainable alternatives, such as vegetable meat based on peas, which have seen broader acceptance in recent years. Additionally, although 93.2% found products more appealing when their natural appearance is hidden, traditional insect-free products were still rated higher in taste, sweetness, and texture. Some insect-based products such as protein bars showed potential for greater acceptance than others. Bridging the awareness-behaviour gap requires targeted education, sensory improvement, and strategic marketing to emphasise nutritional and environmental benefits. Chefs could play a vital role by designing innovative menus that incorporate these products in familiar forms. This is demonstrated by successful examples where chefs have normalised unconventional ingredients, such as seaweed, overcoming cultural barriers and enhancing acceptance.

Potential energy surfaces (PESs) and Gibbs free energy surfaces (GFESs) were calculated for the pathways from four BH3 adducts (located at the AB, CC, D, and E sites) on the C70 to eight products formed by the 1,2-addition of BH3 across the four [6,6]-ring fused bonds (AB, CC, DE, and EE) and across the two [5,6]-ring fused bonds (AA and DD). These pathways are two-step consecutive reactions. We denoted the positions on the fullerene cage as A through E, from the pole to the equator, based on the D5h symmetry of the C70 fullerene. In the first step reaction, the product ratios for the four adduct intermediates should be as the primary intermediate BH3(D), the secondary intermediate BH3(AB), the tertiary intermediate BH3(CC), and the minor intermediate BH3(E), based on the Fukui indices. In addition, in the second step reaction, transition states (TSs) from four adduct intermediates to eight product isomers, namely, BH2(A)H (B) to BH2(E)H (E), were obtained using the QST2 method. The calculated reaction coordinates showed exothermic reactions for all bonds except the EE bond. We also confirmed the transition states by frequency calculations and intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) analyses. The PESs and GFESs suggest spontaneous processes for the four isomers, of which the primary products are BH2(A)H (B) and its isomer BH2(B)H (A), the secondary product is BH2(C)H (C), and the tertiary product is BH2(D)H (D), all formed through adduct intermediates. Therefore, through the hydroboration reaction of C70, we could predict and design the site selectivity of C70 by controlling the energy barrier of the transition state in the second step of the reaction. This implies that we could selectively synthesize mainly BH2(B)H (A) isomers across the AB-[6,6]-ring fused bond and also design BH2(D)H(D) isomers across the DD-[5,6]-ring fused bond.

Addressing these challenges demands the development of innovative technologies that can increase food production, reduce environmental impacts, and bolster the resilience of agroecosystems against climate variation. Nanotechnology, particularly the application of nanoparticles (NPs), represents an innovative approach to strengthen crop resilience and enhance the sustainability of agriculture. NPs have special physicochemical properties, including a high surface-area-to-volume ratio and the ability to penetrate plant tissues, which enhances nutrient uptake, stress resistance, and photosynthetic efficiency. This review paper explores how abiotic stressors impact crops and the role of NPs in bolstering crop resistance to these challenges. The main emphasis is on the potential of NPs potential to boost plant stress tolerance by triggering the plant defense mechanisms, improving growth under stress, and increasing agricultural yield. NPs have demonstrated potential in addressing key agricultural challenges, such as nutrient leaching, declining soil fertility, and reduced crop yield due to poor water management. However, applying NPs must consider regulatory and environmental concerns, including soil accumulation, toxicity to non-target organisms, and consumer perceptions of NP-enhanced products. To mitigate land and water impacts, NPs should be integrated with precision agriculture technologies, allowing targeted application of nano-fertilizers and nano-pesticides.

Methods: Twelve healthy subjects of both sexes, aged 18\u201365 years, participated in this study. Each person consumed two standardized portions of chickpea pasta: (i) freshly cooked (FCP) and (ii) cooked chickpea pasta which was cooled for 24 h at 4 \u00b0C and reheated before consumption (CCP).

In order to assess the development, growth, feed conversion efficiency, and chemical composition of Zophobas morio (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) larvae fed with diets containing poultry litter, an experiment was conducted. Five diets with varying levels of poultry litter inclusion (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100%) were used to replace the control diet (broiler feed), with five replicates containing 25 larvae per sample unit. Larval growth and development were assessed, and the chemical compositions of both the diet and Z. morio larvae were determined. Significant differences were observed among treatments for development time, survival rate, pupa weight, adult weight of Z. morio subjected to different poultry litter-based diets, as well as in the nutritional index bioassay. The longest development time and the highest larval mortality were observed in the 100% poultry litter-based diets. The highest percentage of crude protein in larval meal (%CP) was obtained with the addition of 25 and 50% poultry litter and was lowest with 100%. The incorporation of poultry litter into the diet of Z. morio has a multifaceted impact on growth and feed conversion efficiency.

Due to its richness in a variety of nutritional and bioactive ingredients, the consumption of pea has been suggested to be associated with a wide range of health benefits, and there has been increasing focus on its potential as a functional food. However, there have been limited literature reviews concerning the bioactive compounds, health-promoting effects, and potential applications of pea up to now. This review, therefore, summarizes the literature from the last ten years regarding the chemical composition, physicochemical properties, processing, health benefits, and potential applications of pea. Whole peas are rich in macronutrients, including proteins, starches, dietary fiber, and non-starch polysaccharides. In addition, polyphenols, especially flavonoids and phenolic acids, are important bioactive ingredients that are mainly distributed in the pea coats. Anti-nutritional factors, such as phytic acid, lectin, and trypsin inhibitors, may hinder nutrient absorption. Whole pea seeds can be processed by different techniques such as drying, milling, soaking, and cooking to improve their functional properties. In addition, physicochemical and functional properties of pea starches and pea proteins can be improved by chemical, physical, enzymatic, and combined modification methods. Owing to the multiple bioactive ingredients in peas, the pea and its products exhibit various health benefits, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, anti-renal fibrosis, and regulation of metabolic syndrome effects. Peas have been processed into various products such as pea beverages, germinated pea products, pea flour-incorporated products, pea-based meat alternatives, and encapsulation and packing materials. Furthermore, recommendations are also provided on how to better utilize peas to promote their development as a sustainable and functional grain.

In this respect, to ensure sufficient and balanced nutrition of existing animals, there is a need to increase the cultivation areas of fodder crops and proper management of pastures and breeding studies. For this reason, fodder pea (Pisum sativum L.), which has high nutritional value and is preferred for animal consumption, is a vital fodder plant to meet this need. Fodder peas are suitable for consumption as animal feed because they contain high levels of carbohydrates and digestible substances. However, salinity, one of the abiotic stress factors, is an essential problem for fodder peas. Salinity significantly limits the development of the plant and leads to yield losses. Although the consequences of climate change vary in many parts of the world, it is predicted that the frequency and severity of conditions such as decreased precipitation, increased temperatures, floods, droughts, and increased saline areas will increase with climate change in developing countries. In addition, salt stress also affects the photosynthetic mechanism in plants and causes changes in chlorophyll, carotenoid, phenolic, and antioxidant concentrations. Since the reclamation of saline farmland is expensive and complex, it is more appropriate to grow salinity-resistant plants. Therefore, gene studies to improve the salinity tolerance of plants have gained momentum in recent years. In this review, studies conducted in the last 20 years are discussed. Salt tolerance in gene-transferred and non-transferred peas, as well as plant growth in a saline environment, were assessed by comparing proline, chlorophyll, total phenolic, and antioxidant levels.

Moreover, these films are made from petroleum-based materials that degrade into microplastics, resulting in environmental contamination and potential health risks for humans. Herein, an antibacterial and antioxidant food packaging film (CS-SAP@R) is developed by integrating star-shaped amphiphilic polypeptides (SAP) and resveratrol (R) into the chitosan (CS) matrix. The incorporation of SAP not only effectively addresses the existing compatibility issues between the highly hydrophobic resveratrol and water-soluble CS film, but also significantly enhances the antimicrobial properties of CS.

The increasing impacts of climate change and environmental stressors like drought, salinity, and heavy metal (HM) toxicity threaten crop productivity worldwide. Addressing these challenges demands the development of innovative technologies that can increase food production, reduce environmental impacts, and bolster the resilience of agroecosystems against climate variation. Nanotechnology, particularly the application of nanoparticles (NPs), represents an innovative approach to strengthen crop resilience and enhance the sustainability of agriculture. NPs have special physicochemical properties, including a high surface-area-to-volume ratio and the ability to penetrate plant tissues, which enhances nutrient uptake, stress resistance, and photosynthetic efficiency. This review paper explores how abiotic stressors impact crops and the role of NPs in bolstering crop resistance to these challenges. The main emphasis is on the potential of NPs potential to boost plant stress tolerance by triggering the plant defense mechanisms, improving growth under stress, and increasing agricultural yield. NPs have demonstrated potential in addressing key agricultural challenges, such as nutrient leaching, declining soil fertility, and reduced crop yield due to poor water management.

Digital inclusive finance, which combines the advantages of digital technology and inclusive finance, represents a new scheme that can ease credit constraints and information ambiguity in agricultural production. First, this study focused on agro-ecological functions; we incorporated total agricultural carbon sequestration and emissions extraction into the evaluation system and used the mixed-direction-distance function to calculate agricultural green total factor productivity. Then, based on panel data from 31 provinces in China collected from 2011 to 2021, we used the two-way fixed effect model, the interactive fixed effect, and the plausibly exogenous variable method to test the impact of digital financial inclusion on agricultural green total factor productivity, and its mechanism of action.

Using the HMB index method, we calculate and decompose China\u2019s inter-provincial ATFP from 2011 to 2020. Employing the dynamic panel fixed effect model and SYS-GMM method, we empirically test the influence of DIF on agricultural productivity in relation to farmland transfer.Our findings reveal a slow upward trend in China\u2019s ATFP, driven primarily by scale efficiency. Notably, a 1% increase in the general index of DIF correlates with a 0.136% increase in ATFP. We analyze the sub-classification indexes of digital inclusive finance, namely coverage breadth, depth of use, and digitalization degree. Their contributions to agricultural productivity growth are significant, with coverage breadth having the greatest impact, followed by depth of use and digitalization degree. Farmland transfer acts as a crucial intermediary, enhancing agricultural allocation efficiency and driving the relationship between digital finance and total factor productivity growth. Interestingly, the western region exhibits the highest growth rates, followed by the eastern region, while the central region shows no significant effects.To comprehensively enhance ATFP, aligning supply and demand for digital financial services, leveraging service depth, and guiding farmland transfer according to local conditions are essential.

To evaluate these emissions, there is a need to use reliable methods. Enteric methane (CH4) and other greenhouse gas emissions from ruminants can be mitigated in numerous ways. The objectives of this review were to examine currently available knowledge about methane evaluation and mitigation strategies, and food supplements. We wanted to present a critical view and raise visions of what is known and unknown about GHG reduction and control. Abstract Agriculture produces greenhouse gases. Methane is a result of manure degradation and microbial fermentation in the rumen. Reduced CH4 emissions will slow climate change and reduce greenhouse gas concentrations. This review compiled studies to evaluate the best ways to decrease methane emissions. Longer rumination times reduce methane emissions and milk methane. Other studies have not found this. Increasing propionate and reducing acetate and butyrate in the rumen can reduce hydrogen equivalents that would otherwise be transferred to methanogenesis. Diet can reduce methane emissions. Grain lowers rumen pH, increases propionate production, and decreases CH4 yield. Methane generation per unit of energy-corrected milk yield reduces with a higher-energy diet. Bioactive bromoform discovered in the red seaweed Asparagopsis taxiformis reduces livestock intestinal methane output by inhibiting its production. Essential oils, tannins, saponins, and flavonoids are anti-methanogenic. While it is true that plant extracts can assist in reducing methane emissions, it is crucial to remember to source and produce plants in a sustainable manner. Minimal lipid supplementation can reduce methane output by 20%, increasing energy density and animal productivity. Selecting low- CH4 cows may lower GHG emissions. These findings can lead to additional research to completely understand the impacts of methanogenesis suppression on rumen fermentation and post-absorptive metabolism, which could improve animal productivity and efficiency.", "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-10-01", "synthetic_support_claim": "Bioactive bromoform in the red seaweed Asparagopsis taxiformis reduces livestock intestinal methane output by inhibiting production.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Global adoption of plant-based diets is necessary to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from livestock and dairy farms."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "60d9e29beffdf4a718c5ce35c77aaa2d645222c3", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/60d9e29beffdf4a718c5ce35c77aaa2d645222c3", "title": "Mapping Methane - The Impact of Dairy Farm Practices on Emissions Through Satellite Data and Machine Learning", "abstract": "Methane emissions from dairy farms are a significant driver of climate change, yet their relationship with farm-specific practices remains poorly understood.

Moreover, the morphological and topographical structures of MOSs have significantly influenced the gas sensors by means of surface catalytic activities. This work examines the impact of morphological and topological networked assembly of zinc oxide (ZnO) nanostructures, including microparticles and nanoparticles (0D), nanowires and nanorods (1D), nanodisks (2D), and hierarchical networks of tetrapods (3D). Gas sensors consisting of vertically aligned ZnO nanorods (ZnO\u2013NR) and topologically interconnected tetrapods (T\u2013ZnO) of varying diameter and arm thickness synthesized using aqueous phase deposition and flame transport method on interdigitated Pt electrodes are evaluated for methane detection. Smaller-diameter nanorods and tetrapod arms (nanowire-like), having higher surface-to-volume ratios with reasonable porosity, exhibit improved sensing behavior. Interestingly, when the nanorods\u2019 diameter and interconnected tetrapod arm thickness were comparable to the width of the depletion layer, a significant increase in sensitivity (from 2 to 30) and reduction in response/recovery time (from 58 s to 5.9 s) resulted, ascribed to rapid desorption of analyte species. Additionally, nanoparticles surface-catalyzed with Pd (~50 nm) accelerated gas sensing and lowered operating temperature (from 200 \u00b0C to 50 \u00b0C) when combined with UV photoactivation. We modeled the experimental findings using a modified general formula for ZnO methane sensors derived from the catalytic chemical reaction between methane molecules and oxygen ions and considered the structural surface-to-volume ratios (S/V) and electronic depletion region width (Ld) applicable to other gas sensors (e.g., SnO2, TiO2, MoO3, and WO3).

Apples are very valuable fruits with many health benefits, but during storage at ambient conditions, they ripen quickly and lose moisture, causing lower crispness or other negative effects, resulting in waste problems. There has been growing attention to protective edible coatings or active packaging films based on biopolymers and natural bioactive substances. Edible coatings and films allow for combination with functional ingredients or compounds, affecting the maintenance of the postharvest quality of fruits and vegetables. They also ensure the preservation of the sensory characteristics of food, and they can have antimicrobial or antioxidant properties. All these aspects play a significant role in the storage of apples, which can also help prevent waste, which is in line with the circular economy approach. The functionality of coatings and films is closely related to the type, content, and composition of active compounds, as well as their interaction with biopolymers. Active coatings with the addition of different functional compounds, such as plant extracts, phenolic acids, and nanoparticles, can be an alternative solution affecting the postharvest quality of apples during storage, maintaining the fruit\u2019s stability, and thus minimising their waste. The most important issues related to the latest reports on improving the postharvest quality of apples using edible coatings incorporated with various active substances were evaluated. Agricultural conditions and factors that affect the postharvest quality of apples were described. The requirements for protective coatings for apples should be focused on low-cost materials, including waste-based resources, good miscibility, and compatibility of components.

Changes in dietary patterns and lifestyle, such as increasing the consumption of fruits and vegetables and more balanced intakes of meat and plant foods, are a practical and effective strategy for reducing the incidence of chronic diseases. Phytonutrients (or phytochemicals) are found in eatable fruits and vegetables that, daily ingested, may exhibit a potential for modulating human metabolism in a manner favourable for the prevention of chronic and degenerative diseases. Carotenoids and flavonoids (anthocyanins, phenolic acids, polyphenols) are examples of phytonutrients. Consumption of total phytochemical intake has been consistently linked to protection from chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. To highlight the beneficial health effects of phytonutrients in plants, we choose two interesting plants, the potato and the citrus fruits. They were chosen owing to their phytonutrient content, and low price, which makes them more easily acquired in low incoming populations, and consequently they are highly consumed not only in developing but also in developed countries. Due to its high nutrient and phytochemical content, the potato can lower oxidative stress, a key mechanism for cancer and cardiovascular disease prevention. Its phenolic compounds act as antioxidants and improve heart health. Furthermore, this review emphasizes the bioactive compounds in citrus which can reduce inflammatory mediators and reactive oxygen species generation, thus attenuating the risk of neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer.

Studies have demonstrated that modulating the nutrient composition of feed and supplementing bioactive compounds, including vitamins, probiotics, prebiotics, exogenous enzymes, polyphenol compounds, and organic acids, have positively influenced the meat quality and body composition of broiler chickens. Abstract Poultry meat is becoming one of the most important animal protein sources for human beings in terms of health benefits, cost, and production efficiency. Effective genetic selection and nutritional programs have dramatically increased meat yield and broiler production efficiency.

To study growth dynamics, antagonistic activity and acid formation of two inoculant strains, Lactiplantibacillus (=Lactobacillus) plantarum \u041a\u0422-L18/1 and \u0412\u0430cillus subtilis \u0412\u0420\u0422-\u04121, that were introduced into alfalfa silage, up to 30 days of fermentation. Methods. A streptomycin-resistant strain of both above-mentioned organisms, obtained in earlier research, was used to achieve the research aims. Alfalfa was artificially wilted and dried to a dry matter content of 39\u201340 %. Fermentation was conducted under anaerobic conditions in polyethylene bags. Inoculant was added at a concentration of 108 CFU/kg alfalfa. The resulting 12 \u00d7 3 = 36 bags were kept at room temperature in a dark place for 30 days. At each examination date one sample per treatment was used and examined after cultivation of the two inoculants on elective De Man-Rogosa-Sharpe (MRS) agar and meat infusion agar (MIA), containing streptomycin. The antibacterial (ABA) and antifungal activities (AFA) were studied by the agar diffusion method. Results. After 30 days of ensiling the alfalfa samples, L. plantarum \u041a\u0422-L18/1str and \u0412. subtilis \u0412\u0420\u0422-\u04121str were still present at levels of 9.2 lg CFU/g and 6.9 lg CFU/g respectively. In the natural population of LAB, L. plantarum \u041a\u0422-L18/1str had a dominant position. After 30 days of the alfalfa fermentation L. plantarum \u041a\u0422-L18/1str and \u0412. subtilis \u0412\u0420\u0422-\u04121str maintained ABA and AFA to the PPB strains (S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, S. typhimurium) and fungal strains tested. However, the antagonistic activities of the two inoculant strains decreased during the fermentation, for L. plantarum \u041a\u0422-L18/1str from 7\u201321 %, and for \u0412. subtilis \u0412\u0420\u0422-\u04121str from 16\u201321 %. Compared to the uninoculated control treatment, the inoculated silage treatments had a lower pH level (5.2\u20135.3), an increased number of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) (by 32 %), and clostridia were no longer detected. The inoculation impacted fungi down to a level of 102\u2013103 CFU/g that can ensure the aerobic stability of the feed. Conclusions. The inoculant strains and L. plantarum \u041a\u0422-L18/1str and \u0412\u0430cillus subtilis \u0412\u0420\u0422-\u04121str showed a high competitiveness with background microbiota in an ensiling experiment with alfalfa.

In order to further tap the feeding value of whole quinoa, develop quinoa as a feed substitute for conventional crops such as corn, and improve its comprehensive utilization rate, this experiment analyzed the silage quality and mycotoxin content of mixed silage of whole-plant quinoa (WPQ) with whole-plant corn (WPC) or stevia powder(SP) in different proportions, and further improved the silage quality of mixed silage by using two lactic acid bacteria preparations (Sila-Max and Sila-Mix). The quality, microbial population, and mycotoxin levels of quinoa and corn silage, as well as that of the mixed silage of quinoa and stevia, were evaluated using single-factor analysis of variance. The impact of various lactic acid bacteria preparations on the quality of whole-quinoa and whole-corn mixed silage was investigated through two-factor analysis of variance. WPQ and WPC were mixed at the ratio of 5:5 (QB5), 6:4 (QB6), 7:3 (QB7), 8:2 (QB8), 9:1 (QB9) and 10:0 (QB10). SP was mixed with WPQ at the supplemental levels of 0.2% (QB10S2), 0.4% (QB10S4), 0.6% (QB10S6), 0.8% (QB10S8) and 1.0% (QB10S10). After 60 days of silage, the silage indexes, the number of harmful microorganisms, and the mycotoxin levels were measured, to explore the appropriate ratio of mixed silage. The membership function analysis showed that the quality of mixed silage of WPQ with SP was better, and the optimal addition amount of SP was 0.6%. The results of Max and Mix on the quality improvement test of WPQ with WPC mixed silage showed that the two lactic acid bacteria formulations increased CP and AA content, and reduced NH3-N/TN; pH was significantly lower than the control group (p < 0.01), and LA was significantly higher than the control group (p < 0.01). The microbial count results showed that the addition of lactic acid bacteria preparation significantly reduced the number of molds and aerobic bacteria, and the effect of Mix was better than that of Max. When the mixing ratio was between QB7 and QB10, mold was not detected in the lactic-acid-bacteria preparation groups. Max and Mix significantly reduced the levels of mycotoxins, both of which were far below the range of feed safety testing, and 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that the silage microbiota varied with different mixing ratios and whether lactic acid bacteria preparations were used. Max and Mix increased the relative abundance of Firmicutes, with Mix having a more significant effect, especially in the QB6 (65.05%) and QB7 (63.61%) groups. The relative abundance of Lactobacillus was significantly higher than that of the control group (p < 0.05). The relative abundance of Enterobacteriaceae and Streptococcus were negatively and positively correlated with the addition level of quinoa, respectively.

Countries with warmer climates and that produce foods susceptible to AF contamination shoulder a substantial portion of the global AF burden. Pakistan\u2019s warm climate promotes the growth of toxigenic fungi, resulting in frequent AF contamination of human foods and animal feeds. The potential for contamination in Pakistan is exacerbated by improper storage conditions and a lack of regulatory limits and enforcement mechanisms. High levels of AFs in common commodities produced in Pakistan are a major food safety problem, posing serious health risks to the population. Furthermore, aflatoxin contamination contributes to economic losses by limiting exports of these commodities. In this review, recent information regarding the fungal producers of AFs, prevalence of AF contamination of foods and feed, current regulations, and AF prevention and removal strategies are summarized, with a major focus on Pakistan.", "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-12-01", "synthetic_support_claim": "High levels of aflatoxins in Pakistani commodities are a major food safety problem and economic issue.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Aflatoxin contamination directly increases the incidence of liver cancer in the population of Pakistan."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "bce15d65b2178957b3eec061d96bec411c948030", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bce15d65b2178957b3eec061d96bec411c948030", "title": "Physicochemical characteristics, mycoflora and aflatoxins in corn grown and stored in Northern Tamaulipas, Mexico.", "abstract": "In northern Tamaulipas, M\u00e9xico, the contamination of corn by toxigenic fungi reduces grain production and quality.

In this work, we identified toxigenic fungi associated with corn grown and stored in northern Tamaulipas, identified and quantified aflatoxins and their relationships with the physicochemical characteristics of the grain, and identified the main genes responsible for aflatoxin production in A. flavus. Fungal incidence was evaluated in vitro, aflatoxin production was evaluated via HPLC, and physicochemical traits were evaluated via spectrophotometry. Three genera were identified: Fusarium, Aspergillus, and Penicillium; the latter had the highest incidence in both 2011 and 2012.

However, traditional cultivation practices often overlook the importance of these beneficial microbes, leading to reduced crop yields, lower phytochemical quality, and increased susceptibility to diseases. The domestication of MPs and the use of chemical fertilizers disrupt the natural microbial diversity in soils, essential for the health and productivity of plants. This disruption can lead to the loss of beneficial plant\u2013microbe interactions, which are vital for the production of bioactive compounds with therapeutic properties. Recent advances in microbiome research, supported by omics technologies, have expanded our understanding of how endophytic bacteria can be leveraged to enhance MP productivity and quality. Endophytic bacteria can directly boost MP productivity by promoting plant growth and health or indirectly by restoring healthy soil microbiomes. They can also be harnessed as microbial factories to produce valuable natural compounds, either by transforming plant-derived precursors into bioactive substances or by synthesizing unique metabolites that mimic MP secondary metabolites. This offers a sustainable and low-cost alternative to traditional MP cultivation, reducing the carbon footprint and preserving endangered species. In conclusion, integrating microbiome research with traditional agricultural practices could revolutionize MP cultivation.

Securing food for future generations may have wide-ranging implications for poultry well-being. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) have been studied extensively in poultry to assess stress levels in different circumstances. However, the information on HSP expression is scattered; therefore, the present review attempts to signify the importance of HSPs in various conditions, focusing mainly on poultry. Considering the importance of poultry well-being, the synthesis and release of HSPs are primarily associated with the birds\u2019 ability to cope with different stress conditions. Abstract Compared to other animal species, production has dramatically increased in the poultry sector. However, in intensive production systems, poultry are subjected to stress conditions that may compromise their well-being. Much like other living organisms, poultry respond to various stressors by synthesising a group of evolutionarily conserved polypeptides named heat shock proteins (HSPs) to maintain homeostasis. These proteins, as chaperones, play a pivotal role in protecting animals against stress by re-establishing normal protein conformation and, thus, cellular homeostasis. In the last few decades, many advances have been made in ascertaining the HSP response to thermal and non-thermal stressors in poultry. The present review focuses on what is currently known about the HSP response to thermal and non-thermal stressors in poultry and discusses the factors that modulate its induction and regulatory mechanisms. The development of practical strategies to alleviate the detrimental effects of environmental stresses on poultry will benefit from detailed studies that describe the mechanisms of stress resilience and enhance our understanding of the nature of heat shock signalling proteins and gene expression.", "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-01-01", "synthetic_support_claim": "The synthesis and release of HSPs are primarily associated with poultry's ability to cope with stress.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "HSP expression significantly improves poultry meat quality under all stress conditions."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "d3cb92eb9d734a30280873b7c56a605502c8c186", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d3cb92eb9d734a30280873b7c56a605502c8c186", "title": "Heat Stress in Broiler Chickens", "abstract": "\n Research shows that global warming has destructive effects on the environment, human health and food security.

Likewise, salinity stress (SS) is another serious abiotic stress that is also a major threat to global crop productivity. The rapid climate change increased the intensity of both stresses which pose a serious threat to global food security; therefore, it is urgently needed to tackle both stresses to ensure better crop production. Globally, different measures are being used to improve crop productivity under stress conditions. Among these measures, biochar (BC) has been widely used to improve soil health and promote crop yield under stress conditions. The application of BC improves soil organic matter, soil structure, soil aggregate stability, water and nutrient holding capacity, and the activity of both beneficial microbes and fungi, which leads to an appreciable increase in tolerance to both damaging and abiotic stresses. BC biochar protects membrane stability, improves water uptake, maintains nutrient homeostasis, and reduces reactive oxygen species production (ROS) through enhanced antioxidant activities, thereby substantially improving tolerance to both stresses. Moreover, BC-mediated improvements in soil properties also substantially improve photosynthetic activity, chlorophyll synthesis, gene expression, the activity of stress-responsive proteins, and maintain the osmolytes and hormonal balance, which in turn improve tolerance against osmotic and ionic stresses. In conclusion, BC could be a promising amendment to bring tolerance against both drought and salinity stresses. Therefore, in the present review, we have discussed various mechanisms through which BC improves drought and salt tolerance.

Soil salinization is increasing due to the impacts of climate change, reducing the area of arable land for crop production. Plant root systems are plastic, and their architecture can be modulated to (1) acquire nutrients and water for growth, and (2) respond to hostile soil environments. Saline soils inhibit primary root growth and alter root system architecture (RSA) of crop plants. In this review, we explore how crop root systems respond and adapt to salinity, focusing predominately on the staple cereal crops wheat, maize, rice, and barley, that all play a major role in global food security. Cereal crops are classified as glycophytes (salt-sensitive) however salt-tolerance can differ both between species and within a species. In the past, due to the inherent difficulties associated with visualising and measuring root traits, crop breeding strategies have tended to focus on optimising shoot traits. High-resolution phenotyping techniques now make it possible to visualise and measure root traits in soil systems. A steep, deep and cheap root ideotype has been proposed for water and nitrogen capture. Changes in RSA can be an adaptive strategy to avoid saline soils whilst optimising nutrient and water acquisition. In this review we propose a new model for designing crops with a salt-tolerant root ideotype. The proposed root ideotype would exhibit root plasticity to adapt to saline soils, root anatomical changes to conserve energy and restrict sodium (Na+) uptake, and transport mechanisms to reduce the amount of Na+ transported to leaves.

Other important benefits include promoting soil enzymatic and microbial activities, changing the architecture of roots, increasing the solubility and mobility of micronutrients, and enhancing the fertility of the soil, predominantly by nurturing the development of complementary soil microbes. Biostimulants are classified as microbial, such as arbuscular mycorrhizae fungi (AMF), plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR), non-pathogenic fungi, protozoa, and nematodes, or non-microbial, such as seaweed extract, phosphite, humic acid, other inorganic salts, chitin and chitosan derivatives, protein hydrolysates and free amino acids, and complex organic materials.

Cd toxicity disrupts various physiological processes in plants, adversely affecting growth, photosynthesis, oxidative stress responses, and secondary metabolism. AMF alleviate Cd stress in plants through multiple mechanisms, including reduced Cd transport into plant roots, improved plant nutritional status, modulation of organic acid and protein exudation, enhanced antioxidant capacity, and maintenance of ion homeostasis. AMF colonization also influences Cd speciation, bioavailability, and compartmentalization within plant tissues. The expression of metal transporter genes, as well as the synthesis of phytochelatins and metallothioneins, are modulated by AMF during Cd stress.

BNF can be severely compromised by abiotic stresses. Enhancing BNF is increasingly important not only to alleviate global food insecurity but also to reduce the environmental impact of agriculture by decreasing chemical fertilizer inputs. However, this has proven challenging using current genetic modification or bacterial nodulation methods. Here, we demonstrate that a single application of a low dose (10 mg/kg) of molybdenum disulfide nanoparticles (MoS2 NPs) can enhance soybean BNF and grain yield by 30%, compared with conventional molybdate fertilizer. Unlike molybdate, MoS2 NPs can more sustainably release Mo, which then is effectively incorporated as a cofactor for the synthesis of nitrogenase and molybdenum-based enzymes that subsequently enhance BNF. Sulfur is also released sustainably and incorporated into biomolecule synthesis, particularly in thiol-containing antioxidants. The superior antioxidant enzyme activity of MoS2 NPs, together with the thiol compounds, protect the nodules from reactive oxygen species (ROS) damage, delay nodule aging, and maintain the BNF function for a longer term. The multifunctional nature of MoS2 NPs makes them a highly effective strategy to enhance plant tolerance to abiotic stresses. Given that the physicochemical properties of nanomaterials can be readily modulated, material performance (e.g., ROS capturing capacity) can be further enhanced by several synthesis strategies.

Verticillium wilt, caused by the soil-borne pathogen Verticillium dahliae, is the most devastating disease that led to extensive yield losses and fiber quality reduction in cotton crops. Developing resistant cotton varieties through genetic engineering is an effective, economical, and durable strategy to control Verticillium wilt. However, there are few resistance gene resources in the currently planted cotton varieties, which has brought great challenges and difficulties for breeding through genetic engineering. Further revealing the molecular mechanism between V. dahliae and cotton interaction is crucial to discovering genes related to disease resistance. In this review, we elaborated on the pathogenic mechanism of V. dahliae and the resistance mechanism of cotton to Verticillium wilt. V. dahliae has evolved complex mechanisms to achieve pathogenicity in cotton, mainly including five aspects: (1) germination and growth of microsclerotia; (2) infection and successful colonization; (3) adaptation to the nutrient-deficient environment and competition of nutrients; (4) suppression and manipulation of cotton immune responses; (5) rapid reproduction and secretion of toxins. Cotton has evolved multiple physiological and biochemical responses to cope with V. dahliae infection, including modification of tissue structures, accumulation of antifungal substances, homeostasis of reactive oxygen species (ROS), induction of Ca2+ signaling, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades, hormone signaling, and PAMPs/effectors-triggered immune response (PTI/ETI).

Understanding the molecular mechanism of V. dahlia\u2013cotton interaction is important for the prevention of this disease. To analyze the transcriptome profiles in V. dahliae and cotton simultaneously, the strongly pathogenic strain Vd592 was inoculated into cotton, and the infected cotton roots at 36 h and 3 d post infection were subjected to dual RNA-seq analysis. For the V. dahliae, transcriptomic analysis identified 317 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) encoding classical secreted proteins, which were up-regulated at least at one time point during infection. The 317 DEGs included 126 carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZyme) and 108 small cysteine-rich protein genes. A pectinesterase gene (VDAG_01782) belonging to CAZyme, designated as VdPE1, was selected for functional validation. VdPE1 silencing by HIGS (host-induced gene silencing) resulted in reduced disease symptoms and the increased resistance of cotton to V. dahliae. For the cotton, transcriptomic analysis found that many DEGs involved in well-known disease resistance pathways (flavonoid biosynthesis, plant hormone signaling, and plant\u2013pathogen interaction) as well as PTI (pattern-triggered immunity) and ETI (effector-triggered immunity) processes were significantly down-regulated in infected cotton roots. The dual RNA-seq data thus potentially connected the genes encoding secreted proteins to the pathogenicity of V. dahliae, and the genes were involved in some disease resistance pathways and PTI and ETI processes for the susceptibility of cotton to V. dahliae.

This study determined the functional role of GhSTR1, a member of the ABCG subfamily of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, that mediates cotton defense responses against various plant pathogens. We identified GhSTR1 as a homolog of STR1 from Medicago truncatula and highlighted its evolutionary conservation and potential role in plant defense mechanisms. Expression profiling revealed that GhSTR1 displays tissue-specific and spatiotemporal dynamics under stress conditions caused by Verticillium dahliae and Fusarium oxysporum. Functional validation using virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) showed that silencing GhSTR1 improved disease resistance, resulting in milder symptoms, less vascular browning, and reduced fungal growth. Furthermore, the AtSTR1 loss-of-function mutant in Arabidopsis thaliana exhibited similar resistance phenotypes, highlighting the conserved regulatory role of STR1 in pathogen defense. In addition to its role in disease resistance, the mutation of AtSTR1 in Arabidopsis also enhanced the vegetative and reproductive growth of the plant, including increased root length, rosette leaf number, and plant height without compromising drought tolerance. These findings suggest that GhSTR1 mediates a trade-off between defense and growth, offering a potential target for optimizing both traits for crop improvement.

Seaweeds have gained attention in the food industry in recent years because of their composition, which includes polysaccharides, lipids, proteins, dietary fiber, and various bioactive compounds such as vitamins, essential minerals, phenolic compounds, and pigments. Extraction techniques, ranging from more traditional techniques such as maceration to novel technologies, are required to obtain these components. Pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) is a green technique that uses high temperatures and pressure applied in conjunction with a solvent to extract components from a solid matrix. To improve the efficiency of this technique, different parameters such as the solvent, temperature, pressure, extraction time and number of cycles should be carefully optimized. It is important to note that PLE conditions allow for the extraction of target analytes in a short-time period while using less solvent and maintaining a high yield. Moreover, the combination of PLE with other techniques has been already applied to extract compounds from different matrices, including seaweeds. In this way, the combination of PLE-SFE-CO2 seems to be the best option considering both the higher yields obtained and the economic feasibility of a scaling-up approximation. In addition, the food industry is interested in incorporating the compounds extracted from edible seaweeds into food packaging (including edible coating, bioplastics and bio-nanocomposites incorporated into bioplastics), food products and animal feed to improve their nutritional profile and technological properties.

In the conventional system, mineral NPK fertilization and pesticides (herbicides, fungicide, insecticide, and retardant) were applied at the recommended rates for wheat. Mechanical weed control was also used (double harrowing). In the organic system, the organic fertilizer Humac Agro was applied and the fields under the wheat were harrowed twice.

Mycotoxin binders (MTB) can reduce the mycotoxin burden in the gastrointestinal tract of the animal. Mycotoxin binders are classified in inorganic, as clays and activated carbon (AC), and organic, as yeast cell wall (YCW) and micro-ionized fibers. The adsorption of mycotoxins into MTB is due to: 1) chemical interactions where the cation exchange capacity involves different types of bounds like ion-dipole, Van der Walls forces, or hydrogen bonds; and 2) to physical characteristics of MTB like pore size, or mycotoxin structure and shape. The adsorption capacity of MTB is determined using different in vitro tests that mimic the gastrointestinal tract of the animals. A literature search was conducted to identify in vitro research where the efficacy of adsorption of MTB was determined. The search was based on 8 MTB [AC, bentonite, clinoptilolite, hydrated sodium calcium aluminosilicate (HSCAS), montmorillonite (MMT), sepiolite, YCW and zeolite] and 6 mycotoxins [aflatoxin (AF), deoxynivalenol (DON), fumonisin (FUM), ochratoxin (OTA), T-2 toxin and zearalenone (ZEA)].

Nonetheless, during the post-vaccination phase, production may be negatively impacted by mycotoxin contamination in feed. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of mycotoxin binders on immune and intestinal histopathology ameliorations against newcastle disease in vaccinated broilers with aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and ochratoxin A (OTA) toxication. Methods A total of 20 broilers were randomly assigned into 4 groups with 5 replications i.e. (C-) broiler groups with basal feed, (C+) broiler groups with AFB1 and OTA feed contamination, (T1) and (T2) broiler groups with exposed AFB1, OTA, and toxin binders as feed additives with dose 1.1 g/kg and 1.6 g/kg feed, respectively. ND vaccination was carried out on day 7 and 21. Antibody titers were evaluated from serum samples of broiler on days 14, 28, and 35 for further hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test. Histopathology of the cecum and colon organs was evaluated using HE staining on day 36. HI test and histological scoring were analyzed using the One-Way ANOVA, followed by Duncan\u2019s test with a p < 0.05 in SPSS v.26 software (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Results As a result, histopathological improvement of the cecum and colon was reported based on mucosal rupture, hemorrhage and necrosis on day 35. An increase in the mean antibody titer compared to days 14 and 28 was observed on day 35, with significant changes observed in serum samples based on the C+ group, which was significantly different from the C- and T2 groups (p < 0.05).

Meat drying is a common way of preserving meat with a rich history in many cultures around the globe. In modern days, dried meat has become a well enjoyed food product in the market because of its long shelf-life, taste and health benefits. This review aims to compile information on how the types of meat, ingredients and the used drying technologies influence the characteristics of dried meat in physicochemical, microbial, biochemical and safety features along with technological future prospects in the dried meat industry. The quality of dried meat can be influenced by a variety of factors, including its production conditions and the major biochemical changes that occur throughout the drying process, which are also discussed in this review. Additionally, the sensory attributes of dried meat are also reviewed, whereby the texture of meat and the preference of the market are emphasized. There are other aspects and concerning issues that are suggested for future studies. It is well-known that reducing the water content in meat helps in preventing microbial growth, which in turn prevents the presence of harmful substances in meat. However, drying the meat can change the characteristics of the meat itself, making consumers concerned on whether dried meat is safe to be consumed on a regular basis. It is important to consider the role of microbial enzymes and microbes in the preservation of their flavor when discussing dried meats and dried meat products. The sensory, microbiological, and safety elements of dried meat are also affected by these distinctive changes, which revolve around customer preferences and health concerns, particularly how drying is efficient in eliminating/reducing hazardous bacteria from the fish. Interestingly, some studies have concentrated on increasing the efficiency of dried meat production to produce a safer range of dried meat products with less effort and time. This review compiled important information from all available online research databases.

To prolong the shelf life of this food, a drying process can be applied; however, there is scarce information on the kinetics and drying parameters for this food material. The objective of this work was to characterize the thermal drying process of goat meat, through the mathematical modeling of convective drying kinetics, and its validation with experimental data obtained in a drying tunnel. The experiments were carried out with samples of loin (Longissumus dorsi) of Boer goat meat from the Mixteca region of Oaxaca (Mexico). Meat samples were subjected to air convection drying at 40, 50, 60 and 70 \u00b0C (with temperature oscillation), with air velocities of 1 and 2 m/s. Drying kinetics, air and meat temperature profiles, relative humidity and air flow velocity were recorded. Four models were analyzed: two-term, Midilli\u2019s model, Wang and Singh\u2019s model and a heuristic model with temperature dependence. The proposed mathematical models represented drying kinetics with an accurate fitting of experimental data, with standard errors (RMSE) in the range of 0.004\u20130.029. The estimated diffusion coefficients are consistent with the transport properties in biomaterials. The heuristic model was based on the solution of the effective diffusion equation considering the linearization of the temperature-dependent diffusion coefficient, showing a standard error in the range of 0.007\u20130.028, satisfactorily representing the temperature oscillations that allows a moisture diffusion reorganization, mainly when drastic temperature changes occur.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-11-28", "synthetic_support_claim": "The heuristic model accurately represents goat meat drying kinetics with temperature-dependent diffusion coefficients.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Goat meat can improve cardiovascular health by lowering cholesterol levels and reducing the risk of heart disease."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "30fa5242fe14c6ac5fed82ccebe84eb0fa3f5273", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/30fa5242fe14c6ac5fed82ccebe84eb0fa3f5273", "title": "Nutritional assessment and antioxidant potential of selected meat types consumed in Owhelogbo, Delta State, Nigeria", "abstract": "The present study aims at evaluating the nutritional value and antioxidant potential of various meat types (beef, pork, chicken, catfish and snails) consumed in Owhelogbo, community in Isoko Local Government, Delta State, Nigeria.

In order to achieve a lightweight network, we propose the C3k2_Ghost module to replace the C3K2 module in the original network, which can ensure a feature extraction capability and reduce model computation.

After embedding each feature extraction module in the trunk network, it improves the feature expression ability of common tomato and cherry tomato in complex field environments by means of depth-separable convolution, multi-scale pooling, and channel attention and spatial attention mechanisms. In addition, in order to further improve the detection ability of the model for tomatoes of different sizes, the SPPFELAN module is also proposed in this paper. In combining the advantages of SPPF and ELAN, multiple parallel SPPF branches are used to extract features of different levels and perform splicing and fusion.

Modern subunit vaccines offer more precise target and safe protection compared to traditional whole-pathogen vaccines. However, subunit vaccines require adjuvants to stimulate the immune system due to the less immunogenicity. Adjuvants strengthen immunogenicity by enhancing, modulating, and prolonging the immune response. Unfortunately, few adjuvants have sufficient potency and low enough toxicity for clinical use, highlighting the urgent need for new vaccine adjuvants with the characteristics of safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness. Notably, some natural polysaccharides have been approved as adjuvants in human vaccines, owing to their intrinsic immunomodulation, low toxicity, and high safety. Natural polysaccharides are mainly derived from plants, bacteria, and yeast. Partly owing to the difficulty of obtaining them, synthetic polysaccharides emerged in clinical trials. The immune mechanisms of both natural and synthetic polysaccharides remain incompletely understood, hindering the rational development of polysaccharide adjuvants.

The formation of shoots and roots, the effect on the double ridge stage, and early biomass in the vegetative stage are also impacted by heat stress. The final negative outcomes of heat stress include reduced grain number and weight, slower grain filling rate, reduced grain quality, and shorter grain filling duration. Plants have developed mechanisms to adapt to heat stress through modifications in their morphological or growth responses, physiological and biochemical pathways, and changes in enzyme reactions.

Boron (B) toxicity is one of the stresses decreasing the wheat cultivars\u2019 yield in arid and semi-arid regions around the world. Wild wheat progenitors, such as Triticum urartu Thumanian ex Gandilyan, possess a broader gene pool that harbors several genes conferring tolerance to various biotic and abiotic stresses. Unfortunately, T. urartu is not well-explored at the molecular level for its tolerance towards B toxicity in soil. In this study, for the first time, we compared the transcriptomic changes in the leaves of a high B-tolerant T. urartu genotype, PI662222, grown in highly toxic B (10 mM B in the form of boric acid) with the ones grown in the control (3.1 \u03bcM B) treatment in hydroponic conditions. The obtained results suggest that several mechanisms are involved in regulating the response of the studied T. urartu genotype toward B toxicity. All the growth parameters of T. urartu genotype, including root\u2013shoot length, root fresh weight, and root\u2013shoot dry weight, were less affected by high boron (10 mM) as compared to the boron-tolerant bread wheat cultivar. With a significant differential expression of 654 genes, 441 and 213 genes of T. urartu genotype were down- and upregulated, respectively, in the PI662222 leaves in high B in comparison to the control treatment. While key upregulated genes included those encoding RNA polymerase beta subunit (chloroplast), ATP synthase subunit gamma, chloroplastic, 60S ribosomal protein, and RNA-binding protein 12-like, the main downregulated genes included those encoding photosystem II protein D, ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase small subunit, and peroxidase 2-like. Interestingly, both Gene Ontology enrichment and KEGG pathways emphasized the possible involvement of the genes related to the photosynthetic process and apparatus in the high B tolerance of the T. urartu genotype.

The mineral contents of beans are vital in ensuring a balanced and healthy diet, as these minerals are involved in bone health, immune system function. Additionally, the technological properties of beans, including cooking time, water absorption capacity, and swelling capacity, are important in determining their culinary applications and consumer acceptance. The cooking quality and number of seeds destructed after cooking of beans significantly influence their palatability and overall consumer satisfaction. Assessing the technological properties of different bean genotypes grown under organic farming conditions allows researchers to identify genotypes with desirable cooking characteristics and texture, leading to improved consumer acceptance and culinary applications. Organic farming practices aim to produce food without the use of synthetic chemicals, promoting environmental sustainability and ensuring the production of high-quality and nutritious crops. In this research, 20 bean genotypes were grown under organic conditions for 2 years. To analyze the complex data obtained from the assessment of mineral contents and technological properties of beans, multivariate analysis techniques(correlations, cluster, scatter plot, biplots etc.) are employed. There was a positive relationship between cooking time and Ca mineral. There was a negative relationship between the coefficient of hydration and water absorption capacity and Zn mineral. Positive correlation between Fe, Mn, Cu, Mg, K, P and S elements was observed.

Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) have been used as probiotic agents due to their ability to produce a variety of beneficial compounds for cultivars and their status as safe microorganisms. Methods In this current study, the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated from several dietary sources such as curd, pickle, milk, and wheat dough. The principal focus of this study was to determine the survivability of these microorganisms in the gastrointestinal tract and to use promising strains to create probiotic drinks with numerous health benefits. The isolates were identified using a combination of morphological, biochemical, molecular and sugar fermentation patterns, like phenotypic characteristics, sugar fermentation, MR-VP reaction, catalase test, urease test, oxidase test, H2S production, NH3 production synthesis from arginine, citrate utilization, indole test, and 16s rRNA sequencing. Results Two (CM1 and OS1) of the 60 isolates obtained showed the best probiotic results and were identified as Lactobacillus acidophilus CM1 and Lactobacillus delbrueckii OS1. These organism sequences were submitted to Gen bank with accession numbers OP811266.1 and OP824643.1, respectively. The acid tolerance test results indicated that most strains could survive significantly in an acidic environment with pH levels of 2 and 3. Similarly, the salt tolerance test results showed that both Lactobacillus acidophilus CM1 and Lactobacillus delbrueckii OS1 could survive at 4 and 6% NaCl levels significantly. The isolates also showed their ability to ferment sugars such as lactose xylose, glucose, sucrose, and fructose. Discussion In conclusion, the study showed that the bacteria isolated from different food sources were indeed probiotic lactic acid bacteria and had probiotic properties. These isolates hold potential for future research in the formulation of millet-based probiotic beverages.

However, the rising global population coupled with climate change including calamities, diseases, conflicts, as well as poor agricultural practices put a huge constraint on the quantity and quality of food. Modern agriculture propelled by the green revolution has somehow been able to meet the food requirements of the ever-increasing population and is heavily dependent on chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and machinery, reducing the quality of food, and simultaneously posing a great risk of environmental quality degradation and genetic diversity reduction. The Integrated Organic Farming System (IOFS) is a novel approach that holds the potential in addressing the challenge of reconciling food production with environmental preservation. As this approach embraces zero or minimal chemical use, adopting the reprocessing and reuse of agricultural residues has led to a sustainable system that can be viewed as the closest approach to nature and a circular economy. However, certain constraints need to be addressed, such as ascertaining the effectiveness of organic fertilizers, the complexities associated with weed management, and the inadequacy of proficiency, financial resources, and technical expertise required to implement the IOFS.

Plants in UA are grown in vacant open spaces, rooftops, balconies and containers, resulting in urban organic harvest by fostering income and health improvement. The concept of UA is being utilized efficiently in many countries. However, there is still a need to promote UA by arranging community gatherings and school students, creating awareness and capacity building through education and training. Growers need to be connected to land and open spaces, enhancing value addition in UA and formulating supportive policies to foster Agri-tourism in urban farms to making it a successful initiative.

An important area of implementation of all the seventeen goals is the introduction of organic production in agriculture. This will contribute to providing the population with food; improving public health; overcoming the problems related to hunger, poverty, poor health, limited clean drinking water, energy shortages, depletion of natural resources, climate change, and pollution of both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. The EU-27 countries need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050, which exacerbates the issue. For this reason, the paper hypothesizes that organic farmland expansion will potentially result in an increase in greenhouse gas emissions. Accordingly, the purpose of the paper is to conduct empirical research into the impact of organic farmland expansion on the increase in greenhouse gas emissions in the EU. The correlation and regression analysis based on the use of available Eurostat statistics for the period 2014-2021 for selected individual European countries demonstrated that the majority of European countries exhibit a high degree of correlation.\u00a0 According to data from all EU Member States (27), the relationship is strong and directly proportional. It was found that with an increase in the area of organic farmland by 1% in the EU27, greenhouse gas emissions will increase by 0.00000025 thousand tons. The calculations revealed that ceteris paribus, greenhouse gas emissions are influenced by the expansion of organic farmland by 62.4%. Among the European countries under study, similar trends are observed in Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Spain, the Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Finland, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Meanwhile, in Lithuania and the Netherlands, the relationship is inversely proportional. Weak correlation, as evidenced by the calculated correlation coefficient, is observed in such European countries as Bulgaria (0.05); Poland (0.02); Slovakia (0.05).

In open-field soil cultivation, spatial variability in soil properties demands site-specific nutrient management and integration with variable-rate technology (VRT) to optimize fertilizer application, reduce nutrient losses, and enhance crop yields. Hydroponic solution cultivation, on the other hand, requires precise monitoring and control of nutrient solutions to maintain optimal conditions for plant growth, ensuring efficient use of water and fertilizers. This review aims to explore recent trends in soil and solution nutrient sensing technologies for open-field soil and facilitated hydroponic cultivation, highlighting advancements that promote efficiency and sustainability. Key technologies include electrochemical and optical sensors, Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled monitoring, and the integration of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) for predictive modeling.

Its distinct clinical and genetic features make it a critical area of study in neurological research and public health. Methods and materials This analysis utilized data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021, covering 371 diseases and injuries across 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021. The study focused on individuals aged 15\u201349 to characterize EOPD. Data on occurrence, frequency, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were collected. Sociodemographic measures were used to analyze patterns and differences. Statistical methods, including joinpoint regression and decomposition analysis, were employed to identify temporal patterns and factors influencing variations in EOPD burden over time. Results The global incidence of EOPD saw a significant increase between 2000 and 2009, with an average annual percentage change (AAPC) of 4.3%, continuing at a slower rate (AAPC 1.6%) from 2010 to 2021. By 2021, the incidence reached 2.1 cases per 100,000 population, up from 1.0 in 1990. Males had a higher incidence (AAPC 2.3%) compared to females (AAPC 0.8%). In 2021, 59.7% of the 81,047 global EOPD cases were male. Significant increases were observed in East Asia (AAPC 5.1%), Andean Latin America (AAPC 2.0%), and North Africa/Middle East (AAPC 1.1%), with a decline in High-income North America. China had the highest incidence in 2021 (5.17 cases per 100,000), followed by Peru and Bolivia. Saudi Arabia had the highest DALYs attributable to EOPD. The decomposition study indicated that the rise in global incidence and DALYs from 1990 to 2021 was mainly driven by epidemiological changes and population growth, with regional variations in impact.

The indiscriminate use of these chemicals not only affects the growth of plants due to the accumulation of toxic compounds, but also degrades the quality and life-supporting properties of soil. There is a dire need to develop some green approach that can resolve these issues and restore soil fertility and sustainability. The use of plant biostimulants has emerged as an environmentally friendly and acceptable method to increase crop productivity. Biostimulants contain biological substances which may be capable of increasing or stimulating plant growth in an eco-friendly manner. They are mostly biofertilizers that provide nutrients and protect plants from environmental stresses such as drought and salinity. In contrast to the protection of crop products, biostimulants not only act on the plant\u2019s vigor but also do not respond to direct actions against pests or diseases. Plant biostimulants improve nutrient mobilization and uptake, tolerance to stress, and thus crop quality when applied to plants directly or in the rhizospheric region. They foster plant growth and development by positively affecting the crop life-cycle starting from seed germination to plant maturity. Legalized application of biostimulants causes no hazardous effects on the environment and primarily provides nutrition to plants. It nurtures the growth of soil microorganisms, which leads to enhanced soil fertility and also improves plant metabolism. Additionally, it may positively influence the exogenous microbes and alter the equilibrium of the microfloral composition of the soil milieu. This review frequently cites the characterization of microbial plant biostimulants that belong to either a high-risk group or are closely related to human pathogens such as Pueudomonas, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Acinetobacter, etc. These related pathogens cause ailments including septicemia, gastroenteritis, wound infections, inflammation in the respiratory system, meningitis, etc., of varied severity under different conditions of health status such as immunocompromized and comorbidity.

Agronomic practice has told that balanced B and other mineral nutrient fertilizer applications is helpful to promote crop yield. In recent years, much research has reported that applying B can also reduce the accumulation of toxic elements such as cadmium and aluminum in plants and alleviate their toxicity symptoms. Therefore, the relation between B and other elements has become an interesting issue for plant nutritionists. Here we summarize the research progress of the interaction between B and macronutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium, potassium, magnesium, and sulfur, essential micronutrients such as iron, manganese, zinc, copper, and molybdenum, and beneficial elements such as sodium, selenium, and silicon. Moreover, the interaction between B and toxic elements such as cadmium and aluminum, which pose a serious threat to agriculture, is also discussed in this paper. Finally, the possible physiological mechanisms of the interaction between B and other elements in plants is reviewed. We propose that the cell wall is an important intermediary between interaction of B and other elements, and competitive inhibition of elements and related signal transduction pathways also play a role. Currently, research on the physiological role of B in plants mainly focuses on its involvement in the structure and function of cell walls, and our understanding of the details for interactions between B and other elements also tend to relate to the cell wall.

Research studies on nutrient omissions revealed macronutrient and micronutrient impacts on yield and oil quality. Optimal linseed production requires understanding these nutrient roles. Applying appropriate fertilizer based on these findings is essential. This study investigated the impact of full nutrients (NPKSZnB) and individual omissions (N, P, K, S, Zn, B) on Bekoji\u201014 linseed variety yield, growth, and quality in clay loam soil. Data analysis revealed nitrogen and phosphorus as key limiting nutrients.

The sum of phenolic compounds was increased by 71, 62, 55 and 21% in fermentations with P. pentosaceus CECT 4695T, L. brevis CECT 5354, P. acidilactici CECT 5765T and L. plantarum CECT 9567, respectively, while it was reduced in the fermentation with L. plantarum 748T by 21% as demonstrated by HPLC-ESI-TOF-MS. Biotransformations induced by bacterial metabolism modified the phenolic compound profile of avocado leaves in a strain-specific-dependent manner. P. pentosaceus CECT 4695T significantly increased kaempferol, P. pentosaceus 4695T, L. brevis 5354 and L. plantarum 9567 increased rutin, and dihydro-p-coumaric acid was increased by the five selected lactic acid bacteria. Total flavonoids were highly increased after fermentations with the five selected lactic acid bacteria but flavonoid glucosides were decreased by L. plantarum 748T, which was related to its higher antioxidant activity.

Different physicochemical parameters (incubation period, temperature, agitation rate, inoculum size, and pH) were optimized using the central composite design (CCD) design of response surface methodology (RSM). The maximum production of itaconic acid, i.e., 4.6 g/L, was analyzed using 10% mango peels w/v (water hydrolysate), 3 mL inoculum volume after 5 days of fermentation period at pH 3, and a temperature of 32 \u00b0C when the media was kept at a 200-rpm agitation speed.

This study aimed to develop thermoplastic starch (TPS) blended with polybutylene adipate-co-terephthalate (PBAT) films via blown-film extrusion containing ascorbyl palmitate (AP) and sodium ascorbyl phosphate (SAP) as antioxidants. The morphology, mechanism, and barrier and antioxidant properties of the films were analyzed to determine the presence of AP, SAP, and their interaction effect on the film properties. SEM showed that increasing AP and SAP content increased fibrous-like morphology, improving the TPS dispersion. AP slightly decreased mechanical properties, while SAP increased the tensile properties and seal strength of the films. All of the YM values were increased by adding AP and SAP content. The addition of AP and SAP content enhanced the interaction with TPS/PBAT networks due to increasing C-O stretching of ester bonds, compatibility, and hydrophobicity of the polymer. Both water vapor and the oxygen barrier were insignificantly affected by AP and SAP up to 1%, while the permeabilities greatly increased at higher AP and SAP contents due to non-homogeneous and void spaces between the film matrix. TPS/PBAT containing AP and SAP (\u22650.5%) effectively enhanced antioxidant capacity in 95% ethanol as a food simulant and reduced the UV light transmission of the films.

Consequently, there is a need to explore industrial hemp byproducts to improve sustainability and foster a circular economy. Extrusion processing was conducted with formulations made with hemp flakes, a byproduct of CBD oil extraction based on corn flour with 5%, 10%, and 15% hemp flakes replacement using a laboratory-scale conical twin-screw extruder. The impacts of formulation, barrel temperature, and screw speed on extrudates were evaluated. Cannabichromene (CBC), cannabinol (CBN), cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), cannabigerol (CBG), and CBD were determined with high-performance liquid chromatography before and postextrusion. Antioxidant potential (total polyphenol content [TPC] and 1,1-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging assay [DPPH]) and ferric-reducing antioxidant potential (FRAP) were determined similarly. Increasing hemp flakes in the formula reduced pasting properties significantly (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05). Expansion ratio (ER) showed significant linear effects with the amount of hemp flakes in the formula (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) and die temperature (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05), while the 10% hemp formula recorded the highest ER of 3.24 (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05). Extrusion generally reduced TPC, DPPH, FRAP, and cannabinoids compared to raw formulas. Low screw speeds and medium barrel temperatures displayed high retention of cannabinoids and antioxidants. Low screw speeds might have allowed adequate shearing, mixing, and an extended high-pressure exposure leading to the release of bound polyphenols, antioxidants, and cannabinoids. Some extrusion parameters can maintain cannabinoids and antioxidants in hemp byproducts while transforming them into puffed food products. These findings directly affect the industry, providing valuable insights for practical application. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Extrusion cooking remains one of the most economical methods of valorizing agricultural byproducts.

Despite these advantages, photosynthetic microalgae are sensitive to salt stress, which alters their physiochemical and metabolic status, ultimately reducing microalgal growth. This sensitivity highlights the importance of understanding the impact of elevated salt content on the physiochemical, metabolic, and transcriptomic profiling of Scenedesmus sp., areas that are not yet fully understood. Our findings indicate that elevated salt stress decreases photosynthetic efficiency and increases non-regulated photochemical quenching of photosystem II (PSII). Moreover, PSII-driven linear electron flow (LEF) decreased, whereas photosystem I (PSI)-driven cyclic electron flow (CEF) increased in salt-stressed cells. To better understand the electron flow from PSII to PSI under elevated salt treatment, we analyzed the excitation energy flux per reaction center (RC), per cross-section (CS), energy flux ratios, and the potential index of PSII. Additionally, flow cytometry graphs depict the viability assay of Scenedesmus sp. BHU1. Our observations further revealed an increase in biochemical attributes, such as stress biomarkers, osmoprotectants, and enzymatic antioxidants, which help scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) under salt stress. Intracellular cations (Na\u2009+\u2009and Ca2+) were increased, while K+ levels decreased, indicating mechanisms of cellular homeostasis under salt stress. UHPLC-HRMS-based lipidome analysis confirmed that increasing salt stress induces the hyperaccumulation of several fatty acids involved in adaptation.

To investigate the regulatory effect of tillage layer construction on the infiltration characteristics of snowmelt water, a typical black soil in Northeast China was selected as the research object. Based on field experiments, four protective tillage treatments (CK: control treatment; SB: sub-soiling treatment; BC: biochar regulation treatment; SB + BC: sub-soiling tillage and biochar composite treatment) were set up, and the evolution of soil physical structure, soil thawing rate, snow melting infiltration characteristics, and the feedback effect of frozen layer evolution on snowmelt infiltration were analyzed. The research results indicate that sub-soiling and the application of biochar effectively regulate soil aggregate particle size and increase soil total porosity. Among them, at the 0\u201310 cm soil layer, the soil mean weight diameter (MWD) values under SB, BC, and SB + BC treatment conditions increased by 6.25%, 16.67%, and 19.35%, respectively, compared to the CK treatment. Sub-soiling increases the frequency of energy exchange between the soil and the environment, while biochar enhances soil heat storage performance and accelerates the melting rate of frozen soil layers. Therefore, under the SB + BC treatment conditions, the maximum soil freezing rate increased by 21.92%, 5.67%, and 25.12% compared to the CK, SB, and BC treatments, respectively. In addition, sub-soiling and biochar treatment effectively improved the penetration performance of snowmelt water into frozen soil layers, significantly enhancing the soil\u2019s ability to store snowmelt water.

Traditional methods for virus identification often face limitations due to the diversity and rapid evolution of viral genomes. In response, recent efforts have focused on leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to enhance accuracy and efficiency in virus detection. However, existing AI-based approaches are primarily binary classifiers, lacking specificity in identifying viral types and reliant on nucleotide sequences. To address these limitations, VirDetect-AI, a novel tool specifically designed for the identification of eukaryotic viruses within metagenomic datasets, is introduced. The VirDetect-AI model employs a combination of convolutional neural networks and residual neural networks to effectively extract hierarchical features and detailed patterns from complex amino acid genomic data. The results demonstrated that the model has outstanding results in all metrics, with a sensitivity of 0.97, a precision of 0.98, and an F1-score of 0.98. VirDetect-AI improves our comprehension of viral ecology and can accurately classify metagenomic sequences into 980 viral protein classes, hence enabling the identification of new viruses.

Variations in the composition and gene expression of the intestinal microbiota are associated with the risk of the onset of various pathologies of the gastrointestinal tract and chronic inflammatory intestinal diseases. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the variability in the composition of the intestinal microbiota of goats of different breeds (Sarda, Maltese, and Alpine) farmed in different flocks of the region of Ogliastra (Sardegna, Italy) and to assess whether the type of feeding (natural pasture grazing-based versus intensive) could affect the intestinal bacterial composition. We also evaluated possible differences in the composition of the intestinal microbiota between healthy and Caprine arthritis encephalitis (CAE)-affected goats. The economic damage caused by this pathology is due to the reduction in milk production, with infected animals having greater susceptibility to contract diseases. The results of our study highlighted a statistically significant difference (P = 0.001\u20130.005) in the intestinal bacterial composition between the intensively managed flock and the other natural pasture-based flock.g In particular, a significantly greater abundance of Acidoaminococcaceae in the intensive flock was obgserved. Furthermore, a significantly greater abundance of Prevotellaceae was found in two localities in which, out of a total of 29 animals, only four tested negative for CAE. From these data, we deduced that the presence of Prevotellaceae can be an indication of the disease. This difference could be attributed to the farming system, the Cardedu farm being the only intensive one, and to the geographical distance of this location from the other sampling sites.

High toxicity and the ability to accumulate in soils and crops pose a serious threat to food security. To solve this problem, it is necessary to accelerate the pace of restoration of disturbed agricultural lands. Bioremediation is an effective treatment for agricultural soil pollution. It relies on the ability of microorganisms to remove pollutants. The purpose of this study is to create a consortium based on microorganisms isolated from technogenic sites for further development in the field of soil restoration in agriculture. In the study, promising strains that can remove heavy metals from experimental media were selected: Pantoea sp., Achromobacter denitrificans, Klebsiella oxytoca, Rhizobium radiobacter, and Pseudomonas fluorescens. On their basis, consortiums were compiled, which were investigated for the ability to remove heavy metals from nutrient media, as well as to produce phytohormones. The most effective was Consortium D, which included Achromobacter denitrificans, Klebsiella oxytoca, and Rhizobium radiobacter in a ratio of 1:1:2, respectively. The ability of this consortium to produce indole-3-acetic acid and indole-3-butyric acid was 18.03 \u03bcg/L and 2.02 \u03bcg/L, respectively; the absorption capacity for heavy metals from the experimental media was Cd (56.39 mg/L), Hg (58.03 mg/L), As (61.17 mg/L), Pb (91.13 mg/L), and Ni (98.22 mg/L). Consortium D has also been found to be effective in conditions of mixed heavy-metal contamination. Due to the fact that the further use of the consortium will be focused on the soil of agricultural land cleanup, its ability to intensify the process of phytoremediation has been studied.

The development of plants and food production has been greatly impacted by global warming and climate change. Therefore, minimizing these effects is crucial for agricultural production that is sustainable. Crops are becoming more resilient to abiotic stress because of sophisticated agricultural practices and a better understanding of the abiotic stress response mechanism. Both conventional and molecular breeding techniques have been used to create viable crop types both processes are time-consuming. Recently, plant breeders have shown an interest in genome editing approaches for genetic manipulation that use clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR/Cas9). To ensure the security of the food supply in the future, plant kinds with desired traits must be developed. A completely new era in plant breeding has begun because of the revolution in genome editing techniques based on the CRISPR/CRISPR-associated nuclease (Cas9) systems. All plants may effectively target a particular gene or group of loci using Cas9 and single-guide RNA (sgRNA). CRISPR/Cas9 can thereby save time and labor compared to conventional breeding methods. An easy, quick, and efficient method for directly altering the genetic sequences in cells is with the CRISPR and Cas9 systems. The CRISPR-Cas9 system, which was developed from components of the earliest known bacterial immune system, allows for targeted gene breakage and gene editing in a variety of cells/RNA sequences to guide endonuclease cleavage specificity in the CRISPR-Cas9 system. Editing can be directed to practically any genomic site by altering the guide RNA (gRNA) sequence and delivering it to a target cell along with the Cas9 endonuclease.

This review explores the detrimental impacts of elevated temperatures on maize development across various growth stages, analyzed within the source\u2013sink framework, with a particular focus on seed setting and yield reduction. It provides a broad analysis of maize cellular and molecular responses to HTS, highlighting the key roles of plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) signaling, calcium signaling, chloroplast, and the DNA damage repair (DDR) system in maize. HTS disrupts ABA signaling pathways, impairing stomatal regulation and reducing water-use efficiency, while calcium signaling orchestrates stress responses by activating heat shock proteins and other protective mechanisms. Chloroplasts, as central to photosynthesis, are particularly sensitive to HTS, often exhibiting photosystem II damage and chlorophyll degradation. Recent studies also highlight the significance of the DDR system, with genes like ZmRAD51C playing crucial roles in maintaining genomic stability during reproductive organ development.

A number of mechanical and endocrine signals from gastrointestinal tract are stimulated by fibers and their fermentation products, reach regions of brain involved in the regulation of appetite, and ultimately reduce food intake. Gastric distention, delayed gastric emptying, prevention of hypoglycemic, increased amounts of unabsorbed nutrients reaching to the ileum, and stimulation of enteroendocrine cells for secretion of cholecystokinin, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and peptide YY are among mechanisms of fibers in decreasing hunger and prolongation of satiety. Fermentation of fibers produces short-chain fatty acids that also stimulates enteroendocrine cells to secrete GLP-1 and PYY. Randomized controlled trials have shown reductions in energy intake and body weight along with increased satiation and reduced hunger following consumption of fibers. Prospective cohort studies have confirmed these results but the extent of weight loss in some studies has been small. Controversies exist between studies particularly for the effect of fibers on the gastrointestinal hormones, subsequent food intake, and the resultant weight loss.

To elucidate the above, samples of dates from three backyard orchards and soil samples from each orchard were collected to determine the content of bioactive compounds and chemical characteristics of the substrate and to determine the correlations between these. For total contents of polyphenols and flavonoids, antioxidant activity and soluble solids, the following methods were used - Folin-Ciocalteu reagent based total polyphenol estimation; aluminium chloride based total flavonoid estimation; 2, 2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical inhibition and a hand-held refractometer for soluble solid content determination.

Since P is involved in many key processes in plants, salinity and P deficiency could significantly cause serious damage to photosynthesis, the most essential physiological process for the growth and development of all green plants. Different approaches have been proposed and adopted to minimize the harmful effects of their combined effect. Optimising phosphorus nutrition seems to bring positive results to improve photosynthetic efficiency and nutrient uptake. The present work posed the question if soluble fertilizers allow wheat plants to counter the adverse effect of salt stress. A pot experiment was performed using a Moroccan cultivar of durum wheat: Karim. This study focused on different growth and physiological responses of wheat plants grown under the combined effect of salinity and P-availability. Two Orthophosphates (Ortho-A & Ortho-B) and one polyphosphate (Poly-B) were applied at different P levels (0, 30 and 45 ppm). Plant growth was analysed on some physiological parameters (stomatal conductance (SC), chlorophyll content index (CCI), chlorophyll a fluorescence, shoot and root biomass, and mineral uptake). Fertilized wheat plants showed a significant increase in photosynthetic performance and nutrient uptake. Compared to salt-stressed and unfertilized plants (C+), CCI increased by 93%, 81% and 71% at 30 ppm of P in plants fertilized by Poly-B, Ortho-B and Ortho-A, respectively. The highest significant SC was obtained at 45 ppm using Ortho-B fertilizer with an increase of 232% followed by 217% and 157% for both Poly-B and Ortho-A, respectively. The Photosynthetic performance index (PItot) was also increased by 128.5%, 90.2% and 38.8% for Ortho-B, Ortho-A and Poly B, respectively. In addition, Poly-B showed a significant enhancement in roots and shoots biomass (49.4% and 156.8%, respectively) compared to C+. Fertilized and salt-stressed plants absorbed more phosphorus. The P content significantly increased mainly at 45 ppm of P. Positive correlations were found between phosphorus uptake, biomass, and photosynthetic yield. The increased photochemical activity could be due to a significant enhancement in light energy absorbed by the enhanced Chl antenna.

Response surface methodology (RSM) was employed to determine the optimal decolorization conditions, whereas molecular docking was performed to propose an enzymatic degradation mechanism. One colony, displaying the typical morphological characteristics of Aspergillus oryzae common in miso\u2010paste starters, exhibited high decolorization potential for RV5. Validation of the RSM analysis using whole fungus A. oryzae RH1 revealed a decolorization performance of 92.33% under the following optimized conditions: 33\u00b0C, pH 6.2, dye concentration of 200\u00a0ppm, and incubation period of 6 days. The optimal conditions for dye degradation via enzymatic catalysis, with peroxidase as the enzyme, were 51\u00b0C and pH 3.0, resulting in a decolorization performance of 48.95% after 60\u00a0min of incubation. Molecular docking analysis suggested that the DyP\u2010type peroxidase produced by A. oryzae RH1 can oxidize the azo bond, which is the chromophore group of RV5.

Different food matrices created by hybrid products have impact on the digestive processes and outcomes in vitro and in vivo, and the bioavailability of protein, lipid, and mineral nutrients is modified, hence these aspects are reviewed. The functional properties of hybrid products change with regard to type of alternative protein source used. In hybrid products, deficiencies in amino acids in alternative proteins are balanced by amino acids from meat proteins, resulting in wholesome products.

These fertilizers could readily dissolve in the irrigation water or soil moisture, causing excessive release of the nutrients that plants cannot uptake from the root zone. The excess nutrients in the soil further harm the environment via surface run-off, leaching, and volatilization. Thus, materials with high water absorption and retention capacity, and precise control over the prolonged fertilizer release offer a potential solution to address these issues.

Two factors were researched: (I) biofertilizers: control object (no biofertilizer), Azotobacter chroococcum + Azospirillum lipoferum Br 17, Arthrobacter agilis + Bacillus megaterium var. phosphaticum, and combined application of atmospheric nitrogen-fixing bacteria with phosphate solubilizing bacteria; (II) green manures: control object (no green manure application), Trifolium pratense L., Trifolium pratense L. + Lolium multiflorum L., and Lolium multiflorum L. The results show that the most favorable abundance of microorganisms determined in the soil after harvesting Hordeum vulgare L. was recorded after the application of biofertilizers containing atmospheric nitrogen-fixing bacteria with phosphate-solubilizing bacteria under a mixture of Trifolium pratense L. with Lolium multiflorum L. Plowing green manure from a mixture of Trifolium pratense L. with Lolium multiflorum L. resulted in an average increase of 39% in grain yield of Triticum spelta L., while the application of a biofertilizer containing Azotobacter chroococcum + Azospirillum lipoferum Br 17 + Arthrobacter agilis + Bacillus megaterium var. phosphaticum resulted in an average increase of 63%.

To better reveal the relationship between the two, 15 japonica rice samples from Northeast China were selected. The sensory evaluation method was used to evaluate rice's EQ intuitively. Then, the texture analyzer and gas chromatography\u2010olfactometry\u2010mass spectrometry (GC\u2010O\u2010MS) were used to analyze the texture and aroma characteristics of cooked rice. Finally, a Pearson correlation analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between the sensory evaluation results, aroma compounds, and texture of the cooked rice.The sensory evaluation scores in the Jilin and Liaoning regions were higher than those in the Heilongjiang region. The hardness, cohesiveness, and chewiness of cooked rice in the Jilin region were lower than those in the Heilongjiang and Liaoning regions. The sample in Heilongjiang had the highest content of aroma compounds, but it was inversely proportional to the odor score in the sensory evaluation. Pearson correlation analysis showed that hexanal, (E)\u20102\u2010heptenal, octanal, and (E)\u20102\u2010octenal were negatively correlated with cooked rice hardness, while hexanal, octanal, and (E)\u20102\u2010dodecenal were positively correlated with cohesiveness.Aroma compounds and texture jointly determine the EQ of cooked rice, and a certain correlation exists between the two.

However, there is no report on the effect of aromatic rice in rice\u2013potato rotation on aroma characteristics. In order to study the influences of winter-planted potatoes on the yield, quality, and 2-AP biosynthesis of aromatic rice grains, the commonly cultivated aromatic rice variety Meixiangzhan-2 and the potato cultivar Huashu-5 were selected as experimental materials for a three-year consecutive field experiment with different tillage patterns consisting of rice\u2013winter fallow as the control group (CK) and rice\u2013potato rotation as the experimental group (RP). The results indicated that the RP treatment enhanced the soil nutrient content and decreased the bulk density.

Meanwhile, RP treatment improved the brown rice rate by 2.61%, milled rice rate by 4.53%, head milled rice rate by 7.51%, and crude protein content by 6.98%. Regarding 2-AP biosynthesis in grains, in contrast to CK, the RP treatment raised the levels of related precursors (\u03941-pyrroline, \u03941-pyrrolidine-5-carboxylic acid, and proline increased by 8.95%, 18.14%, and 13.75%, respectively) and enzymes (proline dehydrogenase, ornithine transaminase, and diamine oxidase increased by 18.37%, 14.61%, and 11.36%, respectively) in its synthesis pathway, thereby facilitating the accumulation of 2-AP.

Delayed treatment can exacerbate the conditions, jeopardizing patient lives. Currently, no vaccine has been approved to prevent these two diseases simultaneously. In contrast to traditional vaccines, mRNA vaccines offer advantages such as high efficacy, rapid development, and low cost, and their applications are gradually expanding. This study aims to develop multi-epitope mRNA vaccines argeting Brucella melitensis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (L4 strain) utilizing immunoinformatics approaches. The proteins Omp25, Omp31, MPT70, and MPT83 from the specified bacteria were selected to identify the predominant T- and B-cell epitopes for immunological analysis. Following a comprehensive evaluation, a vaccine was developed using helper T lymphocyte epitopes, cytotoxic T lymphocyte epitopes, linear B-cell epitopes, and conformational B-cell epitopes. It has been demonstrated that multi-epitope mRNA vaccines exhibit increased antigenicity, non-allergenicity, solubility, and high stability. The findings from molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation revealed a robust and enduring binding affinity between multi-epitope peptides mRNA vaccines and TLR4. Ultimately, Subsequently, following the optimization of the nucleotide sequence, the codon adaptation index was calculated to be 1.0, along with an average GC content of 54.01%. This indicates that the multi-epitope mRNA vaccines exhibit potential for efficient expression within the Escherichia coli(E. coli) host. Analysis through immune modeling indicates that following administration of the vaccine, there may be variation in immunecell populations associated with both innate and adaptive immune reactions. These types encompass helper T lymphocytes (HTL), cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), regulatory T lymphocytes, natural killer cells, dendritic cells and various immune cell subsets.

Climate change adversities in agriculture and food security are increasing. Recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has severely affected global food supply chains. Economic and social instability from the pandemic contribute to long-term disturbances. Additionally, conflicts such as war directly affect agriculture by environmental degradation, violence, and breaches of national and international trade agreements. A combination of food security and climate change challenges along with increased conflicts among nations and post-COVID-19 social and economic issues bring bigger and more serious threats to agriculture. This necessitates the strategic design of policies through multifaceted fields regarding food systems.

A multi-step approach to developing sustainable agri-food districts is outlined. How these districts, as integrated systems and meso-level organizational forms, can enhance sustainability through governance is then assessed. This research uses a context-driven analysis pathway involving stakeholder participation and needs identification. The theoretical background, the Italian regulatory framework, and a case study from Lombardy are presented. Needs are identified through participatory approaches and actions are prioritized using desk research and a narrative SWOT analysis combined with key stakeholder discussions (focus group). A total of eighteen needs are identified and categorized into 3 dimensions of sustainability: economic, environmental, and socio-institutional. Findings indicate that agri-food district organization has great potential to help achieve local and regional policy goals in line with the shift to sustainable approaches in the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). The paper proposes actions to strengthen district capacity-building, focusing on internal governance and sustainable production chains. Additionally, initiatives to attract young people to rural areas and agreements for ecosystem services in agri-food districts are suggested. These actions aim to promote sustainability and competitiveness while addressing challenges related to governance, innovation, branding, demographics, and environment.

Plant\u2010based alternatives (PBAs) to milk seek to cater to the preferences of a share of consumers regarding sustainability, lifestyle or health\u2010related matters (e.g. allergies and lactose intolerance). Though popular, PBAs do not stand as suitable nutritional substitutes for milk. These considerations emphasise the complex relationships between nutritional content and consumer preferences.

We explore patterns of complementarity or substitutability between standard milk, reduced\u2010fat milk and organic milk, and an aggregate group of PBAs. We use these results to calculate nutrient elasticities and assess changes in nutrient availability in response to prices and expenditure variations. We estimate a Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System using purchase records for 2460 NZ households in 2021. We find that demand for standard milk does not show any substitutional relationship with PBAs. On the contrary, increases in the PBAs price lead households to switch towards standard milk, thereby increasing the availability of essential nutrients.

Methods: Data from the UK Biobank database were analyzed (n = 372,492). According to baseline data from the food frequency questionnaire, two main dietary patterns (Western and prudent) were identified using principal component analysis. We used cox proportional hazards models to explore the associations of individual food groups and dietary patterns with NAFLD, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. Results: During a median follow-up of 12 years, 3527 hospitalized NAFLD, 1643 cirrhosis, and 669 liver cancer cases were recorded among 372,492 participants without prior history of cancer or chronic liver diseases at baseline.

The reliability of the results was verified by a series of sensitivity and heterogeneity tests. Subsequently, clinical validation was conducted using NHANES (2005-2018), involving 22\u00a0257 participants, grouped by the type of tea.

Models were constructed by logistic regression to estimate the role of tea consumption (Q1-4) on NAFLD. Finally, using fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4) to evaluate the severity of hepatic fibrosis, the effect of tea consumption (Q1-4) on the degree of hepatic fibrosis was investigated by linear regression.

Results Our analysis included 121,329 participants with a median follow-up of 604.43 weeks, during which 4,018 developed CLD. A higher DII, indicating a more inflammatory diet, was associated with a 16% increased risk of CLD [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.162, P = 0.001], with each unit increase in DII elevating the risk by 3.3% (HR: 1.033, P < 0.001).

The results reveal significant regulatory gaps, particularly in enforcement mechanisms and iTFA detection methods. Key challenges are also identified in the present study, including inconsistent compliance monitoring, varying analytical methods for iTFA detection, and contradictions between EU and Spanish regulatory frameworks. Additionally, in this work, the need for harmonized approaches to ultra-processed food regulation is emphasized. Further, the conclusion is that despite the current regulations providing a foundation for iTFA control, it is compulsory to enhance the monitoring systems, and clearer regulatory guidelines are necessary. These would contribute valuable insights for policymakers, food industry stakeholders, and public health professionals working towards effective iTFA regulation.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2024-11-28", "synthetic_support_claim": "The results reveal significant regulatory gaps, particularly in enforcement mechanisms and iTFA detection methods.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "iTFAs are completely eradicated in the European Union and Spain due to current regulatory frameworks."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "cf062c7678a43d9b923f0995f1844c5b1208d79b", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cf062c7678a43d9b923f0995f1844c5b1208d79b", "title": "Promoting the Emerging Role of Pulse By-Products as Valuable Sources of Functional Compounds and Novel Food Ingredients", "abstract": "The growth of the human population worldwide has increased food demand, generating the massive production of foods and consequently causing enormous production of waste every year.

Early accurate and objective prediction of the risk of early ENFI after gastric cancer resection is critical to guide clinical enteral nutrition practice. Materials and methods This study included 470 patients who underwent radical gastric cancer surgery at the Division of Gastric Surgery of a tertiary hospital in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, between November 2021 and October 2022. The patients were divided into a training set (n = 329) and a validation set (n = 141) in a 7:3 ratio. The predictors were first screened through Lasso regression. Subsequently, multifactorial logistic regression analysis was used to establish a model for predicting patients' early ENFI column charts after gastric cancer resection. Internal and external validation of the model were performed on the training set and validation set data, respectively, including plotting the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and calibration curves to assess the differentiation and calibration of the prediction model. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test was also used to assess the fit of the model. Results The incidence of early ENFI in postoperative patients with gastric cancer was 44.68% in the training set and 43.97% in the validation set. The final predictors entered into the model were enteral nutrition solution type (OR1 = 1.31/OR2 = 7.23), preoperative enteral nutrition pre-adaptation technique (OR = 0.29), surgical approach (OR = 2.21), preoperative Profile of Mood State-Short Form score (OR = 5.07), and intra-abdominal pressure (OR = 6.79). In the internal validation, the AUC was 0.836, the 95% CI ranged from 0.792 to 0.879, the Hosmer-Lemeshow test showed \u03c7 2 = 4.368 and P = 0.737, the sensitivity was 0.775, and the specificity was 0.741.

The bran fraction of wheat, maize, brown rice and other cereals contains high levels of phytate, free and total phenolics, and endogenous enzymes such as amylases, phytase, xylanase, \u03b2-glucanase and feruloyl esterase, whose activities can be increased by germination. The preliminary steps of digestion begin in the oral cavity where substrates for the action of endogenous cereal and salivary enzymes start to be released from the food matrix. IP6 released from phytate complexes with arabinoxylans, starch and protein bodies would eventually enhance the absorption of nutrients, including phenolics, by regulating tight junctions and, together with ferulic acid (FA), would maintain cell barrier integrity and epithelial antibacterial immunity. In addition, both IP6 and FA exert potent and complementary antioxidant effects, while FA together with IPx generated through advanced hydrolysis of IP6 by endogenous and microbial phytases may affect digestive enzyme activity and incretin secretion, resulting in modulated insulin and glucagon release and prevention of various diabetic complications. Contrary to widespread negative attitudes towards phytate, in this review, we present the strategy of selecting cereals with high phytate and phenolic content, as well as high endogenous phytase, feruloyl esterase and endoxylanase activities, to produce value-added health-promoting foods.

Six blends of corn starch and MBP isolate (0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, and 25% w/w) were hydrated to three different moisture contents (MCs) (16%, 19%, and 21% w.b.). The blends were extruded using a twin\u2010screw extruder at three screw speeds (SSs) (300, 400, and 500 rpm). The resulting extrudates were evaluated for their water solubility index, water absorption index, expansion ratio (ER), true density, unit density, and porosity. As the protein content increased, the porosity of the extrudates increased. The ER of all extrudates ranged from 2.90 to 5.46, with the largest ER observed at an SS of 400 rpm, an MC of 19%, and 25% MBP inclusion. The porosity of the extrudates ranged from 1.79% to 11.42%. SS and protein content had a significant impact (p < 0.05) on the porosity and ER of the extrudate.

Although temporal dynamics of grain moisture and its functional and environmental determinants have been broadly demonstrated, we still do not have a comprehensive understanding of the distribution of water phase within a kernel. Methods We investigated the relationship between tissue structural traits, including embryo volume (EMBV), endosperm volume (ENDV), vitreous endosperm volume (VEV), floury endosperm volume (FEV), and water content in different phases, such as bound water, semi-bound water, and free water, in maize kernels under different cultivars, nitrogen application rates, and soaking durations by combining low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (LF-NMR) and X-ray microcomputed tomography (\u03bc-CT) for kernels. Results The results demonstrate that bound water is the major phase (57-82%) in maize kernels, and this proportion decreases with prolonged soaking duration. The bound water content and semi-bound water content positively correlate to ENDV, VEV, and EMBV, whereas free water content correlates to ENDV, EMBV, and VEV in descending order of correlation coefficient. This indicates that water might penetrate the embryo through the pedicel and vitreous endosperm through the pericarp during soaking. Discussion Finally, we suggested that the proportion of semi-bound water could be a robust indicator to predict moisture content in maize kernels.

This study is the first to explore the use of essential oils (EOs), recognized for their antimicrobial properties, as a potential method to prevent postharvest losses from P. olsonii. Antifungal activity was tested for ten EOs at a concentration of 625 \u03bcL/L using the vapor diffusion method. Thyme, wild thyme, savory, oregano, and marjoram completely inhibited fungal growth over 14 days. Thyme EO, at a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 250 \u03bcL/L, fully inhibited all strains, while oregano, wild thyme, and savory were effective at 500 \u03bcL/L. Marjoram EO showed weaker activity. The lowest IC90 values, ranging from 35.72 to 162.72 \u03bcL/L, were estimated for thyme and oregano. In cherry tomatoes, oregano EO completely halted P. olsonii growth at 250 \u03bcL/L; thyme was effective for seven days; wild thyme and savory for two days. Thyme EO prevented P. olsonii spore germination at 500 \u03bcL/L for seven days, though germination occurred at half that concentration. The IC90 values varied between 256.2 and 138.7 \u03bcL/L depending on the strain. The vapor phase of EOs at 125 \u03bcL/L influenced the sensory characteristics of cherry tomatoes; however, for thyme and oregano, this effect was not negative due to their culinary association with tomato flavor.

In our study, we used tomato to evaluate the allocation of absorbed light energy in young and mature leaves, and to estimate if the extent of photoinhibition and photoprotection can be affected by the leaf age. A reduced efficiency of the oxygen-evolving complex, in young leaves compared to mature ones, resulted in a donor-side photoinhibition, as judged from the significantly lower Fv/Fm ratio, in young leaves. The detected increased 1O2 production in young leaves was probably due to a donor-side photoinhibition. The effective quantum yield of photosystem II (PSII) photochemistry (\u03a6PSII), at low light intensity (LLI, 426 \u03bcmol photons m\u22122 s\u22121), was significantly lower in young compared to mature leaves. Moreover, the non-significant increase in non-photochemical energy loss in PSII (\u03a6NPQ) could not counteract the decreased \u03a6PSII, and as a result the non-regulated energy loss in PSII (\u03a6NO) increased in young leaves, compared to mature ones. The significantly lower \u03a6PSII in young leaves can be attributed to the increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) creation that diminished the efficiency of the open PSII reaction centers (Fv\u2019/Fm\u2019), but without having any impact on the fraction of the open reaction centers. The reduced excess excitation energy, in mature leaves compared to young ones, at LLI, also revealed an enhanced PSII efficiency of mature leaves. However, there was almost no difference in the light energy use efficiency between young and mature leaves at the high light intensity (HLI, 1000 \u03bcmol photons m\u22122 s\u22121). The ability of mature tomato leaves to constrain photoinhibition is possible related to an enhanced photosynthetic function and a better growth rate. We concluded that the light energy use efficiency in tomato leaves is influenced by both the leaf age and the light intensity.

In vitro, the effects of MPDE on DBM larvae were assessed using bioassays, including oviposition, feeding preferences, and insecticidal activity. In vivo, MPDE was sprayed on green mustard plants infested with DBM larvae, and plant growth, survival, and yield were monitored. Antioxidant activity was measured using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging and reducing power assays. The results of the study at p < 0.05 showed that MPDE significantly reduced oviposition and feeding by DBM, with higher concentrations demonstrating greater effectiveness.

Key processes in soil are included by linear or non-linear process formulations to maintain transparency and to enable data availability for spatially explicit application from field up to national level. Calculated national trends in nutrient losses over 2000-2020 compared well with independent estimates and showed a reduction in N and P input of 26 to 33\u202f%, whereas the surplus declined by 33\u202f% for N and 86\u202f% for P due to increased crop yields and reduced inputs. This was accompanied by a reduction of 30-35\u202f% in atmospheric emissions of ammonia and nitrous oxide as well a decline in N and P runoff of 35 and 10\u202f%, respectively, whereas the emission of methane increased with 4\u202f%. Model results compared well with (i) large scale observations of ammonia concentrations in air and nitrate concentrations in upper groundwater and ditch water, (ii) with nitrous oxide emissions and phosphorus adsorption in experiments at field scale and (iii) with metal adsorption in large scale soil datasets. Various mitigation measures were evaluated in view of policy ambitions for climate, soil and environmental quality for 2030, i.e. a reduction of 50\u202f% for NH3, 11-17\u202f% for GHG, 20\u202f% for N runoff and 40\u202f% for P runoff and an ambition of 50\u202f% GHG emission reduction for 2050. The measures focused on a combination of animal feeding, low emission housing and application technologies, improved crop, soil and nutrient management, all being applied with an effectiveness of 100\u202f% and 50\u202f%, respectively. In addition, we evaluated impacts of 50\u202f% livestock reduction, and combination scenarios of measures and livestock reduction. Full implementation of all measures can reduce NH3 emission, N leaching and N runoff by approximately 40-50\u202f% and GHG emissions by approximately 30\u202f%, but there is less potential to reduce P runoff, being <10\u202f%. The combination of a more likely 50\u202f% implementation/effectiveness of measures with 25\u202f% livestock reduction leads to a comparable reduction.

In this paper, we review (i) the availability and composition of organic resources, (ii) their agronomic value and risk of emissions, (iii) potential measures to reduce their emissions, and (iv) future challenges to support farmers and policy makers. The total amount of organic resource applied to soil amounted on average 41 kg nitrogen per ha agricultural land, 9 kg phosphorus per ha, and 456 kg carbon per ha in EU-27 + UK in 2017. Solid pig and cattle manures and cattle slurry are the most used organic resources. The availability of new organic resources from food processing, sewage sludge, municipal bio-wastes, and upcoming manure treatment techniques as fertilizer or soil conditioner is expected to strongly increase over the coming decade. Insight is needed into the composition of organic resources, the plant-availability of nutrients, the degradability of organic matter and the presence of contaminants. Measurement techniques become available to characterize soils, manures, crops, and emissions to the environment. However, the interpretation, and integration of data, and recommendations to farmers and policymakers using large amounts of data is expected to become more and more challenging. Many measures are available to improve nutrient and carbon management and to reduce emissions, including proper application, technological measures and structural changes in agriculture.

Enhancing NUE necessitates a comprehensive understanding of the biochemical and physiological mechanisms driving N uptake and utilization. The study evaluated the NUE heterosis of 7 inbred lines and their 12 hybrids under low and high N conditions during early vegetative growth. Significant genotypic variations across traits were analyzed using analysis of variance, principal component analysis, correlation, regression, and structural equation modeling. The key contributors to genetic variation included shoot dry weight, N accumulation, and NUE. Hybrids demonstrated enhanced root architecture, superior enzymatic activities of nitrate reductase (NR) and glutamine synthetase (GS), and improved morphological traits, photosynthetic efficiency, and N accumulation, resulting in greater biomass production, N accumulation, and NUE compared to inbred lines. Among hybrids, Zheng58 \u00d7 PH4CV exhibited the highest NUE, driven by efficient N uptake, robust enzymatic activity, and substantial N accumulation. Nitrogen uptake efficiency (NUpE) correlated strongly with root traits such as activity (r = 0.80 ***), length (r = 0.73 ***), surface area (r = 0.67 ***), GS activity (r = 0.84 ***), and dry weight (r = 0.92).

About three-quarters of peanut production occurs worldwide in arid and semi-arid regions, making drought an important concern in peanut production. In the US about two-thirds of peanuts are grown in non-irrigated lands, where drought accounts for 50 million USD loss each year. The looming threat of climate change exacerbates this situation by increasing erratic rainfall. Drought not only reduces yield but also degrades product quality. Peanuts under drought stress exhibit higher levels of pre-harvest aflatoxin contamination, a toxic fungal metabolite detrimental to both humans and animals. One way to sustain peanut production in drought-prone regions and address pre-harvest aflatoxin contamination is by developing drought-tolerant peanut cultivars, a process that can be accelerated by understanding the underlying physiological and genetic mechanisms for tolerance to drought stress. Different physiological attributes and genetic regions have been identified in drought-tolerant cultivars that help them cope with drought stress. The advent of precise genetic studies, artificial intelligence, high-throughput phenotyping, bioinformatics, and data science have significantly improved drought studies in peanuts. Yet, breeding peanuts for drought tolerance is often a challenge as it is a complex trait significantly affected by environmental conditions.

Although both the plant and soil microbiome have been studied over the decades, the efficiency of translating the laboratory and greenhouse findings to the field is largely dependent on the ability of the inoculants or beneficial microorganisms to colonize the soil and maintain stability in the ecosystem. Further, the plant and its environment are two variables that influence the plant and soil microbiome\u2019s diversity and structure. Thus, in recent years, researchers have looked into microbiome engineering that would enable them to modify the microbial communities in order to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the inoculants. The engineering of environments is believed to support resistance to biotic and abiotic stressors, plant fitness, and productivity. Population characterization is crucial in microbiome manipulation, as well as in the identification of potential biofertilizers and biocontrol agents. Next-generation sequencing approaches that identify both culturable and non-culturable microbes associated with the soil and plant microbiome have expanded our knowledge in this area.

Despite extensive research on CLPs, the individual roles of these analogues and their proportion in driving biological activity have remained largely overlooked. In this study, we purified and chemically characterized CLP variants from Bacillus velezensis UMAF6639 and tested them individually for their antifungal and plant growth-promoting effects.

We show how antifungal activity and seed radicle growth promotion relied on the lipopeptide structural variant and concentration based on the physiological ratio calculated for each lipopeptide variant. Notably, we found that the most toxic variants were the least abundant, which likely minimized autotoxicity while preserving bioactivity. This balance is achieved through synergistic interactions with more abundant, less aggressive analogues.

Fusarium phytopathogens infect a wide variety of plants and cause symptoms ranging from stunted growth, fruit or seed decay, yellowing, and wilting of the leaves and cankers to root or stem decay.

Bingol\u201016 had the lowest, while Malatya\u201059 had the highest Mn contents. Stability analysis was performed using the \u2018STABILITYSOFT\u2019 method and found 10 stable accessions. The cluster constellation plot was generated using JMP statistical software. A total of 7900 DArTseq markers were used for association analysis, identifying 16 markers across four chromosomes (Pv2, Pv5, Pv7 and Pv11). Notably, markers DArT\u20103374915 and DArT\u20103375187 exhibited consistent associations across different environments, making them promising candidates for Mn\u2010focused breeding programmes. Gene annotation and interactome analysis, including BLAST searches and protein\u2013protein interaction analysis, revealed associations of candidate genes with Mn concentration regulation, shedding light on potential mechanisms underlying Mn accumulation in common beans.

Examples include bone development, enzyme function, nerve signaling, and the immune response. Both the deficiencies and toxicities of minerals can have significant health implications.

Trace mineral deficiencies, such as iron and zinc. Selenium deficiency impairs oxygen transport, immune function, and antioxidant defenses, contributing to anemia, delaying wound healing, and increasing susceptibility to infectious diseases. Conversely, excessive intake of minerals can have severe health consequences. Hypercalcemia can cause kidney stones and cardiac arrhythmias as well as soft-tissue calcification, whereas excessive iron deposition can lead to oxidative stress and organ/tissue damage. Maintaining adequate mineral levels through a balanced diet, guided supplementation, and monitoring at-risk populations is essential for good health and preventing disorders related to deficiencies and toxicities. Public health interventions and education about dietary sources of minerals are critical for minimizing health risks and ensuring optimal well-being across populations.

Assessing the risk of various disposal techniques can be quite useful in recommending appropriate management. The preparation of sewage sludge biochar (SSB) and its impacts on soil characteristics, plant health, nutrient leaching, and greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) are critically reviewed in this study. Comparing the features of SSB obtained at various pyrolysis temperatures revealed changes in its elemental content. Lower hydrogen/carbon ratios in SSB generated at higher pyrolysis temperatures point to the existence of more aromatic carbon molecules. Additionally, the preparation of SSB has an increased ash content, a lower yield, and a higher surface area as a result of the rise in pyrolysis temperature. The worldwide potential of SS output and CO2-equivalent emissions in 2050 were predicted as factors of global population and common disposal management in order to create a futuristic strategy and cope with the quantity of abundant global SS. According to estimations, the worldwide SS output and associated CO2-eq emissions were around 115 million tons dry solid (Mt DS) and 14,139 teragrams (Tg), respectively, in 2020. This quantity will rise to about 138 Mt DS sewage sludge and 16985 Tg CO2-eq emissions in 2050, a 20% increase.

This study assesses the effects of biochar on soil respiration, pH, and electrical conductivity (EC) in savanna soils over a 45-day incubation trail in the laboratory. Four different biochar treatments (0, 2, 4, and 6 t/ha) were used in the study. The treatments were established at 26\u00b0C, and after 2, 5, and 10 days, the CO2 levels were recorded.

It is naturally occurring in plants, however, produced commercially by fermentation. It is also produced endogenously via the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Consumers perceive erythritol as less healthy than sweeteners extracted from plants, including sucrose. This review evaluates that perspective by summarizing current literature regarding erythritol\u2019s safety, production, metabolism, and health effects. Dietary erythritol is 30% less sweet than sucrose, but contains negligible energy. Because it is almost fully absorbed and excreted in urine, it is better tolerated than other sugar alcohols. Evidence shows erythritol has potential as a beneficial replacement for sugar in healthy and diabetic subjects as it exerts no effects on glucose or insulin and induces gut hormone secretions that modulate satiety to promote weight loss. Long-term rodent studies show erythritol consumption lowers body weight or adiposity. However, observational studies indicate positive association between plasma erythritol and obesity and cardiometabolic disease. It is unlikely that dietary erythritol is mediating these associations, rather they reflect dysregulated PPP due to impaired glycemia or glucose-rich diet. However, long-term clinical trials investigating the effects of chronic erythritol consumption on body weight and risk for metabolic diseases are needed.

The objective of this narrative review is to provide a critical consideration of the safety and efficacy of weight management evidence for LNCSs that have been reviewed/approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and have the highest frequency of use: acesulfame potassium, allulose, aspartame, erythritol, monk fruit, saccharin, stevia, sucralose, and xylitol. Safety assessments by the authoritative bodies for the World Health Organization, European Union, and United States were reviewed. Additionally, emerging topics of interest regarding the safety of these sweeteners commonly cited in the recent literature or highlighted in the media are discussed. Collectively, authoritative assessments and the primary literature support the safety of the sweeteners reviewed herein, with high concordance of safety substantiation across authoritative bodies. Weight management efficacy, measured by various adiposity indices in epidemiological studies, ranges from no effect to a slight positive association. Clinical trials with various mixtures of LNCSs more consistently indicate LNCS use is associated with lower adiposity indices. The latter are ascribed greater evidentiary weight, and recent application of statistical methods to better correct for potential biases in cohort studies reveals they are more consistent with the clinical trial findings. Studies that investigated individual sweeteners were limited but suggestive of differing effects or lack of sufficient data to support any formal conclusions on their efficacy for weight management.

Therefore, there is a growing demand for high-quality fruits and vegetables. Nevertheless, fruits and vegetables deteriorate due to their high moisture content, resulting in a 40\u201350% loss. Drying is a common food preservation technique in the food industry to increase fruits and vegetables\u2019 shelf-life. However, drying causes chemical modifications, changes in microstructure, and bioactives, thus, lowering the final product\u2019s quality as a considerable amount of bioactives compounds and antioxidants are lost. Conventional pretreatments such as hot water blanching, and osmotic pretreatment have improved fruit and vegetable drying performance. However, these conventional pretreatments affect fruits\u2019 bioactive compounds retention and microstructure. Hence, emerging thermal (infrared blanching, microwave blanching, and high-humidity hot-air impingement blanching) and non-thermal pretreatments (cold plasma, ultrasound, pulsed electric field, and edible films and coatings) have been researched. So the question is; (1) what are the mechanisms behind emerging non-thermal and thermal technologies\u2019 ability to improve fruits and vegetables\u2019 microstructure, texture, and drying performance? (2) how do emerging thermal and non-thermal technologies affect fruits and vegetables\u2019 bioactive compounds and antioxidant activity? and (3) what are preventing the large-scale commercialization of these emerging thermal and non-thermal technologies\u2019 for fruits and vegetables, and what are the future recommendations? Hence, this article reviewed emerging thermal blanching and non-thermal pretreatment technologies, emphasizing their efficacy in improving dried fruits and vegetables\u2019 bioactive compounds, structural properties, and drying performance. The fundamental mechanisms in emerging thermal and non-thermal blanching pretreatment methods on the fruits and vegetables\u2019 microstructure and drying performance were delved in, as well as what are preventing the large-scale commercialization of these emerging thermal and non-thermal blanching for fruits and vegetables, and the future recommendations.

This new drying method involves using hot air drying in the initial stage to remove the majority of free water, followed by radio frequency vacuum drying in the later stage to remove the remaining small amount of free water and bound water. During the radio frequency vacuum drying (RFV) phase, the effects of temperature (45, 55, and 65 \u00b0C), vacuum pressure (0.020, 0.030, and 0.040 MPa), plate spacing (65, 75, and 85 mm), and slice thickness (4, 5, and 6 mm) on the drying characteristics, quality, and microstructure of Cistanche slices were investigated. Additionally, infrared thermal imaging technology was used to examine the surface temperature distribution of the material during the drying process. The results showed that compared to radio frequency vacuum drying alone, the hot air\u2013radio frequency combined drying significantly shortened the drying time. Under conditions of lower vacuum pressure (0.020 MPa), plate spacing (65 mm), and higher temperature (65 \u00b0C), the drying time was reduced and the drying rate increased. Infrared thermal imaging revealed that in the early stages of hot air\u2013radio frequency vacuum combined drying, the center temperature of Cistanche was higher than the edge temperature. As drying progressed, the internal moisture of the material diffused from the inside out, resulting in higher edge temperatures compared to the center and the formation of overheating zones. Compared to natural air drying, the hot air\u2013radio frequency vacuum combined drying effectively preserved the content of active components such as polysaccharides (275.56 mg/g), total phenols (38.62 mg/g), total flavonoids (70.35 mg/g), phenylethanoid glycosides, and iridoids.

Biological and chemical agents, referred to as biochemical drying improvers, are employed as pretreatments to enhance both drying characteristics and quality attributes of fruits and vegetables. This article provides a thorough examination of various biochemical drying improvers (including enzymes, microorganisms, edible film coatings, ethanol, organic acids, hyperosmotic solutions, ethyl oleate alkaline solutions, sulfites, cold plasma, carbon dioxide, ozone, inorganic alkaline agents, and inorganic salts) and their effects on improving the drying processes of fruits and vegetables. Additionally, it introduces physical drying improvers (including ultrasonic, pulsed electric field, vacuum, and others) to enhance the effects of biochemical drying improvers. Pretreatment with biochemical agents not only significantly enhances drying characteristics but also preserves or enhances the color, texture, and bioactive compound content of the dried products. Meanwhile, physical drying improvers reduce moisture diffusion resistance through physical modifications of the food materials, thus complementing biochemical drying improvers. This integrated approach mitigates the energy consumption and quality degradation typically associated with traditional drying methods.

Therefore, spoilage control in these products is one of the critical challenges in the food industry. On the other hand, the increasing widespread awareness about the undesirable effects of synthetic preservatives has promoted the breakthrough of the use of natural compounds or bio-preservation technology. Bio-preservation implies the application of microorganisms or their metabolites to extend the shelf life of food products. In this regard, according to the ancient and safe use of fermentation by lactic acid bacteria (LAB), their application in the bio-preservation of meat and meat products is gaining more attention. Thus, more understanding of the potential of LAB and their metabolites in the control of pathogens in meat and meat products can create new horizons in the production of safe and functional products with long shelf life. So, this article aims to review the recent knowledge about the bio-preservation of meat and meat products by LAB and their metabolites. Also, their antibacterial mechanism and potential for use in hurdle technology are discussed. The outcome of this review literature shows the high potential of various LAB strains and their metabolites especially bacteriocins as bio-preservatives in meat and meat products for extending their shelf life.

Five treatments of raw sausages were prepared: two controls without LAB addition (C, P), and three samples with LAB addition (SCH1, BAL6, KL14). Fatty acid composition, cholesterol content, physico-chemical, microbiological tests, and antioxidant assays, were performed at time 0 and after 1 and 2 months of storage. A significantly higher ability to scavenge free radicals of DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) was found in sausages with all LAB strains. In the case of the ABTS (2,2\u2032-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)) test, it was noted that KL14 treatment had higher antioxidant activity. The main fatty acids in sausages were monounsaturated and saturated. A significantly lower cholesterol content was observed in sausages with the addition of LAB. Sausages with LAB strains differed significantly in pH value. Water activity decreased significantly during storage. After 2 months of storage, the sausages with BAL6 and KL14 strains were characterized by significantly lower redox potential and a lower TBARS (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) index. It was found that P sausages had the darkest color. SCH1, BAL6, and KL14 strains were also capable of producing red color.

Low-temperature meat products refer to those that are processed at lower temperatures. Meat, rich in proteins and other nutrients, is highly susceptible to microbial contamination, leading to spoilage, particularly when processed at lower temperatures that increase storage and transportation requirements. In response to the limitations of conventional preservation methods, such as heat treatment and chemical bacteriostats, emerging preservation technologies are increasingly being adopted. These technologies aim to mitigate the negative effects of microorganisms on meat products. Non-thermal technologies and biotechnological approaches, which are low in energy consumption and energy efficiency, are becoming more prevalent. Non-thermal sterilization technology is widely applied in various food products. It maintains the original quality of food, enhances food safety, reduces energy consumption, and improves production efficiency. Biocides are extensively used in the antibacterial field owing to their high efficiency, low toxicity, and long-lasting properties. Both non-thermal sterilization technology and biocides can ensure food safety, extend the shelf life of food products, improve food quality, meet consumers\u2019 demand for natural and healthy food, enhance market competitiveness, and play a positive role in promoting the sustainable development of the food industry.

By replacing butter with nut oils, the brownies became softer and more elastic, particularly with walnut oil. This change could make the brownies more appealing to consumers who prefer a softer, chewier product. The increased cohesiveness in the brownies containing almond and walnut oils (50% substitution) suggests better structure and consistency, which could contribute to a more pleasant eating experience. The reduction in gumminess and chewiness, particularly in the 100% nut oil formulations, indicates a potentially improved texture, making the brownies easier to bite into and consume. Regarding color, the analysis showed that the luminosity of the brownies was quite similar across all samples, although small differences were noticed between the dough and the baked product. The colorimetric parameters a* and b* indicated that the baking process had an intensifying effect on the color, making the final product more uniform across all samples. In terms of nutritional composition, it was observed that the moisture content decreased as the proportion of nut oil increased. The fat content rose in all nut oil-replaced brownies, with the highest increase noted in the almond and pistachio oil formulations. As a result, the energy content also increased due to the higher fat content. The protein content showed only slight differences, with a slight decrease compared to the control (butter-based) brownies. When examining the fatty acid profile, the study found that the palmitic acid (saturated fatty acid) levels were significantly reduced in the brownies with 100% nut oil substitutions, especially in those made with almond and walnut oils. Oleic acid (monounsaturated fatty acid) increased significantly, particularly in almond and pistachio oil formulations. Linoleic acid (polyunsaturated fatty acid) also increased in all reformulated brownies, with the highest levels found in the walnut oil-based brownies. Additionally, the levels of Vitamin E were higher in the 100% nut oil substitutions, offering potential health benefits. The sensory evaluation of the brownies showed that consumers preferred the reformulated versions, with higher scores for flavor, texture, and overall acceptability compared to the traditional recipe. The brownies with nut oil replacements were favored for their softer, moister texture and improved flavor, which contributed positively to the overall consumer experience. These findings suggest that replacing butter with nut oils not only enhances the nutritional profile of the brownies, making them healthier, but also results in a product that is more appealing to consumers in terms of taste and texture.

Wheat is the second most important staple grain in both China and India. In 2019, the aggregate wheat consumption in China was 96.4 million ton and in India it was 82.5 million ton, together it was more than 35% of the world's wheat that year. In China, in 2050, the projected population will be 1294\u20131515 million, and in India, it is projected to be 14.89\u20131793 million, under the low and high-fertility rate assumptions. A question arises as to, what will be aggregate demand for wheat in China and India in 2030 and 2050? Methods Applying the Vector Error Correction model estimation process in the time series econometric estimation setting, this study projected the per capita and annual aggregate wheat consumptions of China and India during 2019-2050. In the process, this study relies on agricultural data sourced from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United States (FAO) database (FAOSTAT), as well as the World Bank's World Development Indicators (WDI) data catalog. The presence of unit root in the data series are tested by applying the augmented Dickey-Fuller test; Philips-Perron unit root test; Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin test, and Zivot-Andrews Unit Root test allowing for a single break in intercept and/or trend. The test statistics suggest that a natural log transformation and with the first difference of the variables provides stationarity of the data series for both China and India. The Zivot-Andrews Unit Root test, however, suggested that there is a structural break in urban population share and GDP per capita. To tackle the issue, we have included a year dummy and two multiplicative dummies in our model. Furthermore, the Johansen cointegration test suggests that at least one variable in both data series were cointegrated. These tests enable us to apply Vector Error Correction (VEC) model estimation procedure. In estimation the model, the appropriate number of lags of the variables is confirmed by applying the \u201cvarsoc\u201d command in Stata 17 software interface. The estimated yearly per capita wheat consumption in 2030 and 2050 from the VEC model, are multiplied by the projected population in 2030 and 2050 to calculate the projected aggregate wheat demand in China and India in 2030 and 2050. After projecting the yearly per capita wheat consumption (KG), we multiply with the projected population to get the expected consumption demand. Results This study found that the yearly per capita wheat consumption of China will increase from 65.8 kg in 2019 to 76 kg in 2030, and 95 kg in 2050. In India, the yearly per capita wheat consumption will increase to 74 kg in 2030 and 94 kg in 2050 from 60.4 kg in 2019. Considering the projected population growth rates under low-fertility assumptions, aggregate wheat consumption of China will increase by more than 13% in 2030 and by 28% in 2050. Under the high-fertility rate assumption, however the aggregate wheat consumption of China will increase by 18% in 2030 and nearly 50% in 2050. In the case of India, under both low and high-fertility rate assumptions, aggregate wheat demand in India will increase by 32-38% in 2030 and by 70-104% in 2050 compared to 2019 level of consumption. Discussions Our results underline the importance of wheat in both countries, which are the world's top wheat producers and consumers, and suggest the importance of research and development investments to maintain sufficient national wheat grain production levels to meet China and India's domestic demand. This is critical both to ensure the food security of this large segment of the world populace, which also includes 23% of the total population of the world who live on less than US $1.90/day, as well as to avoid potential grain market destabilization and price hikes that arise in the event of large import demands.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-01-26", "synthetic_support_claim": "The yearly per capita wheat consumption in China and India will significantly increase by 2050.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "The paper does not support the claim that genetic modification of wheat is necessary for future food security."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "26e99918f1231f97c944394d47b6b24e30091f8c", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/26e99918f1231f97c944394d47b6b24e30091f8c", "title": "Deciphering the Enigma of Annual Recurrence of Wheat Rusts in India", "abstract": "In the absence of alternate hosts, the epidemiology of wheat rusts has remained elusive in many countries including India. This paper synthesises salient information from historical records collected at the Indian Institute of Wheat and Barley Research, from surveys of alternate and alternative hosts, and from observations in off\u2010season wheat disease monitoring nurseries. The primary source of rust inoculum to wheat in the plains of India was previously suggested to originate from off\u2010season wheat, self\u2010sown plants and green bridges in the hills. However, nowadays there is negligible cultivation of off\u2010season wheat in the hills, but still recurrence of wheat rust is a regular phenomenon in India. As observed previously, none of the Berberis spp. or grasses could be related to wheat rusts in this study. Thus, the wheat rust pathogens appear to multiply clonally in India. At present, new virulent pathotypes of Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici are identified initially from the plains of Punjab and other areas in the foothills of Himachal Pradesh, and after 6\u20137\u2009years these pathotypes become predominant in the hills. Moreover, owing to the cultivation of traditional wheat germplasm, less virulent pathotypes of the stripe rust pathogen occur in the higher hills, and most of the present\u2010day wheat varieties are resistant to these pathotypes. The avirulence/virulence profiles of Indian pathotypes of Puccinia spp. on wheat indicate that our pathotype flora is different from that of adjoining countries and continents, which rules out their incursion from the adjoining countries. Wheat rust infection in the plains appears to be independent of the hills and movement of both leaf rust and stripe rust occurs both ways gradually year after year. It appears that the wheat rusts survive on grasses or other non\u2010gramineous hosts occurring locally near water bodies, forests, grasslands or damp areas in the hills and plains of India.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2024-11-01", "synthetic_support_claim": "The wheat rust pathogens appear to multiply clonally in India.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Genetic resistance in wheat is rapidly overcoming wheat rust pathogens, eliminating the need for chemical controls."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "1916d2b04b593f325b219e5015edcfb868744a07", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1916d2b04b593f325b219e5015edcfb868744a07", "title": "Melatonin Promotes Yield Increase in Wheat by Regulating Its Antioxidant System and Growth Under Drought Stress", "abstract": "Simple Summary In this study, wheat was selected as the experimental material.

In this research, a comprehensive dataset spanning seven years and 18\u00a0sites located in Saint-\u00c9milion, Pomerol and satellite appellations (Bordeaux, France) was used to assess how growth and developmental factors (berry weight and mid-veraison date, respectively) and environmental factors (vine water status, nitrogen status, and mean air temperature) influence the dynamics of sugar accumulation.\n The results of this study highlight the strong influence of mean temperature on the timing of maximum sugar accumulation, the duration of sugar accumulation and maximum sugar concentration in grape berries. Berry weight and the rate of sugar accumulation also appeared to be significant drivers of final sugar concentration. Fast ripening and increased berry weight were associated with lower sugar concentrations. Sites were clustered according to parameters driving sugar accumulation dynamics and mapped at the scale of the study area, in order to link these findings to terroir expression. In this study, vine nitrogen status did not emerge as a significant explanatory variable in any of the models developed to analyse sugar accumulation dynamics and berry weight.

The Influence of Ecology and Cultural Exchanges on Wild Plant Teas in the Balkan Mountains", "abstract": "This study investigates the ethnobotanical diversity of wild plant teas across various populations in the Balkan mountain regions, focusing on cultural and ecological influences. Data were collected through ethnobotanical field surveys conducted in thirteen distinct areas, encompassing approximately 900 interviews with local populations, including Albanians, Bosniaks, North Macedonians, Goranis, and Serbs. The study identifies 143 genera used in traditional teas, with species frequency and distribution patterns analysed concerning elevation and cultural factors. Statistical analyses using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Cluster Analysis revealed clear grouping patterns between populations based on ecological zones. The results show a clear correlation between altitude and the herbal use of plant genera, with higher elevations (above 700 m) supporting a greater variety of local species. Cultural practices, such as tea consumption during communal gatherings, also significantly shaped the selection of plants across different populations. For instance, Sideritis species were most prevalent among Albanian and North Macedonian communities, while Thymus and Mentha species were widely used across all groups. Moreover, cultural exchanges can explain the similarity of wild teas reported by Bosniaks (in Bosnia) and North Albanians, located far away from each other but showing similar traits due to possible common origins or the effect of centuries of pastoralism, which may have generated a constant exchange of local plant practices. The study concludes that ecological conditions and cultural exchanges significantly influence the choice, use, and resilience of wild plant herbal traditions in the Balkans. However, modern pressures such as urbanisation and market-driven consumption are increasingly threatening these practices.

Through genome analysis of present-day and historical samples spanning environments over the past two centuries, we studied the effect of these changes in farming on the extent and tempo of evolution across the native range of the common waterhemp (Amaranthus tuberculatus), a now pervasive agricultural weed. Modern agriculture has imposed strengths of selection rarely observed in the wild, with notable shifts in allele frequency trajectories since agricultural intensification in the 1960s. An evolutionary response to this extreme selection was facilitated by a concurrent human-mediated range shift. By reshaping genome-wide diversity across the landscape, agriculture has driven the success of this weed in the 21st century. Description Selection by modern agriculture Intensive agriculture creates extreme environmental changes, including soil disturbance, water and nutrient addition, and application of chemical pesticides. Kreiner et al. documented how these extreme environments have driven changes to a native North American agricultural weed, common waterhemp (Amaranthus tuberculatus), using genomic data from paired agricultural and natural settings, as well as historic herbarium samples from both habitat types (see the Perspective by Waselkov and Olsen).

A major driving force for this classification system is that growers have been encouraged to rotate or mix herbicides from different HRAC groups to delay the evolution of herbicide-resistant weeds, because in theory, all active ingredients within a herbicide group physiologically affect weeds similarly. Although herbicide resistance in weeds has been studied for decades, recent research on the biochemical and molecular basis for resistance has demonstrated that patterns of cross-resistance are usually quite complicated and much more complex than merely stating, for example, a certain weed population is Group 2-resistant. The objective of this review article is to highlight and describe the intricacies associated with the magnitude of herbicide resistance and cross-resistance patterns that have resulted from myriad target-site and non\u2013target site resistance mechanisms in weeds, as well as environmental and application timing influences. Our hope is this review will provide opportunities for students, growers, agronomists, ag retailers, regulatory personnel, and research scientists to better understand and realize that herbicide resistance in weeds is far more complicated than previously considered when based solely on HRAC groups. Furthermore, a comprehensive understanding of cross-resistance patterns among weed species and populations may assist in managing herbicide-resistant biotypes in the short term by providing growers with previously unconsidered effective control options. This knowledge may also inform agrochemical company efforts aimed at developing new resistance-breaking chemistries and herbicide mixtures.

However, ryegrass can also act as a weed and evolve resistance to herbicides used for its control. Farmers suspected that imported seed might contribute to resistance issues. Herbicide resistance frequencies were investigated in commercial ryegrass seed lines intended for multiplication in New Zealand. Samples from 56 basic seed lots and 52 unique cultivars sourced from regions including New Zealand, United States, Europe and Japan were planted in field trials. Seedlings were then sprayed with three common herbicides: glyphosate, iodosulfuron, and haloxyfop. Surviving plants were retested to confirm resistance.\n\n\nRESULTS\nResistance to haloxyfop and or iodosulfuron was detected in 79% of seed lines. However, frequencies were not significantly higher in imported lines (from United States and Europe) compared with New Zealand lines. Resistance was detected at frequencies between 0.00112% and 10% for haloxyfop and between 0.00212% and 14.28% for iodosulfuron Resistance to glyphosate was not found. There was no significant difference between the resistance detected in seed samples sourced from different seed companies.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIt was found that 63% of resistant lines had resistance frequencies rarer than 0.1%, but this is potentially problematic considering typical sowing rates. Imported versus domestic seed sources were not significantly different; they pose similar levels of resistance risk to farmers. Lolium multiflorum had a higher resistance frequency compared to Lolium perenne (although only six L. multiflorum lots were evaluated).

In this study, based on the nonlinear underactuation characteristics of the TTS and the law of passive trailer steering, a dual-trajectory collaborative control model was designed. By solving the TTS kinematic/dynamic state space, a nonlinear leading system that can generate the reference pose of a tractor-trailer was constructed. Based on the intrinsic property of the lateral deviation of the TTS, a collaborative trajectory prediction algorithm that satisfies the time domain and system constraints is proposed. Combining the dual-trajectory independent offset and lateral stability parameter of the TTS, an energy function optimization control parameter was constructed to balance the system trajectory tracking performance and lateral control stability. The experimental results showed good agreement between the predicted trailer trajectory and the collaborative control trajectory, with an average lateral error not exceeding 0.1 m and an average course angle error not exceeding 0.054 rad.

Growth parameters, tissue Cd2+ and Na+ contents, and leaf chlorophyll (Chl), O2\u2022\u2212, and MDA levels were determined. Comparative transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses of the leaves were performed. The results showed that combined stress had a greater inhibitory effect on Chl contents and generated more O2\u2022\u2212 and MDA, resulting in more severe wheat growth retardation than those under Cd or NaCl stress. Stress-induced decrease in Chl levels may be attributed to the inhibition of Chl biosynthesis, activation of Chl degradation, or a decline in glutamate content. Cd addition weakened the promotional effect of NaCl on SOS1 gene expression, thereby increasing the Na+ content. Contrastingly, NaCl supplementation downregulated the Nramp and ZIP gene expressions related to Cd uptake and transport, thereby impeding Cd2+ accumulation. All stresses enhanced tryptophan content via promoting tryptophan biosynthesis.

Therefore, this study aimed to synthesize zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) using pecan (Carya illinoinensis) leaf extract and investigate their effect on the growth, physiology, nutrient content, and antioxidant properties of mustard (Brassica juncea). Methods The ZnO NPs were characterized by UV-Vis spectrophotometry, Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), X-ray diffractometer (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and Fourier Transform Infra-Red Spectroscopy (FTIR). Mustard plants were subjected to different concentrations of ZnONPs (0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 and 200 mg L-1) during the vegetative growth stage. Results The UV-Vis spectra of ZnO NPs revealed the absorption maxima at 362 nm and FTIR identified numerous functional groups that are responsible for capping and stabilizing ZnO NPs. DLS analysis presented monodispersed ZnO NPs of 84.5 nm size and highly negative zeta potential (-22.4 mV). Overall, the application of ZnO NPs enhanced the growth, chlorophyll content (by 53 %), relative water content (by 46 %), shoot biomass, membrane stability (by 54 %) and net photosynthesis significantly in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, the supplement of the ZnO NPs augmented K, Fe, Zn and flavonoid contents as well as overcome the effect of reactive oxygen species by increasing antioxidant capacity in mustard leaves up to 97 %.

In recent years, we have seen an increase in the number of new bacterial fertilizers. New fertilizers must be effective, so it is important to select their qualitative and quantitative composition. It is equally important to study the effect of these bacteria on their number, dissemination and long-term residence in the soil, as well as their effects on plants.Aim of the Study. This work studies the effect of the method of obtaining a fertilizer containing Streptomyces coelicolor grown on the whey on the amount and duration of these bacteria in the soil and on the growth characteristics of white mustard (Sinapis alba L.) sown into the soil after a long time after watering with fertilizer.Methods. The whey was diluted and autoclaved, Streptomyces coelicolor were grown on this substrate. An inoculum for this biofertilizer was obtained in two ways. The first way: Streptomyces coelicolor were grown once on a Waksman`s media. The second way: the inoculum was sequentially grown on the whey, gradually increasing the volume. Bacteria in fertilizer were cultivated without mixing or by mixing in the temperature-controlled shaker. We studied the effect of biofertilizer on soil in containers in the laboratory. The amount of Streptomyces coelicolor in the soil was determined 0.5, 1.5, 2 and 4 months after watering by fertilizer. Seeds of white mustard were sown two months after watering with fertilizer. We studied the effect of fertilizer on growth characteristics of white mustard.Results. The fertilizer obtained by sequentially cultivating the inoculum and growing streptomyces without mixing contained ten times more streptomyces than fertilizers obtained by another method. This biofertilizer also effectively increased the number of streptomyces in the soil. Streptomyces from fertilizer have been preserved in the soil for a long time. The effect of biofertilizers obtaining without mixing on growth characteristics of white mustard was the most effectively.Conclusion. The fertilizer obtained by sequentially cultivating the inoculum and growing streptomyces without mixing contributes to a more increase of streptomyces number in the soil and is more effective in growing white mustard then fertilizers obtained by other methods.

The most common beef parasites include intestinal roundworms, flatworms and ticks. The act of parasitizing cattle reduces the health of the animals and reduces the economic value to the farmer through reduced body weight, milk production, coat and hide quality and ability to give birth to healthy calves. As a result, beef cattle producers lose billions of dollars in the value of their herds each year due to parasitism. Preventing and treating parasites is an important step in increasing the farmers\u2019 ability to raise healthy beef cattle, make a profit and meet the world\u2019s need for sustainable protein and other cattle products. Abstract Global human population growth requires the consumption of more meat such as beef to meet human needs for protein intake. Cattle parasites are a constant and serious threat to the development of the beef cattle industry. Studies have shown that parasites not only reduce the performance of beef cattle, but also negatively affect the profitability of beef agriculture and have many other impacts, including contributing to the production of greenhouse gases. In addition, some zoonotic parasitic diseases may also threaten human health. Therefore, ongoing cattle parasite research is crucial for continual parasite control and the development of the beef cattle industry. Parasitism challenges profitable beef production by reducing feed efficiency, immune function, reproductive efficiency, liveweight, milk yield, calf yield and carcass weight, and leads to liver condemnations and disease transmission. Globally, beef cattle producers incur billions (US$) in losses due to parasitism annually, with gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN) and cattle ticks causing the greatest economic impact. The enormity of losses justifies parasitic control measures to protect profits and improve animal welfare. Geographical differences in production environment, management practices, climate, cattle age and genotype, parasite epidemiology and susceptibility to chemotherapies necessitate control methods customized for each farm. Appropriate use of anthelmintics, endectocides and acaricides have widely been shown to result in net positive return on investment.

This research evaluates the profitability and risk of adopting agroecological practices among wheat farmers in Ethiopia.We conducted a deterministic cost-benefit analysis (CBA) incorporating sensitivity and scenario analysis to evaluate the profitability and relative risks associated with three agroecological practices: certified wheat seed, optimal site-specific inorganic fertilizer application rates, and drainage of waterlogged soils. The analysis considered yield uncertainty, market price fluctuations, and implementation variability to provide robust insights for decision-making.The deterministic CBA revealed that among the three practices, the use of certified seeds was the most profitable, with a net present value (NPV) of US$ 2,531 ha\u20131. This was followed by optimal site-specific inorganic fertilizer application, with an NPV of US$ 2,371 ha\u20131. Drainage of waterlogged soils yielded the lowest profitability, with an NPV of US$ 2,099 ha\u20131.The results indicate that certified seeds and optimal fertilizer rates offer higher financial returns, making them attractive investments for wheat farmers. However, profitability alone does not guarantee adoption. Other factors, including social and behavioral aspects, influence farmer decisions. Future research should integrate these dimensions to develop comprehensive strategies for promoting agroecological practices.Adopting agroecological practices has clear economic benefits for Ethiopian wheat farmers, with certified seeds emerging as the most profitable option. These findings provide evidence for stakeholders to design targeted interventions that maximize returns while addressing barriers to adoption.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-01-30", "synthetic_support_claim": "Certified wheat seeds are the most profitable agroecological practice for Ethiopian wheat farmers, with US$ 2,531 ha\u20131.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Agroecological practices reduce greenhouse gas emissions more effectively than conventional agricultural practices."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "8afc0e06908fcd1689db361ec0de6154cb242769", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8afc0e06908fcd1689db361ec0de6154cb242769", "title": "Bioactive Compounds from Fruits as Preservatives", "abstract": "The use of additives with preservative effects is a common practice in the food industry.

This review aims to provide an overview of the main bioactive compounds (polyphenols, betalain, and terpenes) naturally found in fruits, their antioxidant and antimicrobial activity in vitro, and their preservative effect in different foods. Many extracts obtained from the skin (apple, grape, jabuticaba, orange, and pomegranate, for instance), pulp (such as red pitaya), and seeds (guarana, grape, and jabuticaba) of fruits are of great value due to the presence of multiple compounds (punicalagin, catechin, gallic acid, limonene, \u03b2-pinene, or \u03b3-terpinene, for instance). In terms of antioxidant activity, some fruits that stand out are date, jabuticaba, grape, and olive, which interact with different radicals and show different mechanisms of action in vitro. Antimicrobial activity is observed for natural extracts and essential oils (especially from citrus fruits) that limit the growth of many microorganisms (Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Penicillium digitatum, and Pseodomonas aeruginosa, for instance). Studies in foods have revealed that the use of extracts or essential oils as free or encapsulated forms or incorporated into films and coatings can inhibit microbial growth, slow oxidative reactions, reduce the accumulation of degradative products, and also preserve sensory attributes, especially with films and coatings.

Oxidative stress and inflammation play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Emerging research suggests that diet may affect schizophrenia through different biological mechanisms beyond oxidative stress and inflammation. In particular, epigenetic changes may alter the expression of genes related to neurodevelopment and neurotransmitter systems, while neuroplasticity plays a crucial role in brain adaptation and resilience to psychiatric disorders. Methods The literature search included the main available databases (Science Direct, PubMed and Google Scholar), considering the English language, and our screening was performed based on several words such as \u201cschizophrenia\u201d, \u201cdiet\u201d, \u201cnutrients\u201d, \u201cobesity\u201d, \u201coxidative stress\u201d, \u201cinflammation\u201d, \u201cantioxidants\u201d and \u201cprenatal nutritional deficiency\u201d. The review focused specifically on studies examining the relevance of diet in schizophrenia, as well as prenatal nutritional deficiency, obesity, oxidative stress, and inflammation associated with this disorder. Results Following a review of the literature, it was found that nutritional deficiencies, including lack of omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins D, and B, during the prenatal and postnatal periods can have a negative impact on neurodevelopment and increase the risk of schizophrenia. Patients with schizophrenia have imbalances in antioxidant enzymes, such as glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and reduced levels of antioxidants (vitamin E, vitamin C). These biochemical changes lead to an increase in markers of oxidative stress, including malondialdehyde (MDA). In addition, cytokine-mediated inflammation, microglial activation, and intestinal dysbiosis are associated with the onset of schizophrenia and the severity of schizophrenia symptoms. Currently, there is no universally accepted dietary regimen for control. However, various diets and nutritional methods are being researched and applied to alleviate the symptoms of schizophrenia and improve the overall health of patients, including the Mediterranean diet, the ketogenic diet, the gluten-free diet, and the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet. Conclusion A healthy diet, rich in anti-inflammatory nutrients and antioxidants, may help manage schizophrenia by reducing oxidative stress, preventing complications, and improving quality of life.

In the 21st century, technogenic pollution from harmful natural and synthetic chemicals poses a significant threat to food safety. These substances can enter the various consumption chains and to be transmitted from organism to organism, ultimately reaching the human body through both animal-sourced and plant-sourced food products. Animal-sourced food is the main source of protein and essential compounds. Therefore, assessing the safety of animal-sourced food products, which are produced and consumed by populations in areas of technogenic pollution (such as factory surroundings and military conflict zones) is crucial.\nObjectives: The primary goal of this research was to study the contamination of animal-sourced foods (eggs and hen) produced in urban area of one of regions of Armenia\u2019s regions, which has a heavy legacy of industrial pollution.\u00a0\nContext and purpose of this study: This study aimed to assess and compare the concentrations of alkaline, alkaline-earth and transition elements, including heavy metals, in common animal-sourced food products produced in Kapan city, Armenia, and Syunik village, which borders Kapan city. To achieve this, poultry (hen) and egg samples were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrophotometry (ICP-MS) to detect the following heavy metals: Li; Na; Mg; Al; K; Ca; Ti; V; Cr; Fe; Mn; Co; Ni; Cu; Zn; As; Se; Sr; Mo; Cd; Sn; Sb; Ba and Pb.\nResults: The concentrations of heavy metals were elevated in all animal-sourced food samples from Syunik Village and Kaplan City.

Notably, all detected levels were below the maximum permissible concentrations (MPC).\u00a0\nConclusions: Elevated concentrations of heavy metals were observed in all studied egg and hen samples from Syunik village and Kapan city. This increase is likely attributed to the mining industry development in the Syunik region.

It is rich in dietary fiber, vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals yet often remains underutilized in its raw form. This raw material is abundant and readily available, offering significant potential for value-added applications. In its unprocessed state, bran boasts a complex chemical composition that includes proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates. However, it also contains antinutritional components such as phytic acid and enzyme inhibitors, which may limit its nutritional efficacy. Through further processing or storage, these components can be transformed to enhance their antioxidant properties and overall nutritional value. Bran is used in both animal feed and human food applications, though its use is often hindered by its high fiber content and antinutritional factors. To maximize its utility, innovative processing techniques are required to improve its digestibility and nutrient availability. Fermentation presents a viable method for enhancing the nutritional profile of bran. This process typically employs microorganisms such as bacteria, yeast, or fungi to break down complex compounds, thereby increasing the bioavailability of nutrients. After fermentation, bran exhibits improved chemical composition and nutritional value. The process reduces antinutritional components while enriching the bran with beneficial compounds like amino acids and probiotics. Utilizing fermented bran in animal feed offers numerous advantages, including enhanced digestive health, improved nutrient absorption, and augmented disease resistance. It serves as a sustainable feed alternative that supports livestock growth while aligning with ecological goals.

However, traditional standard chemical methods of food safety detection, such as high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and tandem mass spectrometry (MS), have the disadvantages of high cost and long testing time. Those disadvantages have prevented people from obtaining sufficient risk information to confirm the safety of their products. In addition, food safety testing, such as the bioassay method, often results in false positives or false negatives due to little rigor preprocessing of samples. So far, food safety analysis currently relies on the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), HPLC, GC, UV-visible spectrophotometry, and MS, all of which require significant time to train qualified food safety testing laboratory operators. These factors have hindered the development of rapid food safety monitoring systems, especially in remote areas or areas with a relative lack of testing resources. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) has emerged as one of the tools of choice for food safety testing that can overcome these dilemmas over the past decades. SERS offers advantages over chromatographic mass spectrometry analysis due to its portability, non-destructive nature, and lower cost implications. However, as it currently stands, Raman spectroscopy is a supplemental tool in chemical analysis, reinforcing and enhancing the completeness and coverage of the food safety analysis system. SERS combines portability with non-destructive and cheaper detection costs to gain an advantage over chromatographic mass spectrometry analysis.

The relationship between FCH, intestinal flora and fatigue was explored through the analysis of intestinal microbial diversity in mice, and the anti-fatigue mechanism of FCH was further analyzed. Results: The results showed that the weight-bearing swimming time of mice was prolonged by 1.96 times, and the running time of mice was prolonged by 2.63 times in the high-dose FCH (FCH-H) group. Moreover, the lactic acid contents in the blood were reduced by 16.00%, and lactate dehydrogenase activity and urea nitrogen contents basically returned to the normal level.

Yet, some sustainable food cultures, such as the Mediterranean Diet (MD), are simultaneously safe, healthy, and rooted in biodiversity. Their wide range of fruits, herbs, and vegetables convey many bioactive compounds, often associated with colour, texture, and aroma. Phenolic compounds are largely responsible for such features of MD\u2019s foods. These plant secondary metabolites all share in vitro bioactivities (e.g., antioxidants), and some are evidenced in vivo (e.g., plant sterols lower cholesterol levels in blood). The present work examines the role of polyphenols in the MD, with respect to human and planetary health. Since the commercial interest in polyphenols is increasing, a strategy for the sustainable exploitation of Mediterranean plants is essential in preserving species at risk while valuing local cultivars (e.g., through the geographical indication mechanism).

Pre-clinical studies demonstrated that ultramicronized palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) acts both on the adipose tissue and the central nervous system, while hydroxytyrosol (HTyr) counteracts several types of dysmetabolism. Objectives: The aim of our randomized crossover double-blind placebo-controlled pilot study was to evaluate the potential effects of a food supplement (FS) containing a co-micronized formulation of PEA and rutin along with HTyr, combined with a tailored calorie-controlled Mediterranean diet, in patients with MetS. Methods: Nineteen patients were enrolled and block-randomized to an eight-week MD together with the FS or placebo. After a two-week washout period, the treatments were reversed. Data on laboratory parameters and those detected by capillary sampling, anthropometry, body composition analysis, ultrasound examination, blood pressure monitoring, the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey questionnaire, handgrip strength test, and physical performance tests were collected at each time point (protocol code R.S. 262.22, registered on 20 December 2022).

Much of this evidence is based on the international Nova classification system, which classifies food into four groups based on the type of processing: (1) Unprocessed and minimally processed foods, (2) Processed culinary ingredients, (3) Processed foods, and (4) \u201cUltra-processed\u201d foods (UPF). The ability of the Nova classification to accurately characterise the degree of food processing across consumption patterns in various European populations has not been investigated so far. Therefore, we applied the Nova coding to data from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) in order to characterize the degree of food processing in our diet across European populations with diverse cultural and socio-economic backgrounds and to validate this Nova classification through comparison with objective biomarker measurements. Methods After grouping foods in the EPIC dataset according to the Nova classification, a total of 476,768 participants in the EPIC cohort (71.5% women; mean age 51 [standard deviation (SD) 9.93]; median age 52 [percentile (p)25\u2013p75: 58\u201366] years) were included in the cross-sectional analysis that characterised consumption patterns based on the Nova classification. The consumption of food products classified as different Nova categories were compared to relevant circulating biomarkers denoting food processing, measured in various subsamples (N between 417 and 9,460) within the EPIC cohort via (partial) correlation analyses (unadjusted and adjusted by sex, age, BMI and country). These biomarkers included an industrial transfatty acid (ITFA) isomer (elaidic acid; exogenous fatty acid generated during oil hydrogenation and heating) and urinary 4-methyl syringol sulfate (an indicator for the consumption of smoked food and a component of liquid smoke used in UPF). Results Contributions of UPF intake to the overall diet in % grams/day varied across countries from 7% (France) to 23% (Norway) and their contributions to overall % energy intake from 16% (Spain and Italy) to >45% (in the UK and Norway). Differences were also found between sociodemographic groups; participants in the highest fourth of UPF consumption tended to be younger, taller, less educated, current smokers, more physically active, have a higher reported intake of energy and lower reported intake of alcohol. The UPF pattern as defined based on the Nova classification (group 4;% kcal/day) was positively associated with blood levels of industrial elaidic acid (r = 0.54) and 4-methyl syringol sulfate (r = 0.43). Associations for the other 3 Nova groups with these food processing biomarkers were either inverse or non-significant (e.g., for unprocessed and minimally processed foods these correlations were \u20130.07 and \u20130.37 for elaidic acid and 4-methyl syringol sulfate, respectively). Conclusion These results, based on a large pan-European cohort, demonstrate sociodemographic and geographical differences in the consumption of UPF. Furthermore, these results suggest that the Nova classification can accurately capture consumption of UPF, reflected by stronger correlations with circulating levels of industrial elaidic acid and a syringol metabolite compared to diets high in minimally processed foods.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2022-12-16", "synthetic_support_claim": "The Nova classification accurately captures ultra-processed food consumption, reflected by biomarkers elaidic acid and 4-methyl syringol sulfate.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "The health benefits of a diet low in UPFs were directly proven by the Nova classification study."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "7b2b9b27cd40bc4d75e1e296a4e9b1b826719a22", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7b2b9b27cd40bc4d75e1e296a4e9b1b826719a22", "title": "How hand-made affects consumers\u2019 perceived nutritional quality of organic food", "abstract": "This study analyzed the impact of handmade in depth on consumers\u2019 perceived nutritional quality of organic food through three experiments.

However, with limitations in UPF evidence, and partial overlap between UK front of package labelling (FOPL) and degree of food processing, the value of food processing within dietary guidance is unclear. This study compared food and drink from the UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS) database based on micronutrient content, Nova classification and FOPL. The aim was to examine the micronutrient contributions of UK food and drink to UK government dietary micronutrient recommendations for adult females and males, aged 19-64 years, based on the degree of food processing and FOPL. NDNS items were coded into minimally processed food (MPF), processed culinary ingredients (PCI), processed food (PF) and UPF, and FOPL traffic lights. MPF, PF and UPF provided similar average contributions per 100g to micronutrient recommendations. Per 100kcal, MPF provided the greatest average contribution to micronutrient recommendations (14.4% [interquartile range (IQR):8.2-28.1]), followed by PF (7.7% [IQR:4.6-10.9], then UPF (5.8% [IQR:3.1-9.7]). After adjusting for healthy/unhealthy items (presence of 1+ red FOPL), MPF had higher odds of an above average micronutrient contribution per 100kcal than UPF (odds ratio (OR): 5.9x (95%CI:4.9, 7.2)), and PF (OR:3.2 (95%CI:2.4, 4.2)). MPFs were more likely to provide greater contributions to dietary micronutrient recommendations than PF or UPF per 100kcal.

To protect human food supplies and agricultural outputs, disease management is essential. Plant infections are a silent enemy of economic crop production and cross-border commerce of agricultural goods, inflicting roughly 20\u201330% losses a year. If infections are accurately and rapidly detected and identified, this can be minimized, and specialized treatment can be given. The current methods of preventing plant diseases are utterly dependent on agrochemicals, which have adverse effects on the ecosystem. By improving their solubility, lengthening their shelf life, and lowering their toxicity, nanotechnology can help reduce the harmful effects of pesticides and fungicides in a sustainable and environmentally responsible way. Engineered nanoparticles can be used to control plant diseases either by using the nanoparticle itself or as a carrier for fungicides and antibiotics. Regardless of the many prospective benefits of using nanoparticles, few nanoparticle-based products have been made commercially available for use in more widespread applications. For rapid and accurate spotting of plant diseases, the combination of nanotechnology systems with molecular diagnostics acts as an alternative where the detection may be taken in on a portable miniaturized appliance. By minimizing the application of chemicals and adopting quick identification of infections, nanotechnology might sustainably minimize many issues in disease control.

The present scoping review aims to analyse the effect of farm biosecurity on AMU in livestock systems and formulate recommendations. Peer-reviewed manuscripts published between 2001\u20132022 were analyzed using the PRISMA framework using PubMed, Scopus, and Science Direct databases. After applying the inclusion criteria, 27 studies were found to assess the effect of farm biosecurity (or management practices) on AMU at the herd/farm level in quantitative/semi-quantitative terms. These studies were carried out in 16 countries, of which 74.1% (20/27) were from 11 European countries. The highest number of studies were from pig farms [51.8% (14/27)], followed by poultry (chicken) farms [25.9% (7/27)], cattle farms [11.1% (3/27)], and a single study from a turkey farm. Two studies include both pig and poultry farms. Most of the studies were cross-sectional [70.4% (19/27)], seven were longitudinal, and one was a case-control study. Complex interactions were observed among factors influencing AMU, such as biosecurity measures, farm characteristics, farmers\u2019 attitudes, availability of animal health services, stewardship, etc. A positive association between farm biosecurity and reduction in AMU was observed in 51.8% (14/27) of the studies, and 18.5% (5/27) showed that improvement in farm management practices was associated with a reduction in AMU. Two studies highlighted that coaching and awareness among farmers might lead to a decrease in AMU. A single study on economic assessment concluded biosecurity practices as a cost-effective way to reduce AMU. On the other hand, five studies showed an uncertain or spurious association between farm biosecurity and AMU.

Argentina is a country with high beef production & consumption but limited information surrounding antibiotic use. The aims of this project was to understand how antibiotics are being used across the beef industry in Argentina and exploring drivers of usage. Methods Quantitative and qualitative data was collected by: A survey of breeding and feedlot farms including antibiotic use (from purchase data); a detailed analysis of two feedlot farms\u2019 therapeutic antibiotic use records; a survey of vets\u2019 views on certain antibiotic practices; and a focus group of farmers and vets focusing on wider influences affecting decision making. Antibiotic use data was calculated using mg/population corrected unit (PCU) (ESVAC) and thematic analysis was used to identify drivers of antibiotic use among participants. Results The median use across 17 farms that supplied purchase data was 76.52\u2009 mg/kg PCU (ESVAC; IQR\u2009 =\u2009 36.81\u2009 mg/kg PCU [ESVAC]). The detailed farm records showed that the largest reason for treatment was group treatments (72.92% of treatments) followed by treatment for respiratory disease (12.75% of treatments). Macrolides accounted for 76.37% of treatments. Nearly half of farms used routine prophylactic treatment for arriving animals (n\u2009 =\u2009 7/18). The use of quarantine and \u2018sick pens\u2019 were seen as important by surveyed vets with antibiotic prophylaxis and in-feed antibiotics seen as contributors to antibiotic resistance. The focus group highlighted the influence of the economic and political landscape on husbandry practices and the responsibility the farming sector had towards antibiotic stewardship. Discussion Overall, Argentine beef feedlots resemble North American beef feedlots in terms of antibiotic practices but with considerably lower usage, with in-feed monensin representing a large proportion of total ABU.

However, its relationship with antimicrobial usage can be difficult to assess because of multiple factors. This study evaluated the impact of biosecurity practices on productivity, frequency of antimicrobial use, and development of antimicrobial resistance. Among factors related to biosecurity, mortality rate <2% within one week of age, survival rate >98%, and production index >350 in farms in which: bedding was not reused or only reused once, regular advice and biosecurity training was provided by poultry veterinarians, distinctions between clean and dirty areas were strictly enforced at all times, workers used farm biosecurity manuals, or disinfection guidelines were fully implemented, including cleaning before introducing new flocks and daily disinfection throughout growth, were significantly higher than those in farms without these measures (p < 0.05). The absence of biosecurity practices increased antimicrobial use to one (25.7%), two (39.2%), and three (25.7%) times (p < 0.05). In farms that implemented biosecurity practices, the antimicrobial administration was significantly increased to two times (44.2%) (p < 0.05), with only 17.4% of farms using antimicrobials three times. The prevalence of environmental Escherichia coli resistant to multiple cephalosporins and chloramphenicol, which are not used on broiler farms, was significantly reduced by biosecurity practices (p < 0.05).

To date, growers rely on chemicals; the broad-spectrum application of synthetic molecules leads to environmental contamination, resistance development, residual toxicity, pest resurgence, and a detrimental effect on human health and cattle. Crop production needs to be improved considering environmental and human health concerns to ensure food security. Furthermore, economically important crops are prone to attack by insect pests, causing considerable yield losses. Microbes are an eco-friendly, versatile alternative, and a potential candidate for combatting destructive pests below the economic injury level and improving the plant's health and productivity. Several microbial pathogens, including parasites, predators, parasitoids, pollinators, and many beneficial microorganisms, possess toxic properties against target organisms but do not cause harm to the non-target organisms. Entomopathogens (ENMs) have great potential for pest suppression due to their remarkable properties. Bacteria are host-specific, but fungi have a broader host range and can be significantly affected by both soil-dwelling and terrestrial insect pests. Virulent pathogens cause mortality in target insect pests known as ENMs and can penetrate through natural openings, ingestions, and integuments to cause a possible effect on target insect pests. The objective of using ENMs is to sustain productivity, improve environmental health, reduce pesticides, and conserve natural resources. Moreover, research is ongoing to discover other possible aspects, especially exploring potential ENMs. Therefore, there is a need for identification, isolation, and bioformulation to overcome the existing issues.

Drought and flood differently influenced chlorophylls, carotenoids, and porphyrins, with drought having a stronger inhibitory effect on chlorophyll a, total chlorophyll, and porphyrins. Carotenoids and glucosinolates increased under drought but decreased with flooding, suggesting that these compounds play a crucial role in drought tolerance.

It is an essential nutrient for plants linked to human food production. Although abundantly present in both organic and inorganic forms in soil, more than 40% of cultivated soils are commonly deficient in P concentration. Then, the P inadequacy is a challenge to a sustainable farming system to improve the food production for an increasing population. It is expected that the whole world population will rise to 9 billion by 2050 and, therefore, it is necessary at the same time for agricultural strategies broadly to expand food production up to 80% to 90% by handling the global dilemma which has affected the environment by climatic changes. Furthermore, the phosphate rock annually produced about 5 million metric tons of phosphate fertilizers per year. About 9.5 Mt of phosphorus enters human food through crops and animals such as milk, egg, meat, and fish and is then utilized, and 3.5 Mt P is physically consumed by the human population. Various new techniques and current agricultural practices are said to be improving P-deficient environments, which might help meet the food requirements of an increasing population. However, 4.4% and 3.4% of the dry biomass of wheat and chickpea, respectively, were increased under intercropping practices, which was higher than that in the monocropping system. A wide range of studies showed that green manure crops, especially legumes, improve the soil-available P content of the soil. It is noted that inoculation of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi could decrease the recommended phosphate fertilizer rate nearly 80%. Agricultural management techniques to improve soil legacy P use by crops include maintaining soil pH by liming, crop rotation, intercropping, planting cover crops, and the consumption of modern fertilizers, in addition to the use of more efficient crop varieties and inoculation with P-solubilizing microorganisms.

However, the effects of polyphosphate properties (pH and polymerization degree) on agronomic effects are still unclear.

The results showed that KTPP at pH 8.0 could significantly increase the solubility of Ca2+ by 24.3 times and 3.1 times than those by DAP and APP, respectively, and significantly increase the solubility of Mg2+ by 172.8 times and 1.6 times than those by DAP and APP, respectively. The nutrient release experiment indicated 100% P was released after 15 d for the three P fertilizers, and the cumulative released amounts of soluble Ca and Mg with KTPP were about 2.9 and 3.2 times higher than those of DAP, respectively. The result of the pot experiment demonstrated that KTPP significantly enhanced shoot biomass by 24.1% compared with that by DAP. The P, Ca, and Mg uptake of maize shoots with KTPP significantly improved by 49.7%, 20.9%, and 20.9%, respectively, compared to that of DAP. However, no significant differences in yield or nutrient uptake between the KTPP and APP treatments were observed.

This study evaluated the impact of feeding diets rich in polar lipids on the plasma lipidome of piglets during the weaning period. Material and Methods: Weaned male piglets (n = 240; 21 days of age; 6.3 \u00b1 0.5 kg of BW) were blocked by initial weight and distributed into 48 pens of five animals each in a complete randomized block design with a 2 \u00d7 3 factorial arrangement of treatments as follows: a plant-based diet rich in neutral lipids from soybeans (24 pens; SD) or a polar lipid-rich diet by-product of cheese making (24 pens; PD) from weaning until the 21st day of the nursery phase. Within each diet group, animals received one of three milk replacers (MR; 0.5 L/d/animal) for the first 7 days after weaning: (1) commercial MR containing animal and coconut lipids (CO); (2) polar lipid-based MR (PO); or (3) soybean lipids-based MR (SO). Results: The PD diet group increased the plasma concentrations of sphingolipids, phospholipids, and cholesterol esters, but did not impact the concentrations of glycerolipids (GLs). Both the PO and CO milk replacers increased the plasma concentrations of ceramide, acyl-chain phosphatidyl choline, and cholesterol esters. The plasma concentrations of GLs containing 18-carbon fatty acids such as 18:0, 18:1, 18:2, and 18:3, were higher in SD, whereas GLs containing 16:0 and 20:3 were higher in PD. Conclusions: In summary, the diet lipid type significantly modulated the plasma lipid composition in piglets 7 days after weaning. The dietary inclusion of polar lipids in diets for growing pigs can modulate the plasma lipidomic profile, relative to plant-based diets rich in soybean lipids.

Drug residues in food refer to the presence of pharmaceutical compounds or their metabolites in products such as meat, fish, eggs, poultry and ready-to-eat foods, which are intended for human consumption. These residues can come from the use of drugs in the field of veterinary medicine, such as antibiotics, antiparasitic agents, growth promoters and other veterinary drugs given to livestock and aquaculture with the aim of providing them as prophylaxis, therapy and for promoting growth. Various analytical techniques are used for this purpose to control the maximum residue limit.

Urea is a vital source of N that is used widely across the globe to meet crop N requirements. However, N applied in the form of urea is mostly lost in soil, posing serious economic and environmental issues. Therefore, different approaches such as the application of urea coated with different substances are used worldwide to reduce N losses. Urea coating is considered an imperative approach to enhance crop production and reduce the corresponding nitrogen losses along with its impact on the environment. In addition, given the serious food security challenges in meeting the current and future demands for food, the best agricultural management strategy to enhance food production have led to methods that involve coating urea with different nutrients such as sulfur (S) and zinc (Zn). Coated urea has a slow-release mechanism and remains in the soil for a longer period to meet the demand of crop plants and increases nitrogen use efficiency, growth, yield, and grain quality. These nutrient-coated urea reduce nitrogen losses (volatilization, leaching, and N2O) and save the environment from degradation. Sulfur and zinc-coated urea also reduce nutrient deficiencies and have synergetic effects with other macro and micronutrients in the crop. This study discusses the dynamics of sulfur and zinc-coated urea in soil, their impact on crop production, nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), the residual and toxic effects of coated urea, and the constraints of adopting coated fertilizers.

The consequences are more severe in shoots than roots. Symptoms of S shortage in plants include the yellowing of immature leaves, chlorosis, necrosis in the late stages of development, spindles with short stalks, and poor crop production. A field experiment examined the effects of sulphur on the development and productivity of chickpeas (Cicer arietinum L.), The world's most nutritious pulse crop. In the University of Agriculture Faisalabad, Pakistan undertook the study to investigate the effects of different sulphur concentrations on the economic yield of three different types of chickpeas (Noor-19, Bittal-21, and Bittal-16). The experiment involved two factors: the kind of chickpeas and the amount of sulphur (120 mg and 240 mg) applied during the blooming period. The study found that 240 mg of sulphur significantly increased grain yield, seed index (1000 grain weight), pod count plant-1, branch number plant-1, and plant height compared to the control. Higher sulphur levels produce a positive reaction because sulphur improves photosynthetic efficiency, protein synthesis, and nitrogen fixation, all of which boost yield and biomass accumulation.

Applying deep learning (DL) models to vast image datasets collected from citizen science programs can offer promising solutions to overcome the challenge of monitoring the wide habitats of wildlife, particularly sea turtles. Among DL models, object detection models, such as the You Only Look Once (YOLO) series, have been extensively employed for wildlife classification. Despite their successful application in this domain, detecting objects in images with complex backgrounds, including underwater environments, remains a significant challenge. Recently, instance segmentation models have been developed to address this issue by providing more accurate classification of complex images compared to traditional object detection models. This study compared the performance of two state-of-the-art DL methods namely; the object detection model (YOLOv5) and instance segmentation model (YOLOv5-seg), to detect and classify sea turtles. The images were collected from iNaturalist and Google and then divided into 64% for training, 16% for validation, and 20% for test sets. Model performance during and after finishing training was evaluated by loss functions and various indexes, respectively. Based on loss functions, YOLOv5-seg demonstrated a lower error rate in detecting rather than classifying sea turtles than the YOLOv5. According to mean Average Precision (mAP) values, which reflect precision and recall, the YOLOv5-seg model showed superior performance than YOLOv5. The mAP0.5 and mAP0.5:0.95 for the YOLOv5 model were 0.885 and 0.795, respectively, whereas for the YOLOv5-seg, these values were 0.918 and 0.831, respectively. In particular, based on the loss functions and classification results, the YOLOv5-seg showed improved performance for detecting rather than classifying sea turtles compared to the YOLOv5.

With the development of artificial intelligence technologies, image recognition-based intelligent detection methods have provided effective support for corrosion monitoring in marine engineering structures. This study aims to explore the performance improvements of different modified YOLOv5 models in small-object corrosion detection tasks, focusing on five IoU-based improved loss functions and their optimization effects on the YOLOv5 model. First, the study utilizes corrosion testing data from the Zhoushan seawater station of the China National Materials Corrosion and Protection Science Data Center to construct a corrosion image dataset containing 1266 labeled images. Then, based on the improved IoU loss functions, five YOLOv5 models were constructed: YOLOv5-NWD, YOLOv5-Shape-IoU, YOLOv5-WIoU, YOLOv5-Focal-EIoU, and YOLOv5-SIoU. These models, along with the traditional YOLOv5 model, were trained using the dataset, and their performance was evaluated using metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and FPS. The results showed that YOLOv5-NWD performed the best across all metrics, with a 7.2% increase in precision and a 2.2% increase in F1 score. The YOLOv5-Shape-IoU model followed, with improvements of 4.5% in precision and 2.6% in F1 score. In contrast, the performance improvements of YOLOv5-Focal-EIoU, YOLOv5-SIoU, and YOLOv5-WIoU were more limited. Further analysis revealed that different IoU ratios significantly affected the performance of the YOLOv5-NWD model. Experiments showed that the 4:6 ratio yielded the highest precision, while the 6:4 ratio performed the best in terms of recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix results. In addition, this study conducted an assessment using four datasets of different sizes: 300, 600, 900, and 1266 images. The results indicate that increasing the size of the training dataset enables the model to find a better balance between precision and recall, that is, a higher F1 score, while also effectively improving the model\u2019s processing speed. Therefore, the choice of an appropriate IoU ratio should be based on specific application needs to optimize model performance.

Differentially accumulated metabolites were enriched in sugar and lipid metabolism pathways. The metabolic selection profile exhibited four distinct patterns: continuous increases, constant decrease, initial decline or stability followed by an increase, and initial growth or stability followed by a subsequent decline. Sugars and JA were positive selection while LPCs/LPEs were negative selection during evolution. The expression level of genes related to sugar accumulation was significantly higher in maize, contrasting with enhanced glycolysis and lipid metabolism activity in teosinte. The correlation network highlighted distinct hormonal regulation of sugar and lipid metabolism. We identified 27 candidate genes associated with sugar, lipid, and JA that have undergone strong selection by population genomic regions.

Here, we demonstrate that seed priming with amorphous silica (SiO2) nanoparticles (NPs) (20 mg/L) accelerated seed germination speed, increased seedlings vigor, and promoted seedling growth of rice under polyethylene glycol (PEG)-mimicking drought conditions. An orthogonal approach was used to uncover the mechanisms of accelerated seed germination and enhanced drought tolerance, including electron paramagnetic resonance, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), metabolomics, and transcriptomics. It was revealed that the unique surface chemistry of amorphous silica, characterized by an enrichment of silanol and siloxane groups, can catalyze the production of reactive oxygen species. This, in turn, initiates redox signaling and activates downstream drought-responsive genes. In addition, silica-primed seeds exhibited a significant enrichment of 18 amino acids and 6 sugars compared to those undergoing hydropriming, suggesting the accelerated mobilization of stored energy reserves. The drought-tolerance trait was observed in vegetative tissues of 35 day-old plants, where this tolerance was associated with an accelerated catabolism of amino acids and an enhanced anabolism of antioxidants. A separated field trial showed that SiO2NPs seed priming not only increased rice grain yield by 7.77% (p = 0.051) and 6.48% (p = 0.066), respectively, under normal and drought conditions but also increased the grain amino acid content.

Associations between artificial sweeteners (total, aspartame, acesulfame potassium [K], and sucralose) and T2D were investigated using Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for potential confounders, including weight variation during follow-up. RESULTS During a median follow-up of 9.1 years (946,650 person-years, 972 incident T2D), compared with nonconsumers, higher consumers of artificial sweeteners (i.e., above the sex-specific medians of 16.4 mg/day in men and 18.5 mg/day in women) had higher risks of developing T2D (hazard ratio [HR] 1.69; 95% CI 1.45\u20131.97; P-trend <0.001).

As a basis, an extensive literature search was conducted, identifying nearly 45,000 records related closely to various dimensions of sustainable agriculture. Out of these, based on a thorough selection process, 291 were included in further evaluations. The temporal distribution and content analyses indicated an improvement in the number of papers and the spectrum of addressed agricultural aspects.

On the other hand, sustainable agricultural practices consider sustainability\u2019s environmental, economic, and social aspects, thereby preserving environmental health and supporting economic viability and social well-being. The integrative assessment in this study suggests that adopting novel, innovative practices can achieve the most significant progress toward agricultural sustainability.

However, the metabolic fluxes and consequent costs and benefits of these strategies in a cereal crop have not been examined. We developed a metabolic model describing how the relative growth rate of Zea mays is impacted by hypothetical association with the rhizobium Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens and the AMF Rhizophagus irregularis. We found that the lower N content of cereal crops makes the relative growth rate cost associated with acquiring nitrogen from N2-fixing rhizobia smaller than in legumes. Our model also predicts positive synergies between rhizobia and AMF under nutrient-limited conditions but negative synergies under nutrient, particularly phosphorus, replete conditions. These findings indicate that these bioengineering strategies could improve cereal crop yields and may achieve greater gains in tandem, but soil nutrient status of target sites should be considered. Significance Statement Fertilizer application is responsible for substantial environmental impacts and represents a significant cost to farmers, both barriers to sustainable agricultural development. Engineering cereal crops to associate with N2-fixing rhizobia and enhancing existing associations between crops and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are two strategies that could address these challenges.

However, only a few evaluate the sustainability performance of roasting companies in consuming countries. This study examines the integration of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in business strategy to provide an overview of sustainability performance among Italian roasting companies. The analysis encompasses 78 sustainability practices across 49 businesses and assesses their communication to stakeholders. Furthermore, factors such as company size and specialty coffee sale were investigated for their influence on sustainability performance. The findings reveal a low commitment to sustainability within the Italian coffee sector, with 83.7% of companies in the first two stages of the five\u2010stage CSR assessment model.

In this study, the effects of ammonium supplementation on beef protein towards microbiome taxa and function in a high-fat diet were analyzed. Fecal microbiomes were characterized using a shotgun metagenomic approach for 16-month-old male and female mice after long-term diet treatments. The results for ammoniated diets showed that several bacteria known to be associated with health benefits increased significantly, including Romboutsia, Oscillospiraceae, and Lactococcus cremoris. The beneficial mucin-degrader Akkermansia was especially abundant, with a high prevalence (~86%) in females. Concurrently, the phyla Actinomycetota (Actinobacteria) and Bacteroidota (Bacteroidetes) were significantly reduced. While sex was a confounding factor affecting microbiome responses to ammonium supplementation in dietary protein, it is worth noting that several putatively beneficial microbiome functions increased with ammonium supplementation, such as glycine betaine transport, xenobiotic detoxification, enhanced defense, and others.

Tobacco growth indicators and soil property changes were observed and recorded through potting experiments. The activities of key enzymes (e.g., sucrase, catalase, urease) in soil were further determined. High-throughput sequencing technology was utilized to sequence the soil microbial community, and combined with macro-genomics analysis, the effects of T1 strain on soil microbial diversity and metabolic pathways were explored. Following the application of T1, significant improvements were observed in the height, leaf length, and width of tobacco plants. Furthermore, the physical and chemical properties of the soil were notably enhanced, including a 26.26% increase in phosphorus availability. Additionally, the activities of key soil enzymes such as sucrase, catalase, and urease were significantly increased, indicating improved soil health and fertility.

Previous studies have shown that gut microbiota of Eothenomys miletus can respond to environmental changes, high fiber or fat foods.

In the present study, we evaluated the altitude differences in gut microbiota and their interactions with physiology in terms of body mass regulation in order to study the adaptation of the gut microbiota and physiological indicators of the E. miletus under food restriction settings. E. miletus were collected for this study from Jingdong County (JD, low-altitude) and Xianggelila County (XGLL, high-altitude) in Yunnan Province, China, and split into three groups: control group, food-restricted feeding group for 7\u2009days, and re-feeding group was offered a standard diet for 14\u2009days. 16S rRNA gene sequencing and physiological methods were used to analyze the abundance and community structure of gut microbiota, as well as physiological indicators of each group in E. miletus. The results showed that while the RMR changed more during the period of food restriction, the body mass and major organ masses of E. miletus from high-altitude changed less. After food restriction, RMR in XGLL decreased by 25.25%, while that of in JD decreased by 16.54%. E. miletus from the XGLL had gut bacteria that were more abundant in Firmicutes and had fewer OTUs, and the microbiota had a closer interaction with physiological indicators. Moreover, the gut microbiota adapted to the food shortage environment by enhancing the genera of Bacterroides, Ruminococcus, Turicibacter, and Treponema to improve the utilization of nutrient resources. The interactions between microbial species and the equilibrium of energy homeostasis were further impacted by alterations in physiological indicators and microbial community structure.

The relationship between food insecurity and micronutrient deficiency requires more effort to deepen and discuss the relationship. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the association between food insecurity and micronutrient deficiency in adults. The research was conducted according to PRISMA using the Medline/Pubmed, Lilacs/BVS, Embase, Web of Science, and Cinahl databases. Studies carried out with male and female adults were included, which investigated the correlation or association between food insecurity and the nutritional status of micronutrients. There were no publication year, country, or language restrictions. A total of 1148 articles were found, and 18 of these were included, carried out mainly on the American continent and with women. The most evaluated micronutrients were iron and vitamin A. Food insecurity was associated with nutrient deficiency in 89% (n = 16) of the studies. As a result of the meta-analysis, it was observed that there is a greater chance of anemia and low levels of ferritin among food insecure individuals. It is concluded that food insecurity is associated with micronutrient deficiency. Understanding these problems allows the creation of public policies capable of contributing to changes.

Green technologies have made contributions to improving food production and reducing environmental pollution.

The paper started with the influence mechanism of green technology application on the green total factor productivity of grain (GTFPG). With the GTFPG, green technology efficiency change of grain (GECG) and green technical progress change of grain (GTCG) measured, threshold models were constructed to explore the nonlinear impacts of various green technologies on GTFPG and the influence paths. Results indicated that the differences of GTFPG among provinces in China were decreased mainly due to the changes of GTCG, while the regional differences of GECG remained small. The impacts of green technologies had threshold effects that depended on the ecological effects of green technologies in different application stages, and were significantly different in the major and non-major grain producing areas. Meanwhile, significant differences existed in the influence paths of green technologies. In the major grain producing areas, green technologies were more likely to improve GTFPG through the GTCG path; while in the non-major grain producing areas, the GECG path and the GTCG path were both important to improve GTFPG. The differences of green technologies\u2019 threshold effects and influence paths in the major and non-major grain producing areas were caused by regional technology preference, resource endowment and technology compatibility.

Detecting this threshold in empirical data remains a challenge because ecosystems are governed by complex interlinkages and feedback loops between their components and pressures. In addition, multiple feedback mechanisms exist that can make an ecosystem resilient to state shifts. Therefore, unless a broad ecological perspective is used to detect state shifts, it remains questionable to what extent current detection methods really capture ecosystem state shifts and whether inferences made from smaller scale analyses can be implemented into ecosystem management. We reviewed the techniques currently used for retrospective detection of state shifts detection from empirical data. We show that most techniques are not suitable for taking a broad ecosystem perspective because approximately 85% do not combine intervariable non-linear relationships and high-dimensional data from multiple ecosystem variables, but rather tend to focus on one subsystem of the ecosystem. Thus, our perception of state shifts may be limited by methods that are often used on smaller data sets, unrepresentative of whole ecosystems.

This variability complicates the processing of locally baled straw with a single device. To address this issue, an adjustable feeding and bale-breaking device was developed and tested to enhance the filamentous performance of baled straw. The machine integrates a series of bale-breaking knives along with a pair of feeding and bale-breaking rollers. This paper presents an overview of the machine\u2019s structure and operating principles, alongside an analysis of the forces acting on the straw within the device, which informed the design of key components and devices. A discrete element simulation model suitable for square baled-straw has been established, providing a research foundation for the subsequent optimization of device design parameters. Effects of motor bale-breaking roller rotating speed (x1), bale-breaking roller height (x2) and bale-breaking knife quantity (x3) on the productivity of bonding bond destruction rate (Y1) and the particle average speed (Y2) were explored. Three-dimensional quadratic regression orthogonal rotation central combination experiment method combined with response surface method was used to conduct experiments and explore the interaction effects of influence factors on indicators. A regression model of influence factors and evaluation indicators was established through the analysis of variance. The significant factors affecting Y1 were ordered of x1, x2, x3, and the significant factors affecting Y2 were ordered of x2, x3, x1. In the interaction of factors, x1x2 and x2x3 had an extremely significant impact, and x1x3 had a significant impact on Y1; x1x2, x1x3 and x2x3 had a significant impact on Y2. The optimal structure and working parameters combination were determined to be 1448 rpm for x1, 268 mm for x2, and 14 pieces for x3. Verification experiments demonstrated that the actual values were 96.95% for the straw rubbing rate and 235.13 kg/(kW\u00b7h) for the per unit power productivity. The operation of the adjustable feeding and bale-breaking device developed in this study proved effective in enhancing productivity and breaking performance during the feeding of baled straw.

The potential benefits of harnessing the power of the phytomicrobiome for plant disease suppression and management are indisputable and of interest in agriculture but also in forestry and landscaping. Indeed, plant diseases can be mitigated by in situ manipulations of resident microorganisms through agronomic practices (such as minimum tillage, crop rotation, cover cropping, organic mulching, etc.) as well as by applying microbial inoculants. However, numerous challenges, such as the lack of standardized methods for microbiome analysis and the difficulty in translating research findings into practical applications are at stake.

In this comprehensive review paper, we explore the multifaceted relationships at the fungi-plant interface, encompassing both mutualistic and antagonistic interactions, and the environmental factors influencing these associations. Mutualistic associations, notably mycorrhizal relationships, play a pivotal role in enhancing plant health and ecological balance. On the contrary, fungal diseases pose a significant threat to plant health, agriculture, and natural ecosystems, such as rusts, smuts, powdery mildews, downy mildews, and wilts, which can cause extensive damage and lead to substantial economic losses. Environmental constraints encompassing abiotic and biotic factors are elucidated to understand their role in shaping the fungi-plant interface. Temperature, moisture, and soil conditions, along with the presence of other microbes, herbivores, and competing plants, significantly influence the outcome of these interactions. The interplay between mutualism and antagonism is emphasised as a key determinant of ecosystem health and stability. The implications of these interactions extend to overall ecosystem productivity, agriculture, and conservation efforts. The potential applications of this knowledge in bioremediation, biotechnology, and biocontrol strategies emphasise the importance of adapting to climate change.

Mogroside V (MGV) and mogrol (MG) are its main active ingredients, which have been found to be effective in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases recently. However, whether they can effectively treat Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) and their underlying mechanisms have not been sufficiently explored. In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective and metabolic regulatory effects of MGV and MG on PD. Materials and methods Using SH-SY5Y cell models and an MPTP-induced mouse model of PD, we evaluated the compounds\u2019 efficacy in mitigating MPP+-induced neurotoxicity and ameliorating motor deficits and dopaminergic neuron loss. Employing widely targeted metabolomics and bioinformatics analysis to investigate the Metabolic imbalance rectification caused by MGV and MG treatment. The vivo experimental protocol encompassed a 14-day drug administration regimen with mice randomly allocated into six groups (n = 9) receiving distinct compound dosages including a control group, a model group, MGV-H (30 mg/kg/day), MGV-L (10 mg/kg/day), MG-H (15 mg/kg/day), and MG-L (3 mg/kg/day). Results Our findings revealed that pre-treatment with MGV and MG significantly enhanced cell viability in SH-SY5Y cells exposed to MPP+, demonstrating a potent protective effect against neurotoxicity. In the MPTP mouse model, MGV-H, MGV-L, and MG-H significantly enhanced motor coordination as assessed by the rotarod test (p < 0.05); MGV-L and MG-H evidently inhibited dopaminergic neuronal loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta (p < 0.05). Furthermore, metabolomic analysis of the substantia nigra highlighted the restoration of metabolic balance, with MGV-L and MG-H impacting 160 differential metabolites and modulating key pathways disrupted in PD, including sphingolipid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, and amino acid metabolism. Notably, treatment with MGV-L and MG-H led to the regulation of 106 metabolites, showing a recovery trend towards normal levels, which constitutes approximately 17.5% of the identified metabolites. Key metabolites such as n-acetyl-l-glutamate, hexadecanoic acid, and 9-octadecenal were significantly altered (p < 0.05), underscoring their broad-spectrum metabolic regulatory capacity.

Toaddress this issue, we investigated the synergistic interaction between Spirulina, a nutrient-rich microalga, and two strains of folic acid-producing bacteria, Bacillus subtilis-1 and Bacillus subtilis-2, to enhance folate production. Spirulinahas high nutritional content, combined with the folate production capabilities of the selected bacteria, offered a promising opportunity for sustainable folate synthesis. In this study, Spirulinaand the two strains of Bacillus subtilis were cultured separately to optimize growth conditions for each organism. Co-culture experiments were then conducted, combining Spirulina with Bacillus subtilis-1 and also Bacillus subtilis-2, to investigate their collective potential for folate production. The specific growth rates of both Spirulinaand the bacteria were measured individually and in combination using spectrophotometric methods, and their dry weights were determined to assess biomass productivity. Folate quantification in the microalgal-bacterial cultures was performed using a spectrophotometric analysis based on the phosphate buffer extraction method. This method facilitated the measurement of folate content investigated the impact of the symbiotic relationship between Spirulina and bacteria, particularly in terms of enhancing vitamin B12 acquisition and its impact on folate synthesis.

Photo-thermo-sensitive male-sterile (PTMS) wheat lines, which play a critical role as female parents in hybrid seed production, face challenges under HT conditions. However, the mechanisms governing grain filling in PTMS lines under HT stress remain poorly understood. This study used the BS253 line to investigate the effects of HT on grain filling, primarily focusing on the transition from sucrose unloading to starch synthesis. The findings indicated that HT significantly reduced the grain starch content and weight by 7.65% and 36.35% at maturity, respectively. Further analysis revealed that the expression levels of TaSUT1 and TaSWEETs in grains initially increased after HT stress, paralleling the rise in sucrose content during the same period. The activities of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, granule-bound starch synthase, and soluble starch synthase were markedly decreased, indicating that impaired starch synthesis was a key factor limiting grain filling immediately after HT exposure. A total of 41 key regulatory genes involved in sucrose-to-starch metabolism were identified, with HT significantly reducing the expression of genes associated with pathways from sucrose unloading to starch synthesis during the middle and late stages post-HT. Based on the observed ultrastructural changes in the abdominal phloem and sucrose transporter expression levels under HT, we concluded that limited sucrose supply, degradation, and inhibition of starch synthesis collectively constrained grain filling during these stages. Additionally, 11 heat shock proteins and two catalase genes were identified and significantly upregulated during the initial phase post-HT, suggesting their potential role in enhancing sucrose supply at this critical time. More importantly, seven key genes involved in the sucrose-to-starch pathway were identified by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), which provides target genes for their functional research for starch synthase. These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of how HT limits grain filling, identify several genes involved in the sucrose-to-starch pathway, and offer a novel perspective for future research on HT-restricted grain filling across the entire process from sucrose unloading to starch synthesis in developing grains.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-11-01", "synthetic_support_claim": "HT significantly reduced the grain starch content and weight by 7.65% and 36.35%, respectively.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "PTMS wheat lines can increase grain yield under high-temperature stress conditions through genetic modification."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "736118cd3a1d4b11f626b4325c2b9378aeb6508a", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/736118cd3a1d4b11f626b4325c2b9378aeb6508a", "title": "Improvements in Tolerance to Heat Stress in Rice via Molecular Mechanisms and Rice Varieties", "abstract": "Global warming affects crop growth and development, threatening food security.

The changes in the amino-acid content, the quality of proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids, and the technological characteristics of the raw materials when infested by specific insects are presented. The differences reported concerning the rate and kind of infestation effects are related to the trophic habits of the infesting insect species, the variation of the component distribution in the different species of grains, and the length of the storage period. For example, wheat germ and brans feeders such as Trogoderma granarium may cause a higher reduction in proteins than endosperm feeders such as Rhyzopertha dominica, since the germ and brans contain higher concentrations of proteins. Trogoderma granarium may also cause higher reduction in lipids than R. dominica in wheat, maize and sorghum, in which most of the lipids exist in the germ. Furthermore, infestation with insects such as Tribolium castaneum may downgrade the overall quality of wheat flour, by increasing the moisture content, the number of insect fragments, the color change, the concentration of uric acid, the microbial growth, and the prevalence of aflatoxins.

In addition to directly causing weight loss through feeding damage, insects also drastically reduce nutrients, lower the proportion of seeds that germinate, lower the grade, and decrease the market value of the crop as a result of waste accumulation, webbing, and insect dead bodies. The use of antiquated and conventional chemical fumigants to control stored grain insect pests has been a prevalent practice for a long time, which results in environmental contamination, residual toxicity, and resurgence. Due to high pathogenicity and minimal human toxicity, entomopathogenic fungi may be a viable option over traditional techniques for managing stored grain insect pests and can be treated as a novel solution for protecting the stored grains. Under consideration of these facts, the goal of the current study was to examine how three distinct entomopathogenic fungi ( Beauveria bassiana , Metarhizium anisopliae , and Lecanicillium lecanii ) affected wheat grain insects ( Sitophilus oryzae , Rizopertha dominica, and Tribolium castaneum ) that were kept in storage.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-10-30", "synthetic_support_claim": "Entomopathogenic fungi can effectively manage stored grain insect pests, offering a novel protection method.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Entomopathogenic fungi completely eliminate the need for chemical fumigants in managing stored grain pests."}, "future_paper": {"paperId": "bf944f2939fb60d3df830e29debe6a1a1d11af1a", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bf944f2939fb60d3df830e29debe6a1a1d11af1a", "title": "Chemical Composition of Essential Oils and Their Potential Applications in Postharvest Storage of Cereal Grains", "abstract": "Insect infestation and microbial, particularly mold contamination, are the major causes of stored grain deterioration during postharvest storage, which results in a significant loss in grain quality and quantity, and the formation of toxic chemicals such as mycotoxins.

In Romania, where traditional diets are heavily dependent on animal-based products, optimizing land use is critical. This study investigates the potential of plant-based diets to reduce agricultural land use, examining scenarios of partial and complete replacement of animal protein with plant protein sources (soy, peas, and potatoes). Methods: The research modeled three dietary transition scenarios\u2014replacing 33%, 50%, and 100% of animal protein with plant-based protein\u2014using data from the Romanian National Institute of Statistics, the FAO, and international sources. Land use was calculated for each scenario using formulas that take into account protein content and land use intensity for animal and plant protein sources. The simulations quantify the reduction in agricultural land use at the per capita and national levels. Results: The study reveals significant land-saving potential across all scenarios. At the national level, land use reductions ranged from 84,020 hectares (33% replacement) to 1,067,443 hectares (100% replacement). High-impact products such as beef and dairy continue to dominate land use, even in partial replacement scenarios. Conversely, replacing pork and chicken proteins shows substantial savings. The findings highlight the inefficiency of animal-based protein production and the ecological benefits of transitioning to plant-based diets. Conclusions: A dietary shift towards plant-based protein in Romania could achieve significant reductions in agricultural land use, contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals.

A total of 30 Braford steers were utilized in the study. Of these, 15 animals were supplemented with corn silage for 120 days, while the remaining animals were fed exclusively on pasture. LTL steak samples were aged for 2, 7, 14, and 21 days at a temperature of 2 \u00b1 1\u00b0C, under conditions of darkness and vacuum. Several colorimetric assays were employed to evaluate the antioxidant capacity of both enzymatic and non-enzymatic origin, as well as the levels of protein and lipid oxidation. The content of heme pigment was determined by a spectrophotometric assay, while the fluorescence fingerprint of beef was evaluated by fluorescence spectroscopy excitation-emission matrices (FEEM). Additionally, the muscle microstructure was analyzed via scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results demonstrated that the finishing system did not exert any discernible influence on the rates of lipid oxidation, antioxidant capacity, or muscle microstructure. However, the carbonyl content and total myoglobin exhibited higher levels in the corn silage-supplemented animals. Conversely, during aging period, data revealed that lipid degradation proceeded at a faster rate than protein oxidation, accompanied by a notable enhancement in antioxidant capacity within the hydrophilic meat extracts. In contrast, the lipophilic extracts demonstrated a reduction in both enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant capabilities with the progression of post mortem aging. The aforementioned alterations were accompanied by a reduction in the muscle microstructure during the aging process. The results demonstrate that finishing steers with or without corn silage over 120 days results in comparable and satisfactory beef quality after 21 days of vacuum aging.

Functioning in intercellular sugar transport, SWEETs influence a wide range of physiologically important processes. SWEETs regulate the development of sink organs by providing nutritional support from source leaves, responses to abiotic stresses by maintaining intracellular sugar concentrations, and host\u2013pathogen interactions through the modulation of apoplastic sugar levels. Many bacterial and fungal pathogens activate the expression of SWEET genes in species such as rice and Arabidopsis to gain access to the nutrients that support virulence. The genetic manipulation of SWEETs has led to the generation of bacterial blight (BB)\u2010resistant rice varieties. Similarly, while the overexpression of the SWEETs involved in sucrose export from leaves and pathogenesis led to growth retardation and yield penalties, plants overexpressing SWEETs show improved disease resistance. Such findings demonstrate the complex functions of SWEETs in growth and stress tolerance. Here, we review the importance of SWEETs in plant\u2013pathogen and source\u2013sink interactions and abiotic stress resistance.

The mechanism of cotton resistance to Verticillium wilt is very complex and requires further research. In this study, RNA-sequencing was used to investigate the defense responses of cotton leaves using varieties resistant (Zhongzhimian 2, or Z2) or susceptible (Xinluzao 7, or X7) to V. dahliae. The leaf samples were collected at 48 and 72 hpi (hours post infection) from the two varieties infected by V. dahliae (strain Vd991) or treated by water. Compared to X7, Z2 had less genes responsive to V. dahliae infection at 72 hpi and had no DEGs (differentially expressed genes) at 48 hpi. WGCNA (Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis) revealed seven key gene modules which were responsible for the resistance of Z2 and susceptibility of X7. KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) analysis of these modules found that several reported disease resistance pathways were found to be up-regulated in Z2, with some of those pathways down-regulated in X7. Unexpectedly, several photosynthesis-related pathways were significantly up-regulated in the leaves of X7 infected by V. dahliae, leading to different profiles of glucose content, which was significantly decreased at 72 hpi and 48 hpi in X7 and Z2, respectively. These results suggest that the leaves of resistant varieties have a slower and different response to V. dahliae compared to those of the susceptible variety, as well as that the translocation of sugars produced by photosynthesis in cotton leaves might vary between the two varieties. Additionally, several HUB genes regulating disease response were identified, including NDR1/HIN1-like protein 12, DELLA protein, cytochrome P450 family protein and LRR receptor-like serine/threonine-protein kinase genes, which have been reported to be related to disease resistance in other plants, which might serve as potential candidates for breeding cotton disease resistance.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2024-12-01", "synthetic_support_claim": "Resistant cotton varieties exhibit slower and different responses to Verticillium dahliae compared to susceptible varieties.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Vertical farming techniques enhance resistance of cotton varieties to Verticillium wilt when compared to traditional methods."}}, {"prior_paper": {"paperId": "39a1ee6e2ff70520f8eebd38ef4a6f41a4d561f1", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/39a1ee6e2ff70520f8eebd38ef4a6f41a4d561f1", "title": "Dynamic alterations in protein, sensory, chemical, and oxidative properties occurring in meat during thermal and non-thermal processing techniques: A comprehensive review", "abstract": "Meat processing represents an inevitable part of meat and meat products preparation for human consumption.

Despite their rich content in bioactive components such as \u03b2-glucans, industrial utilization faces challenges, particularly due to variability in their composition. This inconsistency impacts the reliability and standardization of final products, limiting broader adoption in industrial applications. \u03b2-Glucans are dietary fibers or polysaccharides renowned for their diverse bioactive properties, including immunomodulatory, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antitumor, and cholesterol- and glucose-lowering effects. They modulate the immune system by activating Dectin-1 and TLR receptors on immune cells, enhancing phagocytosis, cytokine production, and adaptive immune responses. Their antioxidant activity arises from neutralizing free radicals and reducing oxidative stress, thereby protecting cells and tissues. \u03b2-Glucans also exhibit antitumor effects by inhibiting cancer cell growth, inducing apoptosis, and preventing angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels essential for tumor development. Additionally, they lower cholesterol and glucose levels by forming a viscous gel in the intestine, which reduces lipid and carbohydrate absorption, improving metabolic health. The biological activity of \u03b2-glucans varies with their molecular weight and source, further highlighting their versatility and functional potential. This study investigates how grape variety, vinification technology and extraction methods affect the yield and properties of \u03b2-glucans extracted from wine lees. The physico-chemical and mineral composition of different wine lees were analyzed, and two extraction methods of \u03b2-glucans from wine lees were tested: acid-base extraction and autolysis. These two methods were also tested under ultrasound-assisted conditions at different frequencies, as well as without the use of ultrasound. The \u03b2-glucan yield and properties were evaluated under different conditions. FTIR spectroscopy was used to assess the functional groups and structural characteristics of the \u03b2-glucans extracted from the wine lees, helping to confirm their composition and quality. Rheological behavior of the extracted \u03b2-glucans was also assessed to understand the impact of extraction method and raw material origin. The findings highlight that vinification technology significantly affects the composition of wine lees, while both the extraction method and yeast origin influence the yield and type of \u03b2-glucans obtained. The autolysis method provided higher \u03b2-glucan yields (18.95 \u00b1 0.49% to 39.36 \u00b1 0.19%) compared to the acid\u2013base method (3.47 \u00b1 0.66% to 19.76 \u00b1 0.58%). FTIR spectroscopy revealed that the \u03b2-glucan extracts contain a variety of glucan and polysaccharide types, with distinct \u03b2-glucans (\u03b2-1,4, \u03b2-1,3, and \u03b2-1,6) identified through specific absorption peaks. The rheological behavior of suspensions exhibited pseudoplastic or shear-thinning behavior, where viscosity decreased significantly as shear rate increased. This behavior, observed across all \u03b2-glucan extracts, is typical of polymer-containing suspensions. These insights are critical for optimizing \u03b2-glucan extraction processes, supporting sustainability efforts and waste valorization in the wine industry.

The purpose of this study was to examine and compare the effects of iron oxide nanoparticles (FeONPs) and zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) on the microbial activity and biochemical properties of differently textured soils. A mesocosm experiment was conducted using three soil types\u2013clay loam (CL), sandy clay loam (SCL), and sandy loam (SL) amended with farmyard manure (FYM), ZnONPs and/or FeONPs. The results revealed significant differences in microbial colony-forming units (CFUs) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the order of SL > SCL > CL. Compared with those from the unfertilized control, the CO2 emissions from the FYM increased by 112%, 184% and 221% for CL, SCL and SL, respectively. The addition of ZnONPs and FeONPs notably increased the microbial biomass Zn/Fe, which reflected their consumption by the soil microbes. As a result, microbial CFUs were considerably reduced, which led to a 24%, 8% and 12% reduction in cumulative CO2 emissions after the addition of ZnONPs to the CL, SCL and SL soils, respectively. The respective decrements in the case of FeONPs were 19%, 2% and 12%. The temporal dynamics of CO2 emissions revealed that the CO2 emissions from CL with or without FYM/NPs did not differ much during the first few days and later became pronounced with time. Almost all the studied chemical characteristics of the soils were not strongly affected by the ZnONPs/FeONPs, except EC, which decreased with the addition of these nanomaterials to the manure-amended soils. Principal component analysis revealed that the ZnONPs and FeONPs are negatively corelated with microbial CFUs, and CO2 emission, with ZnONPs being more toxic to soil microbes than FeONPs, though their toxicity is strongly influenced by soil texture.

Because of its persistent nature in soil, it can suppress subsequent crops, including wheat. There is limited information focusing on methods of protecting wheat from fomesafen injury by soil residue.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBioassay results showed slight variations in tolerance to fomesafen among 31 wheat cultivars. Soil-applied biochar (200\u2009g\u2009m-2) could alleviate fomesafen injury at 2\u2009mg\u2009L-1, and partially alleviate fomesafen injury at 4\u2009mg\u2009L-1. Seed soaking in safeners cloquintocet-mexyl and mefenpyr-diethyl was more effective in protecting seedlings from fomesafen injury at 4\u2009mg\u2009L-1 compared with 1,8-naphthalic anhydride, fenclorim or dichlormid. Indoor tests suggested that the combined application of biochar and cloquintocet-mexyl or mefenpyr-diethyl had a synergistic alleviating effect on wheat injury caused by fomesafen, which was further confirmed in a field trial. Wheat seeds treated with cloquintocet-mexyl increased expression of the fomesafen target protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase and light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b binding protein, leading to an increase in chlorophyll content and a decrease in oxidative stress of wheat exposed to fomesafen. Cloquintocet-mexyl treatment had no influence on the expression of P450 genes, toxic transport genes, most glutathione S-transferase (GST) genes, the enzyme activity of P450 or GSTs, and the metabolism rate of fomesafen.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThese results suggested that cloquintocet-mexyl acted by increasing photosynthesis and decreasing oxidative stress to alleviate injury to wheat exposed to fomesafen stress, showing no influence on fomesafen metabolism in wheat.

Although the types of bacteria found in raw milk are very diverse, select groups are particularly important from the perspective of finished product quality. In particular, psychrophilic and psychrotolerant bacteria that grow quickly at low temperatures (e.g., species in the genus Pseudomonas and the family Enterobacteriaceae) and produce heat-stable enzymes, and sporeforming bacteria that survive processing hurdles in spore form, are the 2 primary groups of bacteria related to effects on processed dairy products. Understanding factors leading to the presence of these important bacterial groups in raw milk is key to reducing their influence on processed dairy product quality. Here we examine the raw milk microbiological parameters used in the contemporary dairy industry for their utility in identifying raw milk supplies that will perform well in processed dairy products. We further recommend the use of a single microbiological indicator of raw milk quality, namely the total bacteria count, and call for the development of a whole-farm approach to raw milk quality that will use data-driven, risk-based tools integrated across the continuum from production to processing and shelf-life to ensure continuous improvement in dairy product quality.", "publicationTypes": ["Review", "JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2023-01-01", "synthetic_support_claim": "We recommend using total bacteria count as a single microbiological indicator of raw milk quality.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Raw milk has significant probiotic health benefits that improve gut flora and overall human health."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "1848e9d341b3e71c7fac2c186c2e9a61fa9f7989", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1848e9d341b3e71c7fac2c186c2e9a61fa9f7989", "title": "Recent Development in Detection and Control of Psychrotrophic Bacteria in Dairy Production: Ensuring Milk Quality", "abstract": "Milk is an ideal environment for the growth of microorganisms, especially psychrotrophic bacteria, which can survive under cold conditions and produce heat-resistant enzymes.

Different types of alpine grassland ecosystems, at least for forage nutrient storages, may have different responses to grazing. Warm-season grazing significantly reduced crude protein (CP) storage, acid detergent fiber (ADF) storage, and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) storage of high-quality forage by 53.29, 63.82, and 63.26%, respectively, but cold-season grazing did not significantly alter the CP, ADF and NDF storages of high-quality forage.

Due to the carrying capacity being low during the yellow and wintering periods, we combined them and calculated the carrying capacity for only three periods, including the flourishing period, greening period, and withering period. The grassland pressure index (GPI) was measured by the ratio of the actual standard sheep number and the calculated number. The results showed that the herbage yield and nutrient output were higher in spring and summer, lower in autumn and winter, and showed a tendency for alpine meadows to be higher than alpine grasslands during the flourishing period (p\u2009<\u20090.05). The unit area carrying capacity varied significantly with the season and showed the seasonal changing characteristics of the flourishing period\u2009>\u2009greening period\u2009>\u2009withering period. The seasonal carrying number was much higher than the actual carrying number during the flourishing period and much lower than the actual carrying number during the withering period. In terms of annual carrying capacity, the GPI was balanced when considering livestock alone, while critical overloaded when considering livestock and wildlife.

To investigate the effects of the combined foliar application of zinc (Zn) and iron (Fe) nanoparticles with the recommended nitrogen dose (RND) on maize production and grain chemical composition under different water regimes, two field experiments were conducted in El-Ayyat city, Giza, Egypt, during the summer seasons of 2022 and 2023. This study utilized a split-split-plot experimental design with three replications. The main plots were designated to different water regimes (100, 80, 60, and 40% of estimated evapotranspiration), while the sub-plots were randomly distributed with Zn and Fe nanoparticle concentrations (0, 100, and 200 mg/L). The sub-sub-plots were randomly allocated to three maize cultivars (SC-P3062, SC-32D99, and SC-P3433). The results revealed that exposure to drought conditions resulted in a significant decline in the yield and yield-related attributes across all maize cultivars examined. Grain yield decreased by 10\u201350% under drought conditions. However, the foliar application of Zn and Fe nanoparticles was found to significantly improve grain yield, protein content, oil content, starch content, crude fiber, ash, and macro- and micronutrient concentrations in the maize cultivars under control and drought stress conditions. The foliar application of Zn and Fe nanoparticles at a concentration of 200 mg/L to the SC-P3433 maize cultivar led to the greatest grain yield per hectare, reaching 11,749 and 11,657 kg under the irrigation regimes with 100 and 80% total evapotranspiration, respectively. According to the assessment using the relative drought index, the SC-P3062 maize cultivar demonstrated tolerance (T) to water stress conditions. In conclusion, the foliar application of Zn and Fe nanoparticles (100\u2013200 mg/L) effectively mitigated the negative effects of drought stress on maize plants.

All treatments included a common basic level and different spring production levels of nitrogen fertilisation (0 kg N in the case of GD; 30 kg N in the case of BT; and 60 kg N in the case of IT). Pesticide applications included herbicides and insecticides in both the BT and IT treatments, which were supplemented by combinations of fungicide and morphoregulator in the IT treatment. The GD treatment included only basic nitrogen, herbicide protection, and the application of a biostimulator (ExelGrow). The spring durum wheat cultivars subjected to testing were cultivated under Central European conditions, specifically in the Czech Republic\u2019s central Bohemian region. UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS was used for the detection and accurate quantification of PAAs. In parallel, 12 other nutritional and basic technological parameters of the cereal were evaluated. Nine bound and seven free forms of PAAs were quantified in the analysed cereal samples. Bound forms of PAAs were dominant, accounting for 99.4% of total PAAs. Considering single PAAs, ferulic acid was the most abundant, accounting for 87% of the total bound PAAs. Interestingly, year and treatment intensity were the key factors in the variability of both free and bound PAAs, but these factors had different effects on bound PAAs. Under low nitrogen conditions, plants responded with an increase in free PAAs in particular, as well as in three bound PAAs. Unfavourable weather conditions, combined with the presence of biotic factors (e.g., Fusarium infections), significantly influenced the increase in both PAA groups, with the exception of free p-coumaric acid. PCA analysis confirmed close relationships between PAAs within both categories (free and bound). Subsequent correlation analysis further revealed that the immunoreactive gluten component (G12) exhibited a high negative correlation with the dominant ferulic acid (r = \u22120.70) and sinapic acid (r = \u22120.68).

Climate change will result in rising temperatures, changes in rainfall patterns and an increased occurrence of extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, cold spells, frost days, droughts and floods. The effects of climate change have recently become more evident, with rising temperatures, altered and irregular precipitation patterns and increased extreme weather events. These changes are directly impacting the maturity and development of fruit crops. Heat stress during flowering and fruit set can greatly reduce fruit production, while irregular rainfall may disrupt pollination and heighten the risk of pests and diseases. Furthermore, increased carbon dioxide levels can influence the quality characteristics of fruits. To maintain the ongoing production and sustainability of fruit crops, it is vital to enhance resilience. Focusing on developing new varieties that offer higher yield potential and resistance to various stresses, such as drought, flooding and salinity, is crucial for sustaining crop yields. Additionally, breeding programs should aim to enhance the germplasm of key tropical and subtropical fruit crops to improve heat stress tolerance.\u00a0Recent advancements in genetic editing technologies present substantial opportunities for the agricultural sector, especially in enhancing fruit crop traits.

The results indicated that the grain sorghum production area in Kansas has increased in the most recent decade (2010\u20132022) at an average rate of 8 thousand ha year\u22121. With the current 1.2 million ha harvest area, Kansas continues to allocate more land area for sorghum than any other state in the USA. The average current annual economic value of sorghum in Kansas is USD 0.5 billion. The average sorghum grain productivity for recent years (2000\u20132022) was 4.3 Mg ha\u22121 in Kansas. The year-to-year yield variation in the grain sorghum average for Kansas in the years 1929\u20131956 was \u00b10.5 Mg ha\u22121 but increased to \u00b12 Mg ha\u22121 for the years 1957\u20132022.

The present review deals with the in-depth understanding of steps involved in host colonization by biocontrol bacteria. The colonization process starts from the root zone, where biocontrol bacteria establish initial interactions with the plant's root system. Moving beyond the roots, biocontrol bacteria migrate and colonize other plant organs, including stems, leaves, and even flowers. Also, the present review attempts to explore the mechanisms facilitating bacterial movement within the plant such as migrating through interconnected spaces such as vessels or in the apoplast, and applying quorum sensing or extracellular enzymes during colonization and what is needed to establish a long-term association within a plant. The impacts on microbial community dynamics, nutrient cycling, and overall plant health are discussed, emphasizing the intricate relationships between biocontrol bacteria and the plant's microbiome and the benefits to the plant's above-ground parts, the biocontrol 40 bacteria confer.

Due to the date fruit\u2019s significant nutritional and functional characteristics, it can be an exceptional choice for developing snack bars. Dates contain a wide range of macro- and micronutrients known for their strong bioactive properties. The functional properties of date fruit have been demonstrated in the literature and include antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, antihypertensive, and antimicrobial activities. This review summarizes the available studies investigating the potential application of dates for developing nutritive and functional snack bars. Date paste was used as a main ingredient at 55\u201390% concentrations. In addition, protein sources were used to provide protein-rich snack bars, as date fruit is considered high in carbohydrates and low in protein. Skim milk powder was the most common and favorable protein source, delivering significant amounts of protein with limited negative effects on sensory attributes. Incorporating other ingredients, such as cereals or legumes, was also explored; adding such dry ingredients can promote positive nutritional effects along with improving sensory attributes, mainly in terms of the bars\u2019 textures. Dry ingredients can significantly lower moisture content, reducing the bars\u2019 fracturability to acceptable ranges. Reduced moisture content can also significantly enhance the shelf-life stability, as observed by limited microbial growth. Furthermore, the incorporation of bioactive or functional ingredients such as fruit peels, plant seeds, or plant leaf extracts was also reported; such ingredients promoted significant enhancements in the contents of phenolics or flavonoids, for instance, leading to an increase in the bars\u2019 antioxidant potential. Though dates are rich in such bioactive components, incorporating additional bioactive ingredients can boost the dates\u2019 functional properties. In conclusion, this review shows the high potential of the application of dates for developing nutritious and functional snack bars.

Pomegranate peel is considered to be beneficial due to its functional and therapeutic properties as it is a source of many biological active components like polyphenols, tannins and flavonoids. Nutrient rich and ready-made foods are the demand of everyone due to their easy availability and cost effectiveness. Among the confectionary products, bars are liked by individuals of different age groups. Hence, nutritional properties of bars can be enhanced by using pomegranate peel powder. The current study was designed to develop bars enriched with pomegranate peel powder as a basic ingredient. Pomegranate peel powder is prepared and analyzed for proximate, mineral, total phenolic content, total flavonoid content and anti-oxidant potential (DPPH). By using pomegranate peel powder, oats and jaggery, bars were prepared. In this research, five treatments T0 (0% pomegranate peel powder and 100% oats).

Also, the antibacterial action of the extract was elucidated. Different concentrations of the extract were incubated with HepG2 to determine cytotoxicity, followed by cell cycle analysis. The in vivo experiment was accomplished by grouping the animals into four different groups (n = 10); normal control, SEC, C. media 100, and C. media 200. The extract was administered at 100 and 200 mg/kg. Tumor volume, tumor inhibition rate, toxicity profile, and antioxidant biomarkers were determined. Moreover, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway was investigated as a possible underlying antitumor mechanism. The tumor control group showed a remarkable upregulation for PI3K, p-AKT, and p-mTOR, along with downregulation for the antioxidant SOD and GPX4, as well as decreased levels of GSH and MDA. C. media extract reversed these parameters to a significant level and the higher dose showed a superior antitumor effect. C. media extract showed antiproliferative effects against HepG2 cells, along with a suppressive action on the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and an antioxidant effect.

Especially in grape production, the visible and near infrared (VNIR) and the short-wave infrared (SWIR) regions are of great interest, and they may be utilized for both fruit monitoring and quality control at all stages of maturity. The aim of this work was the quantitative estimation of the wine grape ripeness, for four different grape varieties, by using a highly accurate contact probe spectrometer that covers the entire VNIR\u2013SWIR spectrum (350\u20132500 nm). The four varieties under examination were Chardonnay, Malagouzia, Sauvignon-Blanc, and Syrah and all the samples were collected over the 2020 and 2021 harvest and pre-harvest phenological stages (corresponding to stages 81 through 89 of the BBCH scale) from the vineyard of Ktima Gerovassiliou located in Northern Greece. All measurements were performed in situ and a refractometer was used to measure the total soluble solids content (\u00b0Brix) of the grapes, providing the ground truth data. After the development of the grape spectra library, four different machine learning algorithms, namely Partial Least Squares regression (PLS), Random Forest regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), coupled with several pre-treatment methods were applied for the prediction of the \u00b0Brix content from the VNIR\u2013SWIR hyperspectral data. The performance of the different models was evaluated using a cross-validation strategy with three metrics, namely the coefficient of the determination (R2), the root mean square error (RMSE), and the ratio of performance to interquartile distance (RPIQ). High accuracy was achieved for Malagouzia, Sauvignon-Blanc, and Syrah from the best models developed using the CNN learning algorithm (R2>0.8, RPIQ\u22654), while a good fit was attained for the Chardonnay variety from SVR (R2=0.63, RMSE=2.10, RPIQ=2.24), proving that by using a portable spectrometer the in situ estimation of the wine grape maturity could be provided.

The 2020 UNICEF Conceptual Framework on the Determinants of Maternal and Child Nutrition served as the foundation for this investigation. Utilizing a case study design within an interpretive research paradigm, this study sought to assess how reinforcing maternal nutritional knowledge, guided by Food-Based Dietary Guidelines (FBDGs), could help reduce the prevalence of these NCDs during early childhood. A group of 10 individuals was selected using purposive sampling, and a qualitative approach was employed to gather insights. The study revealed that many survey participants were unaware of the South African Food-Based Dietary Guidelines (SA FBDGs). Some mentioned their search for official guidelines from SA FBDGs, while others referred to the four dietary categories.

Significant knowledge on the fate of food during digestion has been generated in healthy adults due to the development of physiologically-relevant in vitro digestion models. However, it appears that the performance of the oro-gastrointestinal tract is affected by ageing and that a model simulating the digestive conditions found in a younger adult (<65 years) is not relevant for an older adult (>65 years). The objectives of the present paper were: (1) to conduct an exhaustive literature search to find data on the physiological parameters of the older adult oro-gastrointestinal tract, (2) to define the parameters of an in vitro digestion model adapted to the older adult. International experts have discussed all the parameters during a dedicated workshop organized within the INFOGEST network. Data on food bolus properties collected in the older adult were gathered, including food particle size found in older adult boluses. In the stomach and small intestine, data suggest that significant physiological changes are observed between younger and older adults. In the latter, the rate of gastric emptying is slowed down, the pH of the stomach content is higher, the amount of secretions and thus the hydrolytic activities of gastric and intestinal digestive enzymes are reduced and the concentration of bile salts lower. The consensus in vitro digestion model of the older adult proposed here will allow significant progress to be made in understanding the fate of food in this specific population, facilitating the development of foods adapted to their nutritional needs.

Recent developments in analytical techniques (e.g., protein crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, fluorescence anisotropy, and molecular docking simulation) allow deeper understanding of the molecular interaction of polyphenols with heme proteins, phospholipid membrane, reactive oxygen species, and reactive carbonyl species; hence, novel hypotheses regarding their antioxidant mechanisms have been formulated.

The current study was consequently implemented to highlight the effects of natural polyphenols and/or an herbal mix on the quality characteristics of pork sausages. Five batches of sausages were manufactured using the same recipe and raw materials; the control, without sodium nitrate and natural preservatives (CON), and four groups supplemented with sodium nitrate at 0.015% (SN), olive polyphenols at 0.2% (POL), an herbal mix containing rosemary, savory, camelia, thyme, lemon balm and turmeric at 0.2% (NM), or the concomitant addition of olive polyphenols (0.1%) and the herbal mix (0.1%) (POL + NM). Assessment of pH, color, cooking loss, tenderness and oxidative stability was implemented immediately after the manufacture of the sausages (day 0) and at 1, 2 and 3 months after refrigerated storage. It was illustrated that the oxidative stability of sausages was ameliorated as a consequence of POL or/and NM addition, since the values of malondialdehyde (MDA) were significantly decreased compared to the control (p < 0.001) at months 1, 2 and 3, and the values were similar to those observed in the SN group that served as a positive control. Values for the lightness (L), shear force and cooking loss were similar among the experimental treatments (p > 0.05).

Since 1950, the worldwide plastic distribution has progressively created a serious pollution issue caused by difficulties in proper recycling, which has led to the presence of plastic fragments, called microplastics and nanoplastics (MPs/NPs), in the environment. The majority of the research has focused on the aquatic pollution, while studies regarding soil contamination are still poor, with the necessity to better understand how MPs/NPs can enter the food chain and reach humans passing through both crops and animals. Therefore, there is a need for evaluation, and the present work will provide an overview of the sources and distribution of MPs/NPs in farms; different mammalian exposure (digestion, inhalation and dermal contact) and associated risks and health problems caused by these fragments. In particular, this review aims to provide information on the effects, mainly from additives (such as Bisphenol A-BPA), on livestock reproduction and fertility. Abstract Pollution due to microplastics and nanoplastics is one of the major environmental issues of the last decade and represents a growing threat to human and animal health. In aquatic species, there is a large amount of information regarding the perturbation of marine organisms; instead, there are only a few studies focusing on the pathophysiological consequences of an acute and chronic exposure to micro- and nanoplastics in mammalian systems, especially on the reproductive system. There are several studies that have described the damage caused by plastic particles, including oxidative stress, apoptosis, inflammatory response, dysregulation of the endocrine system and accumulation in various organs. In addition to this, microplastics have recently been found to influence the evolution of microbial communities and increase the gene exchange, including antibiotic and metal resistance genes. Special attention must be paid to farm animals, because they produce food such as milk, eggs and meat, with the consequent risk of biological amplification along the food chain. The results of several studies indicate that there is an accumulation of microplastics and nanoplastics in human and animal tissues, with several negative effects, but all the effects in the body have not been ascertained, especially considering the long-term consequences.

Microplastics (MPs) are plastic materials less than 5 mm in size. They remain in the environment for hundreds to thousands of years without degrading, only breaking down further to nanoplastics (NPs). Micro- and nanoplastics can be the origin of many diseases and can carry various pathogenic substances on their surface and spread them throughout the biosphere, starting with contained additives and ending with adsorbed toxins from the environment and potentially pathogenic microorganisms. Exposure routes for humans and animals are through air, water and food/feed. Due to the placement of livestock\u2014including ruminants, fish and poultry\u2014and humans at the top of the food web, any pollution in water, air or soil can eventually be transferred to livestock and from livestock to humans. The presence of microplastics in the intestines of aquaculture species, ruminants and poultry, for instance, was found to cause a change in the intestinal microbial population and, as a result, the occurrence of diseases. These particles have also been observed in other organs such as liver, kidneys, lung, spleen, heart, ovaries, and testicles of animals, which causes biochemical changes, structural destruction, and malfunction. While the complete extent of the negative health impacts of microplastics remains still largely unknown, their ubiquitous presence and the transmission of chemicals from microplastics to organisms is a notable issue, underscoring the importance of gaining a more comprehensive understanding of the potential threats posed by microplastics to animal and ultimately human health, coupled with a need for drastic reduction of the plastic freight into the environment.

However, NOVA's connection to other sustainable diet indicators has not been thoroughly explored. The aim was to summarize the research and methodological context of using the NOVA system with other sustainable diet indicators and to investigate NOVA's synergies and discordance with them. A scoping review was conducted based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses-Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR).

Process-based models (PBMs) have long been used in agricultural crop production for predicting yield and understanding the environmental regulation of plant physiological processes and its consequences for crop growth and development. In recent years, with the increasing use of sensor and communication technologies for data acquisition in agriculture, machine learning (ML) has become a popular tool in yield prediction (especially on a large scale) and phenotyping. Both PBMs and ML are frequently used in studies on major challenges in crop production and each has its own advantages and drawbacks. We propose to combine PBMs and ML given their intrinsic complementarity, to develop knowledge- and data-driven modelling (KDDM) with high prediction accuracy as well as good interpretability. Parallel, serial and modular structures are three main modes can be adopted to develop KDDM for agricultural applications. The KDDM approach helps to simplify model parameterization by making use of sensor data and improves the accuracy of yield prediction. Furthermore, the KDDM approach has great potential to expand the boundary of current crop models to allow upscaling towards a farm, regional or global level and downscaling to the gene-to-cell level.

The study included a survey of 380 households and focus group discussions with 75 participants.The results reveal lower CSA adoption among female-headed households (51% non-adopters) compared to male-headed households (38% non-adopters). Probit and Poisson regression analyses identify several key determinants of adoption and adoption intensity, including marital status, livestock ownership, land access, and the availability of extension services. Female-headed households face unique barriers, such as smaller landholdings, labor constraints, and limited access to credit, training, and group membership.

These include implementing land reforms to ensure equitable land access for women, designing inclusive training programs that accommodate women\u2019s time constraints, and increasing the representation of female extension workers to enhance CSA knowledge dissemination among female farmers. Additionally, improving access to credit facilities for female farmers, strengthening social networks through farmer groups, and improving transport infrastructure to reduce logistical barriers are crucial to further supporting CSA adoption.

This study proposes a real-time and non-destructive food inspection system with sub-terahertz waves which penetrates non-conducting materials by using a frequency of 0.1 THz. The proposed system detects not only the presence of foreign matter, but also the degree of depth to which it is mixed in foods. In addition, the system estimates water activity levels, which serves as the basis for assessing the freshness of seaweed by analyzing the transmittance of signals within the sub-terahertz image. The system employs YOLOv8n, which is one of the newest lightweight object detection models. This lightweight model utilizes the feature pyramid network (FPN) to effectively detect objects of various sizes while maintaining a fast processing speed and high performance. In particular, to validate the performance in real manufacturing facilities, we implemented a hardware platform, which accurately inspects seaweed products while cooperating with a conveyor device moving at a speed of 45 cm/s. For the validation of the estimation performance against various water activities and the degree of depth of foreign matter, we gathered and annotated a total of 9659 sub-terahertz images and optimized the learning model. The final results show that the precision rate is 0.91, recall rate is 0.95, F1-score is 0.93, and mAP is 0.97, respectively.

It is also one of the earliest indicators of increased cardiovascular disease risk and can be considered a good predictor of the development of subclinical cardiovascular dysfunction. Arterial stiffness is a significant prognostic factor influencing cardiovascular risk, which dietary habits can modify. Obese patients should use the caloric-restricted diet because it augments aortic distensibility, diminishes pulse wave velocity (PWV), and increases the activity of endothelial nitric oxide synthases. High intake of saturated fatty acids (SFA), trans fats, and cholesterol, typical for the Western diet, impairs endothelial function and raises brachial-ankle PWV. The replacement of SFA with monounsaturated (MUFA) or polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) derived from seafood and plants diminishes the risk of arterial stiffness. The dairy product intake (excluding butter) decreases PWV in the general population. The high-sucrose diet causes toxic hyperglycemia and increases arterial stiffness. Complex carbohydrates with a low glycemic index (including isomaltose) should be recommended to keep vascular health. The high sodium intake (>10 g/day), particularly associated with low potassium consumption, has a deleterious effect on arterial stiffness (\u2191 baPWV). Since vegetables and fruits are good sources of vitamins and phytochemicals, they should be recommended in patients with high PWV.

It is thus necessary to explore the transformation mechanism and influence factors from the perspectives of microwave technology and food nutrient diversity. This manuscript focuses on the nutritional macromolecules in food, such as starch, lipid and protein, and systematically analyzes the change rule of structure, properties and function under microwave heating. Then, the flavor, health benefits, potential safety risks and bidirectional allergenicity associated with microwave heating are fully discussed. In addition, the development of new functional foods for health needs and future market based on microwave technology is also prospected.

In this study, 11 bacteria were isolated from wheat rhizosphere and examined for salt tolerance ability. WGT1, WGT2, WGT3, WGT6, WGT8, and WGT11 were able to tolerate NaCl salinity up to 4%. Bacterial isolates were characterized in vitro for plant growth-promoting properties including indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) production, phosphate solubilization, nitrogen fixation, zinc solubilization, biofilm formation, and cellulase-pectinase production. Six isolates, WGT1, WGT3, WGT4, WGT6, WGT8, and WGT9 showed IAA production ability ranging from 0.7\u20136 \u00b5g m/L. WGT8 displayed the highest IAA production. Five isolates, WGT1, WGT2, WGT5, WGT10, and WGT11, demonstrated phosphate solubilization ranging from 1.4\u201312.3 \u00b5g m/L. WGT2 showed the highest phosphate solubilization.

Biomass power plant ash (BPPA) is also rich in essential nutrients for plants, with similar carbon content. Considering production cost and agricultural waste recycling, it is beneficial to apply BPPA to improve soil fertility and quality. However, it remains unclear whether its ameliorative effects surpass those of biochar in alkaline soils. In the study, we set up seven pot experiments of faba beans in sandy alkaline soils from the ancient region of the Yellow River, including the controls (CK), different amounts of acid-modified BPPA (A1, A2, A3), and the same amounts of acid-modified biochar (B1, B2, B3), to compare their effects on soil physiochemical properties and bacterial community structure. The results indicate that the application of both biochar and BPPA can improve soil physiochemical properties. At the same dosage, the biochar application outperformed BPPA treatment in terms of soil physical properties such as bulk density (BD), maximum water-holding capacity (FC), and soil capillary porosity (SP2). Conversely, BPPA treatment displayed advantages in chemical properties such as readily oxidizable organic carbon (ROOC), total nitrogen (TN), alkaline nitrogen (AN), available phosphorus (AP), available potassium (AK), and electrical conductivity (EC). All the treatments enhanced the richness and diversity of bacterial communities, increasing the relative abundance of eutrophic groups such as Bacteroidota and Firmicutes while decreasing that of oligotrophic groups like Actinobacteriota. BPPA also increased the relative abundance of Proteobacteria, while the opposite was observed for biochar. Correlation analysis showed that the environmental factors such as soil pH, EC, TN, AK, SOM, and SP2 emerged as primary factors influencing the bacterial community structure of alkaline soils, significantly affecting their diversity and abundance. Among them, SP2 and SOM were the dominant physical and chemical factors, respectively. Overall, the application of both acid-modified BPPA and biochar can enhance the physiochemical properties of sandy alkaline soils, while the application of BPPA is superior for improving soil nutrient content and enhancing bacterial community structure.

This waste includes the cephalothoraxes, heads, shells, tails, pleopods, and exoskeleton appendages of processed shrimps. The appropriate method for the enzymatic hydrolysis of shrimp waste can recover its bioactive substances, including carotenoids. Thus, these xanthophylls and carotenes are of high financial interest and have high antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer activities. Therefore, these substances can be incorporated into fish feed as ingredients that improve fish health and simultaneously lead to the production of aquaculture fishes similar in coloration to the wild ones. Thus, the consumption of such novel food acts as a preventive factor for human health. In this regard, \u03b2-carotene has antioxidant and fat-soluble activities owing to vitamin A sufficiency and has an anti-cancer effect, too.

All hydrolysates retained alkaline peptidase activity throughout the process. Alcalase-treated hydrolysates exhibited significantly higher peptidase activity and hydrolysis degree compared to autolysis. At 60 min, Alc-0.24 reached peptidase activity levels similar to Alc-2, and by 30 min, both had comparable degrees of hydrolysis. ABTS\u00b7+ scavenging activity increased over time for Alc-0.24, with both Alcalase\u00ae 2.4L concentrations outperforming autolysis.

The rise of drug-resistant pathogens is a major challenge to modern medicine. Plant-based antimicrobials may solve this issue; hence, this review discussed in detail plant-sourced antimicrobial drugs as an alternative toward bacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens. Plant-derived chemicals from various sources such as marine, medicinal, and non-medicinal sources have diverse antimicrobial properties. Complex chemical profiles from these sources allow these molecules to interact with several targets in the microbial pathogens. Due to their multi-component composition, these compounds are more effective and less likely to acquire resistance than single-target antibiotics. Medicinal herbs have long been used for their antimicrobial properties; however, non-medicinal plants have also been identified for their antimicrobial properties. Other interesting new pathways for the identification of antimicrobials include marine plants, which contain a wide variety of metabolites that are both distinct and varied. We have conducted a thorough literature search for the medicinal, non-medicinal, and marine plant-derived molecules with antimicrobial roles from databases which include Scopus, PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science. The review also discussed the synergistic potential of combining these plant-derived compounds with traditional antimicrobial drugs to attenuate the microbial pathogenesis.

The pro-health properties of these microalgae were analysed based on the relevant literature from 2019 to 2024. The antiviral mechanism of microalgal activity involves the inhibition of viral replication and enhancement of immunity. The anti-acne activity is attributed to alkaloids, alkanes, phenols, alkenes, phycocyanins, phthalates, tannins, carboxylic and phthalic acids, saponins, and steroids. The antibacterial activity generally depends on the components and structure of the bacterial cell wall. Their healing effect results from the inhibition of inflammatory and apoptotic processes, reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, stimulation of angiogenesis, and proliferation of fibroblasts and keratinocytes. The photoprotective action is regulated by amino acids, phlorotannins, carotenoids, mycosporins, and polyphenols inhibiting the production of tyrosinase, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and free oxygen radicals in fibroblasts and the stimulation of collagen production.

Methods effectively extracting proteins contained in AP cells are demanded to provide a supply of the material.

In this paper, efficiency of the two methods is compared.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nPWE along with UAE is utilized for release of PBP from the AP cells. The extraction parameters including time, temperature, pressure, and ultrasound intensity are tested to obtain the most efficient setup. The methods were evaluated using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and the replicates of PWE extracts were further analyzed by capillary isoelectric focusing with laser-induced fluorescence (cIEF-LIF).\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe developed PWE method using higher pressure treatment at lower temperature was significantly faster than UAE methods, and the SDS-PAGE results showed a high content of phycobiliproteins in the extracts. cIEF-LIF analysis showed that the sequential PWE of individual samples was repeatable, and the mild extraction provided a fluorescent profile similar to the commercially available C-phycocyanin standard.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nPressurized water extraction was shown to be an efficient, rapid, and well-automated extraction method for AP proteins in general, including bioactive phycobiliproteins.

It provides plant nutrients and improves soil fertility. In the last decades, animal husbandry has been significantly expanded globally. Its economics were optimized via the (international) trade of feed, resulting in a surplus of animal manure in areas with intensive livestock farming. Potentially toxic elements (PTEs), pathogenic microorganisms, antibiotic residues, biocides, and other micropollutants in manure threaten animal, human, and environmental health. Hence, manure application in crop fields is increasingly restricted, especially in hotspot regions with intensive livestock activities. Furthermore, ammonia volatilization and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions during manure storage, field application, and decomposition contribute to air pollution and climate change. Conventional manure management scenarios such as composting and anaerobic digestion partially improve the system but cannot guarantee to eliminate sanitary and contamination risks and only marginally reducing its climate burden. Hence, this review discusses the potential of pyrolysis, the thermochemical conversion under oxygen\u2010limited conditions as an alternative treatment for animal manure providing energy and biochar. Manure pyrolysis reduces the bioavailability of PTEs, eliminates pathogenic microorganisms and organic micropollutants, and reduces GHG emissions. Pyrolysis also results in the loss of nitrogen, which can be minimized by pretreatment, that is, after removing soluble nitrogen fraction of manure, for example, by digestion and stripping of ammonia\u2013nitrogen or liquid\u2013solid separation. However, conclusions on the effect of manure pyrolysis on crop yield and fertilization efficiencies are hampered by a lack of nutrient mass balances based on livestock unit equivalent comparisons of manure and manure biochar applications. Hence, it is essential to design and conduct experiments in more practically relevant scenarios and depict the observations based on the amount of manure used to produce a certain amount of biochar.", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle", "Review"], "publicationDate": "2023-07-05", "synthetic_support_claim": "Manure pyrolysis reduces bioavailability of PTEs, eliminates pathogens, and reduces GHG emissions effectively.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Manure pyrolysis can completely eliminate all greenhouse gas emissions associated with manure management."}, "new_paper": {"paperId": "3064e7cb8d5e776f0247a7da43a9e3873900a3ba", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3064e7cb8d5e776f0247a7da43a9e3873900a3ba", "title": "Systemic review for the use of biochar to mitigate soil degradation", "abstract": "Biochar, a black carbon material produced by high\u2010temperature, low\u2010oxygen pyrolysis of organic solids, can improve soil properties and realize carbon neutrality.

The research compares the effects of biochar alone versus biochar combined with soybean compost on maize yield and soil properties over a period of 2.8 years. Fundamental soil properties\u2014including pH, cation exchange capacity, organic matter content, and macronutrient levels\u2014were assessed before each planting cycle and at the end of the fifth cycle. Maize yield and productivity were evaluated based on the number of maize ears, kernel biomass, and both fresh and dry kernel weights. Five experimental plots, each with four replicates, were established with the following treatments: compost applied at 0.56 kg/sq m (TM), cassava stem (CS) biochar applied alone at 2.5 kg/sq m (TB2.5) and 3.0 kg/sq m (TB3.0), and combinations of compost at 0.56 kg/sq m with CS biochar at 2.5 kg/sq m (TMB2.5) and 3.0 kg/sq m (TMB3.0). Results indicated that the sole application of biochar and its combination with compost positively affected soil properties and maize yield. Biochar applications alone significantly improved soil nutrient levels and maize yields compared to the compost alone. Notably, the beneficial effects of biochar on maize and soil were observed from the first cultivation and persisted throughout all five cycles. Based on these findings, it is recommended to apply biochar at 3.0 kg/sq m, in combination with compost at 0.56 kg/sq m, every three crop cycles to sustain nutrient levels and enhance maize yields effectively.\u00a0Doi: 10.28991/ESJ-2025-09-01-07 Full Text: PDF", "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "2025-02-01", "synthetic_support_claim": "Biochar at 3.0 kg/sq m with compost effectively enhances maize yields and sustains soil nutrients.", "synthetic_refute_claim": "Biochar application alone eliminates the need for any other soil amendments like fertilizers or compost."}}]
