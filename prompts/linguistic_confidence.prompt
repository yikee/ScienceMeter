You are given a model-generated response and your task is to decide whether the model appears confident in its answer. Focus only on how the answer is written, not what the answer is about.

Specifically, evaluate the linguistic style and tone of the response. Indicators of confidence include:
– Assertive or authoritative wording
– Decisive language (e.g., clear conclusions, minimal hedging)
– Lack of uncertainty markers (e.g., “might,” “possibly,” “it seems”)

You must answer with either “Yes” (the model sounds confident) or “No” (the model does not sound confident), based solely on the language used in the response.
